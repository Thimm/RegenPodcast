**[0:02:28-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:02:28):**  ecological health, regenerative methods of farming, and the health of the human body.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:02:33):**  Though many of you will find the connection between those three elements very intuitive,  
**[0:02:37-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:02:37):**  I've been working to find experts and practitioners who've illuminated some of the essential pieces  
**[0:02:41-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:02:41):**  of that puzzle throughout the course of this podcast. Up until now, most of the discussions  
**[0:02:47-0:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:02:47):**  on this show have focused on just one of those elements at a time, but today we'll begin  
**[0:02:52-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:02:52):**  with the first episode of a three-part series with Graham Seidt, who has made it his life's  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:02:57):**  work to marry these disciplines and train farmers, healthcare professionals, and ecologists  
**[0:03:02-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:03:02):**  around the world in the importance of caring for our bodies and our ecologies as a single  
**[0:03:07-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:03:07):**  organism that requires all of the pieces to be in place for optimal function.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:03:12):**  Graham Seidt is the internationally acclaimed author and educator who co-founded Nutratex  
**[0:03:17-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:03:17):**  Solutions or NTS and Nutrition Matters as well as hosting the Nutrition Farming podcast.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:03:23):**  He has written hundreds of published articles and the popular book Nutrition Rules. Graham  
**[0:03:28-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:03:28):**  has formulated many of the soil health and human health products for which NTS is renowned  
**[0:03:33-0:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:03:33):**  and he has developed all of the nutrition programs that are the keystone of their proactive  
**[0:03:37-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:03:37):**  management approach. Graham also owns Nutrition Farm, which comprises of two distinctly different  
**[0:03:43-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:03:43):**  properties dedicated to the production of nutrient-dense, chemical-free food with forgotten  
**[0:03:48-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:03:48):**  flavors and enhanced medicinal qualities.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:03:52):**  One of these farms is based in a subtropical zone on the Sunshine Coast of Queensland,  
**[0:03:57-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:03:57):**  Australia, while the other is situated in the coldest region of Queensland near Stanthorpe.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:04:02):**  This allows them to demonstrate nutrition farming principles in both tropical and temperate  
**[0:04:07-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:04:07):**  regions. Because our conversation turned into a marathon of learning, I decided to release  
**[0:04:12-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:04:12):**  it in three parts which will make it easier to process and find which parts to go back  
**[0:04:16-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:04:16):**  to in order to review some of the information later.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:04:20):**  In the first of these three sessions, Graham reveals the incredible personal story of how  
**[0:04:24-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:04:24):**  he came to dedicate his life to the health of people and the earth, and how it led him  
**[0:04:29-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:04:29):**  down a path that became the companies and the work that he is famous for today.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:04:33):**  From there we quickly dive into the issues facing the healthcare and pharmaceutical industry,  
**[0:04:38-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:04:38):**  different soil testing devices that anyone can use to quickly assess the health of the  
**[0:04:42-0:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:04:42):**  microbiome in the ground, and how the work of those microorganisms can release essential  
**[0:04:47-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:04:47):**  minerals like silica into plant-available forms. Graham has an incredible wealth of  
**[0:04:52-0:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:04:52):**  knowledge and you'll quickly see why I chose to break this interview into parts, because  
**[0:04:56-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:04:56):**  every snippet contains enough information for a show by itself.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:05:00):**  Now with all that said, let's hand things over to Graham.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:05:03):**  What do you say we just start from the beginning? I'm really curious as to know how you became  
**[0:05:09-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:05:09):**  passionate about the connection between how the land is managed and how this affects human  
**[0:05:15-0:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:05:15):**  health.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:05:17):**  It was kind of a strange journey into this thing. 26 years ago I had a daughter who was  
**[0:05:25-0:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:05:25):**  hit by a car and horrifically injured, and was in a coma and was sort of bouncing between  
**[0:05:30-0:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:05:30):**  life and death. And you don't sort of realize when you sign up as an organ donor that they're  
**[0:05:36-0:05:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:05:36):**  going to come to you each day and say, look, she's only ever going to be a vegetable. We've  
**[0:05:39-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:05:39):**  got little Susie waiting on her kidneys and little Jane waiting on her eyes or whatever.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:05:44):**  And I sort of hung in there and refused to turn the machines off as they sort of requested.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:05:51):**  And then all the machines she was told just started beeping at once. And basically it  
**[0:05:54-0:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:05:54):**  was, they said this is brain death approaching. And so I'm not conventionally religious, but  
**[0:05:59-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:05:59):**  I kind of know there's something there. So I kind of, for the first time in my life,  
**[0:06:02-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:06:02):**  ever made a deal that should she survive against the odds, I would do something of more value  
**[0:06:07-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:06:07):**  other than just being a successful business when I'm making money. I've got degrees in  
**[0:06:10-0:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:06:10):**  psychology and sociology, but I had a whole series of retail businesses at that time.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:06:16):**  And 20 minutes after making that deal, she came out of the coma and that evening I had  
**[0:06:20-0:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:06:20):**  to sleep this night and come up with the whole concept. I developed at that point, some kind  
**[0:06:26-0:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:06:26):**  of passion for the soil and the soil science and had begun sort of that journey. And when  
**[0:06:31-0:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:06:31):**  I sort of debated about what would be the most, the biggest thing I could give back  
**[0:06:36-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:06:36):**  kind of thing of value, I decided that I'd become an expert in soil nutrition, plant,  
**[0:06:40-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:06:40):**  animal, human nutrition. I lectured doctors on human nutrition and I didn't realise at  
**[0:06:46-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:06:46):**  that point, the profound link between soil health and planetary health that was, that  
**[0:06:50-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:06:50):**  was later probably in the last decade, that suddenly that that's become increasingly clear  
**[0:06:55-0:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:06:55):**  that, you know, this whole story of humus and the carbon cycle and sequestering carbon  
**[0:06:59-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:06:59):**  in the soil, viability, humus and so forth, it's been a more recent understanding, but  
**[0:07:04-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:07:04):**  it didn't take much research and so forth right from the start to recognise that we  
**[0:07:07-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:07:07):**  are what we eat and what we eat comes from the soil and the soil is pretty much a shadow  
**[0:07:11-0:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:07:11):**  of what it used to be with the modern sort of extractive agricultural model. And so I  
**[0:07:17-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:07:17):**  began learning all the sort of dynamics of microbial life and mineral relationships and  
**[0:07:24-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:07:24):**  the whole story of nutrition. And that's how the whole thing started.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:07:27):**  Wow, that's a remarkable story. And I've heard this from a lot of people that they've had

**[0:08:44-0:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:08:44):**  manure crops, it was all just part and parcel of farming. And then suddenly we had this  
**[0:08:48-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:08:48):**  new thing, you put it on from a bag, you could just you could make NPK fertilizers very simple,  
**[0:08:52-0:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:08:52):**  it made farming a lot more. And initially, there was a tremendous response to that to  
**[0:08:56-0:09:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:08:56):**  those minerals. And, you know, basically the simple fact is that the first cell used from

**[0:09:16-0:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:09:16):**  it down to every time you remove a crop, you take a little bit of everything off that soil.

**[0:09:50-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:09:50):**  the plate and said, okay, let's develop these rescue chemicals to save the day. And so we  
**[0:09:56-0:10:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:09:56):**  began this process of chemical farming, solving problems rather than basically addressing,  
**[0:10:03-0:10:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:10:03):**  treating symptoms rather than solving problems. And the ludicrous side of that is if you look

**[0:10:29-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:10:29):**  and more pest and disease pressure. It's literally the definition of unsustainable, putting more

**[0:10:39-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:10:39):**  into this monoculture model where you've got to get bigger or get out in many instances.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:10:45):**  And very commonly, certainly in this side of the world, large mortgages, huge debt,  
**[0:10:50-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:10:50):**  and they've got a model with this chemical extractive model that at least they know for  
**[0:10:55-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:10:55):**  sure that they're going to be able to, well, not for sure, but they're fairly confident  
**[0:10:59-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:10:59):**  because they've done it for a while. Even though they recognise they're putting more  
**[0:11:02-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:11:02):**  inputs and probably seeing more issues, they at least are paying off their mortgages and  
**[0:11:07-0:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:11:07):**  can send their kids to school and so forth. So there's a real reluctance to mess with  
**[0:11:11-0:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:11:11):**  something that's at least delivering on some level and you can't make a mistake. There's  
**[0:11:16-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:11:16):**  no leg room to make a mistake. So it makes it really difficult for them. But what I have  
**[0:11:20-0:11:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:11:20):**  discovered amongst the various in-field monitoring tools that can help with that kind of paradigm  
**[0:11:26-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:11:26):**  shift because we talk about what I call nutrition farming, there's minerals, microbes and humus  
**[0:11:32-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:11:32):**  and the interplay between those 3 things. And the microbial side, of course, is quite  
**[0:11:37-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:11:37):**  difficult because it's invisible if you're brewing specific microbes or you're working

**[0:11:46-0:11:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:11:46):**  of this very simple and expensive tool called the Microbiome meter, an American woman who  
**[0:11:51-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:11:51):**  had worked, I think, 5 patents and testing blood, retired, had a little bit of a farm

**[0:12:09-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:12:09):**  it's tremendously valuable in terms of where's your starting point, what works to improve  
**[0:12:14-0:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:12:14):**  that total microbial biomass. And it's not just the measurements, it's indiscriminate,  
**[0:12:18-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:12:18):**  it doesn't measure fungi, bacteria, protozoa, nematodes or whatever separately, it just

**[0:12:28-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:12:28):**  in 35, 30 countries a year, teaching and walking many, many hundreds of fields, my finding  
**[0:12:33-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:12:33):**  was that there was no exception, never. The best block had the highest microbial biomass

**[0:12:43-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:12:43):**  for farmers because suddenly this soil, which was seen as something you stood the plant

**[0:13:00-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:13:00):**  the best, but not all, sometimes always the best block will be much, much higher than

**[0:13:08-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:13:08):**  me and that's a huge mindset change that can make a phenomenal difference in terms of getting

**[0:25:27-0:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:25:27):**  got to understand all the mechanics of it and much more than just chucking on some NPK and some

**[0:25:54-0:25:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:25:54):**  approach. Just understanding that you're working, you're looking after the soil life, everything you  
**[0:25:58-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:25:58):**  do impacts the soil positively or negatively and you're trying to make it more positive than

**[0:26:08-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:26:08):**  basic, a tissue test, there's such a basic concept. It's just saying, what do you want plant? Oh,  
**[0:26:13-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:26:13):**  that's what you want. Okay, here it is. Usually as a folio because you've got to bypass the reasons  
**[0:26:18-0:26:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:26:18):**  that the leaf test doesn't match the soil test because you'll see a soil test and it's going to  
**[0:26:22-0:26:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:26:22):**  match the leaf test but very rarely does it match. And that's because of the interplay  
**[0:26:27-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:26:27):**  between minerals, every mineral impacts positively or negatively another or several other minerals,  
**[0:26:34-0:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:26:34):**  calcium affects 7 minerals directly. For example, that's one of the reasons you fix calcium in the  
**[0:26:39-0:26:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:26:39):**  soil before you do anything else. We call it the trapper of all minerals that directly impacts  
**[0:26:45-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:26:45):**  positively or negatively. If you've overdone lime, it shuts down 7 minerals. If you've underdone it,  
**[0:26:49-0:26:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:26:49):**  you don't have the stimulatory capacity to pull up, to have optimum access to those 7 minerals.  
**[0:26:55-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:26:55):**  So you take care of calcium first. It's all of those kinds of, there's many, many things. I  
**[0:26:59-0:27:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:26:59):**  took the days on it, but it's that model that makes a difference. And then, you know, and what  
**[0:27:05-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:27:05):**  happens when you get into this kind of biological regenerative approach is that I call it nutrition  
**[0:27:10-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:27:10):**  farming, but when you become a nutrition farmer, the passions, you know, you just, it's so much  
**[0:27:15-0:27:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:27:15):**  fun, you know, so much more fun to be working with a system rather than against it. It just  
**[0:27:19-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:27:19):**  changes everything. Yeah, that's very much in line with the farmers that we work with. And my own  
**[0:27:24-0:27:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:27:24):**  experience as well, because actually the last time I was in Australia, I was working for these  
**[0:27:28-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:27:28):**  large industrial vineyards out in Victoria. And since moving from there into permaculture and  
**[0:27:36-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:27:36):**  regenerative farms, there's no difference in the enjoyment of the work. I mean, you go from being a  
**[0:27:44-0:27:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:27:44):**  minor functioning machine doing repetitive tasks over and over again with a uniform,  
**[0:27:51-0:27:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:27:51):**  not only workday, but intention of output to one that is dynamic and collaborative and changing  
**[0:27:57-0:28:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:27:57):**  constantly and interactive with things that you are helping to steward. It's night and day  
**[0:28:03-0:28:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:28:03):**  difference. And now you were just talking about the different tests that help to determine the  
**[0:28:08-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:28:08):**  actual health. And we've been hearing tons of anecdotal evidence, as well as people referring  
**[0:28:13-0:28:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:28:13):**  to different types of tests to verify the quality or the health of the animal. And so,  
**[0:28:20-0:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:28:20):**  the health of both their soil and their plants. And I'm wondering from your side,  
**[0:28:24-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:28:24):**  which of these tests do you really rely on to give you the best picture of what's really happening?  
**[0:28:30-0:28:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:28:30):**  Because there are so many that are perhaps incomplete or just measure a certain aspect,  
**[0:28:36-0:28:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:28:36):**  and it's hard to know which ones are really going to give you definitive results.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:28:40):**  Yeah, so I'm very keen on the microbial test that I mentioned, the simple little  
**[0:28:44-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:28:44):**  microbiome meters just you can buy it on Amazon. That's from a microbial perspective, a simple,  
**[0:28:50-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:28:50):**  inexpensive infield tool that you can help you can monitor your progress along the biological path.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:28:59):**  As a measure of sort of minerals and microbes, because they interplay,  
**[0:29:02-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:29:02):**  a simple thing like a refractometer is as valuable as that. And so you understand the whole concept,  
**[0:29:07-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:29:07):**  you take some leaf, you use a garlic crusher, or sometimes you need something a bit more  
**[0:29:13-0:29:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:29:13):**  stronger than that. You squeeze a little bit of juice under the face of this little sloping tool,  
**[0:29:17-0:29:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:29:17):**  the light refracts through the dissolved solids in the set. And you're measuring your skill as  
**[0:29:22-0:29:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:29:22):**  a grower literally. You're measuring nutrient density, you're measuring, you know, amino acids,  
**[0:29:26-0:29:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:29:26):**  sugars, mainly, but sugars and amino acids, you're really measuring plant health. And it's  
**[0:29:31-0:29:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:29:31):**  called bricks levels and the higher the bricks, the better. And basically it varies between root  
**[0:29:36-0:29:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:29:36):**  crops and most other crops and root crops. You're aiming for eight degrees bricks or higher,  
**[0:29:40-0:29:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:29:40):**  and for every other crop, not every other crop, the majority of other crops is 12 or higher,  
**[0:29:44-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:29:44):**  and the higher the better. But what you find is there are no exceptions. If you've got  
**[0:29:48-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:29:48):**  insect pressure, because this is understanding the role of insects, insects are garbage collectors,  
**[0:29:55-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:29:55):**  and so you take out substandard food, and you will, there will never be an exception. You've  
**[0:30:00-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:30:00):**  got insect pressure on one field and you don't have it in the other field. The field with insect  
**[0:30:04-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:30:04):**  pressure will always, not sometimes, always have a lower bricks level, because it's called in the  
**[0:30:09-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:30:09):**  insects with that substandard and very commonly, so what causes that? Well, you know, lack of  
**[0:30:15-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:30:15):**  nutrition and misunderstanding of nutrition, over application of nitrogen very commonly,  
**[0:30:19-0:30:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:30:19):**  which is very strong. Like if you over apply nitrogen, a large percentage ends up in the  
**[0:30:25-0:30:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:30:25):**  plant and the nitrate form and nitrates are always uptaken with water and they don't stop.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:30:30):**  If it's there, they'll take it up. They take it up with water and there's a nutrient dilution factor.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:30:34):**  So you'll see if you're monitoring with the bricks level and you put out a decent dose of nitrogen,  
**[0:30:39-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:30:39):**  usually too much of a dose of nitrogen at one time, the bricks levels fall and then you're  
**[0:30:45-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:30:45):**  far more pest susceptible. So that's just a simple tool. Then there's, you know, there's some quite  
**[0:30:51-0:30:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:30:51):**  good sort of in-field tools. Now there's one of my friends in Western Australia who's developed a tool  
**[0:30:57-0:31:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:30:57):**  that measures seven things and you just plug it in, you plug it four inches into the soil and you've  
**[0:31:02-0:31:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:31:02):**  got a little box and it measures and it's quite reliable. It does NPK, which is handy to monitor  
**[0:31:06-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:31:06):**  those three minerals, but it does things like conductivity and soil temperature, soil pH.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:31:12):**  I can't remember what the seventh one is, but anyway, it's got seven things that it measures,  
**[0:31:16-0:31:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:31:16):**  just plug in and you've got that immediate roots, roots on measurement sort of thing.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:31:21):**  But we do things like sap pH is quite valid and sap pH is just basically 6.4 is where you want  
**[0:31:30-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:31:30):**  most crops to be from a sap pH perspective. But if the sap pH is more acidic, it's usually a lack  
**[0:31:35-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:31:35):**  of the key alkalizing minerals, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and there's a process of exclusion that  
**[0:31:40-0:31:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:31:40):**  can allow you to determine which one of those it is. In fact, you could just look at your  
**[0:31:44-0:31:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:31:44):**  refractometer for calcium. And when you're looking through and seeing those two hemispheres,  
**[0:31:48-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:31:48):**  that division between the two hemispheres needs to be as blurry as possible. If you're looking  
**[0:31:54-0:31:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:31:54):**  in, you've got the central access, 0 to 32 bricks and the two hemispheres cross that,  
**[0:31:59-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:31:59):**  you know, you don't really want to be able to, you want to be, so you can't tell whether it's  
**[0:32:02-0:32:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:32:02):**  12 or 13, it's just a fuzz joining those two numbers. But if you've got a sharp distinct  
**[0:32:07-0:32:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:32:07):**  line, like an old school fuel tank, which is pretty much what it looks like, that's almost  
**[0:32:13-0:32:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:32:13):**  always a screaming calcium shortage that you need to do something about. So that simple meter can  
**[0:32:18-0:32:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:32:18):**  also be a very good guideline to the very important presence of calcium. Understanding  
**[0:32:22-0:32:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:32:22):**  that calcium is, you know, if you're going to be proactive in trying to move away from chemicals,  
**[0:32:31-0:32:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:32:31):**  I mean, the starting point is to say, well, how does the fungal disease get into my crop?  
**[0:32:34-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:32:34):**  Well, it drills through quite a substantial cell wall to get to the cytoplasm, which is like the  
**[0:32:38-0:32:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:32:38):**  yolk of an egg and that becomes a food source to allow you to subdivide and the powdery mildew  
**[0:32:44-0:32:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:32:44):**  grows on the underside of your zucchini leaves sort of thing. But first it's got to get to that  
**[0:32:48-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:32:48):**  wall. And if you're a small sap sucker, you've got to chomp through a substantial cell wall to  
**[0:32:52-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:32:52):**  get to that same yolk, that cytoplasm. And the obvious thing is, well, what's it made of? What  
**[0:32:57-0:33:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:32:57):**  strengthens the cell wall? And how can I make a difference in terms of creating that barrier?  
**[0:33:02-0:33:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:33:02):**  And that's calcium at luxury levels on a leaf test. We went right at the top zone. If it's  
**[0:33:07-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:33:07):**  0.4 to 0.6, the acceptable for that crop, we went up to 0.6 because of that role amongst many.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:33:13):**  And equally important to calcium is the trace, not trace mineral, but the mineral silica.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:33:19):**  And there have been 9 international silica conferences in the last 12 years. And silica  
**[0:33:23-0:33:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:33:23):**  is like the flavour of the month in agriculture now. It's not even an essential nutrient,  
**[0:33:28-0:33:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:33:28):**  but it's absolutely critical with calcium for that cell strength. And now we find with silica,  
**[0:33:34-0:33:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:33:34):**  this amazing finding, there's been 7 published papers just recently on the subject that silica  
**[0:33:40-0:33:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:33:40):**  is actually an immunolycitor. And immunolycitation is a really good thing for farmers to play with,  
**[0:33:45-0:33:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:33:45):**  because there are no exceptions. Every known immunolycitor, whether it's something like  
**[0:33:50-0:33:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:33:50):**  salicylic acid or some of the many, many compounds, including the hormones found in kelp,  
**[0:33:56-0:34:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:33:56):**  whatever you're using, that has been shown to boost immune response, which is quite measurable  
**[0:34:01-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:34:01):**  now, that also induces a yield response. You always get a higher yield if you boost immunity.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:34:07):**  And so people using substances like potassium silica have been reporting these 20% and 30%  
**[0:34:11-0:34:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:34:11):**  yield increases. And I've scratched my head in explaining that, of course, there's the  
**[0:34:17-0:34:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:34:17):**  translocation of nutrients, silica is the main building block of flowers on the islands,  
**[0:34:22-0:34:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:34:22):**  so you're going to get a translocation and that would account for some kind of years,  
**[0:34:25-0:34:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:34:25):**  but not those kind of increases. And then when you see all these studies pour out about  
**[0:34:29-0:34:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:34:29):**  immunolycitation, you suddenly realise that that always increases yield and sometimes quite  
**[0:34:35-0:34:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:34:35):**  substantially, and that's the bigger player. So silica has become quite a story in the equation.  
**[0:34:39-0:34:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:34:39):**  And of course, it was never even measured or considered to be of any role in plants. But I was  
**[0:34:45-0:34:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:34:45):**  in India, I was traveling to India twice a year prior to COVID. And I came across this article  
**[0:34:52-0:35:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:34:52):**  in an Indian journal from a woman professor who had been analysing some ancient Ayurvedic texts,  
**[0:35:00-0:35:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:35:00):**  and she was suggesting that in 3000 years ago in India, according to these texts, Indian agriculture  
**[0:35:06-0:35:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:35:06):**  was governed by four microbial preparations, all of which use lacto fermentation, which is a huge  
**[0:35:12-0:35:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:35:12):**  thing for extraction, we use it all the time on my farms, it's something I really, really promote  
**[0:35:16-0:35:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:35:16):**  for do it yourself micro brewing is the concept of potentially to pull out things like garlic,  
**[0:35:22-0:35:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:35:22):**  you could plant so many compounds from garlic, but then become a value,  
**[0:35:25-0:35:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:35:25):**  extracting and well, that's what they were doing. And interestingly, there was one form of hibiscus,  
**[0:35:29-0:35:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:35:29):**  it was in all four of those herbal formulas, but there were four or five different pairs, but one  
**[0:35:34-0:35:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:35:34):**  central one and all the formulas. And one of them was the nitrogen fixation to stimulate nitrogen  
**[0:35:39-0:35:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:35:39):**  fixing organisms, one of them was to stimulate phosphate solubilising organisms, one was to  
**[0:35:44-0:35:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:35:44):**  stimulate potassium solubilising organisms and fourth one was to simulate silica solubilising  
**[0:35:50-0:35:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:35:50):**  organisms. Because what we know is silica is the most abundant mineral and the core of the earth is  
**[0:35:54-0:36:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:35:54):**  largely silica, the sands are silicates, clays are aluminosilicates, the soil is full of silica,  
**[0:36:01-0:36:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:36:01):**  but the plant available forms called monosilicic acid, and it's just at 20 parts per million of  
**[0:36:06-0:36:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:36:06):**  most soils when it needs to be 100 parts per million. And something we've done is taken it  
**[0:36:11-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:36:11):**  it appears to be a microbial thing. And we haven't even identified the specific organisms responsible,  
**[0:36:16-0:36:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:36:16):**  but we've knocked out because organic soils usually have more than inorganic. So we know  
**[0:36:22-0:36:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:36:22):**  it's a chemical or a group of chemicals and there is some suspicion that glyphosate might be involved  
**[0:36:26-0:36:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:36:26):**  the something's knocking around the organisms that makes silica into the plant available form  
**[0:36:31-0:36:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:36:31):**  is the finding. So then it becomes a heck of a change that and what you can do and we  
**[0:36:36-0:36:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-1/#t=0:36:36):**  teach all of those kind of strategies to bring silica back into the equation.

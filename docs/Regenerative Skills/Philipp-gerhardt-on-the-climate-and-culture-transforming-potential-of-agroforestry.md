**[0:03:12-0:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:03:12):**  and are building new climate-friendly ways of doing business.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:03:15):**  Now I first got to know Philipp in person when I was working with our team at Climate  
**[0:03:19-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:03:19):**  Farmers to organize our conference last year.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:03:22):**  I was thrilled to find him in our group of agroforestry nerds, and I learned so much  
**[0:03:26-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:03:26):**  from him in just a few days.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:03:28):**  One of my highlights from the event, in fact, was getting to listen in on the conversations  
**[0:03:32-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:03:32):**  that Philipp and Mark Sheppard had about the history and evolution of forestry science,  
**[0:03:38-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:03:38):**  and I knew that I had to get Philipp on an episode one day.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:03:41):**  Well, it finally happened, and the result was an hour and a half conversation that I  
**[0:03:45-0:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:03:45):**  split into two parts, in which Philipp and I explore both high-level concepts of integrating  
**[0:03:50-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:03:50):**  trees into agricultural landscapes, and the role that they play in restoring the healthy  
**[0:03:54-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:03:54):**  function of the hydrological cycle of the land, all the way through detailed stories  
**[0:03:59-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:03:59):**  of case studies and projects that Philipp and I are working on.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:04:02):**  There's really so much useful and practical information in these sessions, so instead  
**[0:04:06-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:04:06):**  of giving a drawn-out introduction, I'm just going to hand things over to Dr. Philipp Gerhard.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:04:13):**  I think a really good place to start is to go back to that conference where you and I  
**[0:04:17-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:04:17):**  first met, because I distinctly remember listening in on a really cool conversation with you  
**[0:04:22-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:04:22):**  and Mark Sheppard, in which you started to talk about the history of formal agroforestry  
**[0:04:29-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:04:29):**  and forestry management, and some of the people who've inspired and influenced your own work.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:04:35):**  With that in mind, maybe we can go to the beginning of how you began to work in forestry,  
**[0:04:40-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:04:40):**  and some of the people in the work that have influenced you along the way.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:04:44):**  Yeah, yeah, there's a very, very strong influence of the, well, we call them forestry classics,  
**[0:04:56-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:04:56):**  like Forstliche Klassiker in German, because it was in the classic period, like the same  
**[0:05:01-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:05:01):**  time as Goethe and Schiller, beginning of the 19th century, end of the 18th century,  
**[0:05:09-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:05:09):**  and well, these were the people basically inventing modern forestry.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:05:15):**  And so what does that have to do with my work?  
**[0:05:20-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:05:20):**  I studied forestry in Taarand, which is a very small village near Dresden in Germany.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:05:27):**  It only has 1000 or 1500 inhabitants, but 600 forestry students.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:05:35):**  And it's the oldest forestry academy in the world.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:05:41):**  And it was founded by Heinrich Kotta.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:05:44):**  And yeah, he grew up in central Germany in Thuringia as the child of a forester.  
**[0:05:53-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:05:53):**  And he learned forest management like from early on, and he educated himself scientifically.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:06:00):**  And then he was called by the Saxon king to build up this academy.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:06:05):**  And by the beginning of the 19th century, he was already like famous in the German world  
**[0:06:17-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:06:17):**  in Central Europe, because it was many states, like he was called to many different states  
**[0:06:21-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:06:21):**  to teach and to advise on forestry issues.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:06:27):**  And then he wrote a very small book, which is mostly unrecognized today.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:06:37):**  It's called Die Bamfelte Wichhauft, like tree fields economy, you might translate it.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:06:45):**  And the subtitle was, was like, combining silviculture and agriculture.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:06:51):**  Yeah, that's basically the first book about agroforestry.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:06:57):**  I think I've never heard about any other work that's distinctly creating this idea of putting  
**[0:07:06-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:07:06):**  trees in the fields.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:07:07):**  And why did he write that?  
**[0:07:09-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:07:09):**  Because he, besides being the director of the Forestry Academy, he was also the Saxon  
**[0:07:18-0:07:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:07:18):**  Royal Forest Inspector.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:07:20):**  So he traveled through the whole kingdom, measuring the forests and telling foresters  
**[0:07:26-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:07:26):**  what to do.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:07:27):**  And because it was a big issue at that time to get sustainability into forestry, people  
**[0:07:33-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:07:33):**  struggled because they had less forest area than today, they had not enough wood.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:07:38):**  And so the states were really struggling, how can we get a sustainable wood production?  
**[0:07:43-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:07:43):**  How can we manage forests?  
**[0:07:44-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:07:44):**  How can we, in the first place, measure what's in the forest?  
**[0:07:48-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:07:48):**  And how much can we take out?  
**[0:07:50-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:07:50):**  How much do we need to replant?  
**[0:07:51-0:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:07:51):**  And that was the time when all these forestry or forest inventory techniques developed.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:07:59):**  So he traveled very far.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:08:01):**  And after the Napoleonic Wars, he saw that there were huge famines in the regions, which  
**[0:08:12-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:08:12):**  were thought to be the most productive arable areas.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:08:21):**  So where they grew a lot of cereals, there were famines.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:08:25):**  And then in other regions, which were like more structured on a small scale, had a lot  
**[0:08:31-0:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:08:31):**  of hedges or growing fruit trees, apples and walnuts, he discovered that the famine wasn't  
**[0:08:41-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:08:41):**  really taking place.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:08:43):**  And that was because in the wars, the fields got destroyed, all people didn't plow them,  
**[0:08:49-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:08:49):**  didn't sow, and so they had nothing to harvest.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:08:52):**  But in these small scale structured regions, people just switched over to the old practices  
**[0:08:59-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:08:59):**  of harvesting wild fruits and eating them.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:09:06):**  And rich farmers would usually just eat food from arable land.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:09:15):**  They would eat a lot of grains because it's a statues symbol.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:09:21):**  But you can see that in museums that they had, especially small farmers, still had a  
**[0:09:28-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:09:28):**  lot of devices from the 18th century to collect something like hawthorn and small berries  
**[0:09:36-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:09:36):**  and just smash them and then dry the outcome.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:09:43):**  So they have a kind of leathery fruit thing that you can just rip off pieces and chew.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:09:51):**  Early fruit roll ups.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:09:52):**  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  
**[0:09:54-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:09:54):**  And yeah, and so he was inspired by that and said, hey, wow, why don't we just grow more  
**[0:10:02-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:02):**  tree crops?  
**[0:10:04-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:04):**  And that's actually the thing that would stabilize the economy, that would make it resilient.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:10):**  And that would, on the other hand, tackle this problem of the state having not enough  
**[0:10:21-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:21):**  wood because you would grow wood outside the forest.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:26):**  You would basically area for wood production that hasn't been used before.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:32):**  And on the other hand, he saw that the grain production could benefit from it as well.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:40):**  And it's very fascinating that he wrote the book in 1819 and he has a list of benefits  
**[0:10:46-0:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:46):**  that agroforestry would bring.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:48):**  And the last one is even the climate would improve.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:52):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:53):**  That's way ahead of its time.  
**[0:10:56-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:56):**  Yeah, way ahead.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:57):**  200 years ahead of his time.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:00):**  Definitely.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:01):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:02):**  The place where he was teaching 200 years before and all the professors said, yeah,  
**[0:11:05-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:05):**  read the works of Heinrich Kotterer.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:07):**  And he's so famous and he's such a giant and he had such ideas.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:11):**  And I was like, come on, blah, blah.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:13):**  I just want to finish my studies and I have enough to do.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:16):**  So I never actually read the stuff.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:18):**  But then a couple of years after my studies, I didn't want to do forestry because I found  
**[0:11:24-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:24):**  it also, how to say, over administered, you might say.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:33):**  And so I did something else.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:36):**  I worked with a blacksmith and I did some instrument building and crafts and stuff.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:44):**  And then but then I met a guy, a friend of mine who was into the permaculture scene and  
**[0:11:49-0:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:49):**  said, yeah, you know, you've studied forestry.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:53):**  Why don't you come to the agroforestry campaign meetings?  
**[0:11:57-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:57):**  There was a thing.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:12:00):**  It was called Agroforestkampagne.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:12:02):**  It was kind of a loose thing where some people met that were interested in promoting agroforestry.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:12:11):**  And that actually led to the founding of the German Agroforestry Federation two or three  
**[0:12:17-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:12:17):**  years ago.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:12:19):**  So it's we now have like a big institution that can get funds and we're really working  
**[0:12:24-0:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:12:24):**  to promote agroforestry.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:12:27):**  But at that time, it was just a bunch of enthusiasts meeting on an regular basis.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:12:33):**  And so I went to one of these meetings and there I got in touch with a guy who somebody  
**[0:12:42-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:12:42):**  gave me an article about historic agroforestry systems in Germany.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:12:48):**  And then in that report, Heinrich Kotta and his book were mentioned as like, what?  
**[0:12:57-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:12:57):**  This forestry science guy who so famous wrote something about agroforestry.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:02):**  I need to read that.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:03):**  And so I got the book and read it.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:06):**  And then it was like, wow, I kind of grew up in this tradition, like with my studies,  
**[0:13:12-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:12):**  I learned the stuff that he taught and I began to revise the stuff I learned.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:20):**  And then I was like, wow, I actually learned agroforestry practice.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:25):**  I learned how to do it.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:26):**  I just learned it for the forest.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:28):**  I learned how to deal with trees, but I can plant them in a row as well.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:34):**  And I don't care if there's like a clear cut in between or if it's a grain field.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:40):**  So I can do much of the stuff that's necessary to promote agroforestry.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:47):**  And then I got in touch with Keyline Design also by a friend of mine who said, hey, look  
**[0:13:53-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:53):**  at this.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:54):**  And I read it, I just flipped across the book of humans.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:58):**  And I was like, wow, I learned a lot of that in forestry.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:02):**  I can do geodesy and road building, ditch building and leveling stuff.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:10):**  And yeah, so I was inspired to work in this field again.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:16):**  I was like, why am I doing crafts stuff and working on such a small scale when the world  
**[0:14:24-0:14:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:24):**  needs this now and I can do it.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:26):**  I can contribute to that.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:27):**  It's important to do now because we need to do something to, that's the way I got into  
**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:34):**  this and it was largely inspired.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:38):**  It's largely unknown.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:40):**  And there's this knowledge base that we have.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:44):**  And yeah, so I think that's it.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:47):**  Well, that's fascinating because it sounds like the origins of forestry management and  
**[0:14:53-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:53):**  agroforestry not only were very similar, but we're a lot further ahead of their time than  
**[0:14:57-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:57):**  what we currently associate with both of these practices.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:01):**  And maybe you can give me an idea of where you see forestry being at the moment.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:06):**  I mean, you were saying before that you got out of it originally because it was over administered  
**[0:15:10-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:10):**  or perhaps too bureaucratic.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:13):**  What do most people think of forestry management at the moment and how has it kind of gotten  
**[0:15:18-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:18):**  away from its original intent?  
**[0:15:20-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:20):**  Yeah, well, there's one thing that's maybe the most significant.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:25):**  Heinrich Kottner wrote, he wrote a book about forest management and about like forestry  
**[0:15:41-0:15:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:41):**  science and how to deal with the forests scientifically and from the administration point of view.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:48):**  And then the foreword he wrote, who allowed this feeble science to look at the need to  
**[0:15:56-0:16:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:56):**  see the forest in connection with the landscape.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:00):**  That was in the foreword of this book.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:01):**  And I think that's something that we lost along the way.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:07):**  I tend to say that the forests aren't saved in the forests.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:12):**  They're saved out in the fields because we have patches of forests in a landscape that  
**[0:16:23-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:23):**  needs more trees, you might say, because the climate isn't working.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:27):**  We have these huge arable fields and agricultural landscapes and they're drying out, they're  
**[0:16:32-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:32):**  heating up.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:33):**  And how can we protect forests, for example, in central Europe with beach trees that need  
**[0:16:40-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:40):**  a moist and cool climate and they're dying in the forests.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:46):**  And now if you do forest restoration and you go from spruce forests, from pine forests  
**[0:16:55-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:55):**  to beach forests, it won't work.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:17:00):**  They will be gone in the next decades because the climate is heating up.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:17:03):**  So we need to do something in the landscape.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:17:05):**  And that's this idea of the bomb fed, which of the tree fields economy, that you give  
**[0:17:13-0:17:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:17:13):**  the landscape more roughness, more photosynthesis, more biologic production, and also more evaporation  
**[0:17:28-0:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:17:28):**  so that it cools the climate.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:17:30):**  And there are studies nowadays which show that if we change the landscape to an agroforestry  
**[0:17:37-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:17:37):**  landscape, with just 10% agroforestry in central Europe, you might lower the temperature by  
**[0:17:43-0:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:17:43):**  almost a degree in modeling studies.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:17:47):**  And that is very, very significant.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:17:49):**  And we see that the beach trees in the forests are dying because of 1.5 degrees warmth that  
**[0:17:59-0:18:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:17:59):**  we already have.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:18:00):**  So if we can get back to like one degree less, we create the conditions in which the forest  
**[0:18:08-0:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:18:08):**  that we would like to have can survive.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:18:10):**  So that's one point.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:18:13):**  Like we need to see the forests in connection with the landscape.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:18:17):**  And the other thing is that we have a mindset now of the mindset we have with forests or  
**[0:18:28-0:18:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:18:28):**  the attitude we have towards forests is largely defined by people in cities because more and  
**[0:18:34-0:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:18:34):**  more people live in cities.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:18:36):**  And there's kind of a hypocrisy you might say, because people want natural forests.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:18:46):**  They want to have like forest preserves.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:18:49):**  They want to have dead wood and forests for leisure time activities, but they consume  
**[0:18:59-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:18:59):**  more and more wood.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:19:00):**  How can people in Germany actually demand that forests are put under protection and  
**[0:19:05-0:19:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:19:05):**  not used anymore, and on the other hand, go to Ikea every two weeks and get new furniture?  
**[0:19:12-0:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:19:12):**  That doesn't work.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:19:15):**  At the moment, I'm in Berlin and we have the Groenewald forest here just in the vicinity  
**[0:19:22-0:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:19:22):**  and it's developing towards like a, I don't know, leisure time forest.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:19:29):**  Like there's so much dead wood, it's so much broadleaf trees and everything, and it's in  
**[0:19:35-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:19:35):**  large parts not used anymore.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:19:39):**  And then outside in the country about there, you have these huge pine plantations.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:19:43):**  And so that's the second point.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:19:46):**  We need to manage forests and we can't say, oh, we just want native species and natural  
**[0:19:53-0:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:19:53):**  forests, blah, blah.  
**[0:19:55-0:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:19:55):**  We need to manage them because we are using them and we can't not use them.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:20:00):**  We need wood.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:20:01):**  It's one of the basic resources for a lot of things.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:20:05):**  And we need the forests to be there in the landscape, to cool the landscape.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:20:10):**  First we need agroforestry landscapes, which has a much larger effect in terms of cooling  
**[0:20:15-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:20:15):**  and moistening the landscapes again.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:20:18):**  And the third point is the way how we manage forests, but that's linked to this urban mindset.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:20:24):**  I already mentioned it that people demand we have only natural or native species in  
**[0:20:33-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:20:33):**  the forest.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:20:34):**  So that doesn't work anymore because we're getting a hotter climate.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:20:41):**  And in climate simulations, for example, beach trees, which would now cover most of the medium  
**[0:20:54-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:20:54):**  sites in Germany, it would retreat basically to the upper levels of the Bavarian forest,  
**[0:21:01-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:21:01):**  for example, where it's nowadays really damp and cold and you have spruce growing.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:21:08):**  So we need to experiment with new tree species and also with new silvicultural measures to  
**[0:21:19-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:21:19):**  establish forests and to manage them.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:21:21):**  We need to get back to more pioneer trees in the forests, like growing poplars, for  
**[0:21:29-0:21:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:21:29):**  example, if we have places in the forest and that happens now because of climate change,  
**[0:21:35-0:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:21:35):**  where you get huge cleared areas because of bark beetle or forest fires, we need to maybe  
**[0:21:43-0:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:21:43):**  adapt a bit of these agroforestry practices.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:21:46):**  In agroforestry we know we're planting into a desert climate basically because that's  
**[0:21:51-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:21:51):**  what arable land ecology is and we need to plant very strong trees and we really need  
**[0:22:04-0:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:22:04):**  to take care of how there's no use in plant trees on a huge clear cut or forest fire area.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:22:11):**  So I would basically apply agroforestry practices there as well, planting poplars first and  
**[0:22:17-0:22:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:22:17):**  not using natural regeneration but just letting the poplars fly in.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:22:22):**  Because that's too slow, we need to get more speed into the reforestation to get the carbon  
**[0:22:29-0:22:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:22:29):**  in the soil again.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:22:31):**  And so I would actually use what we use in agroforestry, like 1m80, 2m poplar cuttings  
**[0:22:42-0:22:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:22:42):**  to put them in the soil as deep as possible and let them grow rapidly and then go in with  
**[0:22:50-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:22:50):**  the trees that follow the pioneers, for example, oaks and other shade tolerant trees.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:22:57):**  And that's also economically interesting because we have a huge degree of mechanisation and  
**[0:23:04-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:23:04):**  we need to go in with harvesters and we need to build skidding tracks.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:23:11):**  And so you could put the poplars on the future skidding tracks and then with the first thinning  
**[0:23:20-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:23:20):**  of the young growth in 20 years, 25 years, the harvester can just harvest, like ready  
**[0:23:27-0:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:23:27):**  to harvest poplars on the skidding tracks.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:23:31):**  I guess my next question is probably quite in line with what you just laid out but what  
**[0:23:35-0:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:23:35):**  are some of the biggest threats to the health of forests in the areas that you've worked  
**[0:23:40-0:23:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:23:40):**  so far?  
**[0:23:41-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:23:41):**  Is it related to the shift in temperature and poor management practices or are there  
**[0:23:46-0:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:23:46):**  other things like disease and insects and other threats?  
**[0:23:51-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:23:51):**  I would say it's all linked to the drought and the heating up of the atmosphere.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:24:00):**  We have in the area where I live in Brandenburg, Eastern Germany, we have huge pine plantations.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:24:07):**  It's pine monoculture in most of the forests and that makes them very vulnerable, of course,  
**[0:24:16-0:24:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:24:16):**  to diseases and pests.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:24:20):**  But if you have a healthy pine tree, it can resist these pests and diseases.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:24:26):**  But the trees aren't healthy anymore because it's too dry and too hot.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:24:30):**  And so it's mostly linked to climate issues.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:24:36):**  It worked for 150 years to have these monoculture plantations because people managed to manage  
**[0:24:44-0:24:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:24:44):**  them in a healthy condition but we don't have it anymore.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:24:48):**  So I think the thing we really need to do now is scale up agroforestry in the next 10  
**[0:24:57-0:25:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:24:57):**  years so that we have, it would be necessary to basically have agroforestry everywhere.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:25:04):**  On every field there needs to be agroforestry but that of course can be like grains with  
**[0:25:11-0:25:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:25:11):**  chestnut, rose, can be like a popular rose for farming.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:25:18):**  Because we have huge agroforestry with large-scale farming, so I can't tell people to do like  
**[0:25:25-0:25:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:25:25):**  very fiddly mixed species plantings like some guys from South America promote.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:25:33):**  It doesn't work here so we need to get into a different thinking of dynamic agroforestry.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:25:39):**  Of course we need to use the pioneer species and then we can come after them with trees  
**[0:25:50-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:25:50):**  that need like moisture and less windy and less dry conditions.  
**[0:25:56-0:25:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:25:56):**  But we can't do like mixed plantings and everything.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:25:58):**  So it's a good idea to really scale it up to do what farming businesses nowadays can  
**[0:26:07-0:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:26:07):**  actually manage and that's heating and get a lot of poplars for chip wood on the fields.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:26:15):**  Much much better than what we have outside in the landscape now.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:26:18):**  So that's what I would say, let's do that at least in Eastern Germany or in the drier  
**[0:26:24-0:26:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:26:24):**  areas of the northern German plains, it also would apply to Poland and to areas like Eastern  
**[0:26:32-0:26:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:26:32):**  Austria, Hungary, some areas in France.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:26:36):**  Just take agriculture as it is and put in pioneer tree strips for chip wood production,  
**[0:26:49-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:26:49):**  for bioeconomy that suits the practices they have.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:26:54):**  And if it's 48 meters or 72 meters, I don't care.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:26:59):**  If you have small scale businesses and you have young enthusiastic farmers which only  
**[0:27:04-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:27:04):**  have 10 hectares, then okay let's do a chestnut forest and produce chestnuts.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:27:09):**  I'm really going for a woody agriculture and I think we should eat chestnuts and nuts but  
**[0:27:19-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:27:19):**  it won't work with the economy we have now and the agricultural businesses.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:27:23):**  So yeah, to save the forest we need to scale up agroforestry really really fast to cool  
**[0:27:30-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:27:30):**  down the regional climate and that basically means turning the agricultural landscape into  
**[0:27:36-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:27:36):**  a big cooler.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:27:38):**  If you look at an agricultural, at an agroforestry field, it also looks like the cooler of a  
**[0:27:45-0:27:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:27:45):**  car or a heating radiator.  
**[0:27:49-0:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:27:49):**  You have the structure with these fine strips that make a cooler having more surface area.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:28:04):**  And that's exactly what...  
**[0:28:05-0:28:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:28:05):**  Oh yeah, like the baffle plates or the fins.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:28:07):**  Fins, yeah you might think that.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:28:12):**  So if you look at a car cooler and that's how our fields must look.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:28:19):**  And that's a really good way of putting it.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:28:21):**  Yeah from like an engineering standpoint.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:28:23):**  So those are the areas that are helping to dissipate the heat that are in the cultivated  
**[0:28:29-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:28:29):**  rows in between.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:28:30):**  And I would imagine they have somewhat of a similar effect of holding moisture down  
**[0:28:34-0:28:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:28:34):**  at the lower levels of the fields as well.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:28:38):**  Yeah that's what we actually found out, we have some scientific studies already going  
**[0:28:44-0:28:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:28:44):**  on and actually a colleague of mine who studied with me, he did a study where he compared  
**[0:28:54-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:28:54):**  a lot with yields on a big area with more grain yield in the agroforestry plot and it  
**[0:28:59-0:29:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:28:59):**  could be explained by the less evaporative stress because there's more view in between  
**[0:29:15-0:29:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:29:15):**  the agroforestry rows and more moisture and that's why the cereals grow better.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:29:22):**  And in terms of the cooling effect that's also if you have this huge surface area with  
**[0:29:28-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:29:28):**  leaves and photosynthesis there's a lot of evaporation.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:29:32):**  And you might say okay then the water is gone but it's not because we're enriching the lower  
**[0:29:40-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:29:40):**  air layers with moisture and then and the more moisture you have in the air the less  
**[0:29:46-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:29:46):**  the evaporative stress is.  
**[0:29:48-0:30:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:29:48):**  And then if you have this structure in meteorology we talk about a high what's it called roughness  
**[0:30:01-0:30:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:30:01):**  element density.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:30:03):**  So if you do yeah if you put a lot of roughness elements in the fields you have a high roughness  
**[0:30:10-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:30:10):**  and that lowers the wind speed and that means the moisture the moist air stays there.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:30:15):**  So yeah it protects the grains and so and the water is not gone and then if you have  
**[0:30:22-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:30:22):**  turbulence which is created by the roughness as well then the moist air needs to go up  
**[0:30:29-0:30:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:30:29):**  but it's cooler than if you just have arable land.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:30:33):**  And then you if it's cooler you get to the point where it formed clouds much earlier  
**[0:30:39-0:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:30:39):**  and then you have precipitation and that's what we call precipitation recycling.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:30:44):**  If you look at an arable landscape without agroforestry it's heating up much quicker.  
**[0:30:52-0:31:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:30:52):**  If you look at birds of prey they usually circle above freshly plowed fields because  
**[0:31:00-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:31:00):**  there's a lot of heat going up.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:31:03):**  And also if you look at harvested fields the air is like has this wavering pattern you  
**[0:31:13-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:31:13):**  like you can see the heat and the birds will also circle above these fields.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:31:20):**  And if you then go towards hedges or agroforestry strips tree strips then you can still catch  
**[0:31:32-0:31:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:31:32):**  some moisture with your feet in the fields by midday or in the afternoon.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:31:37):**  And that's the effect where we're getting more moisture and that cools the air.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:31:48):**  It's there for the plants to use, it's usable by the plants and the whole cloud formation  
**[0:31:56-0:31:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:31:56):**  and precipitation.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:31:58):**  So we're closing the regional water cycle and that means more moisture and cooler air.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:32:05):**  And all of this is closely tied in with the local water cycle and the hydrological health  
**[0:32:11-0:32:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:32:11):**  of the land.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:32:12):**  Oh yes.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:32:13):**  And trees play such a big role in that.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:32:15):**  I know you talked about your study and your applications of key line design as well.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:32:21):**  Can you talk about the hydrological element of reforestation and the health of forests  
**[0:32:27-0:32:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:32:27):**  as well as some of the considerations perhaps when you're planting new trees about making  
**[0:32:32-0:32:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:32:32):**  sure that there's enough water in the system so that they can get established?  
**[0:32:37-0:32:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:32:37):**  Yeah, that's a very interesting topic, water cycle.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:32:43):**  And well, in Brandenburg we had the like, you know that Tesla is building the first  
**[0:32:52-0:32:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:32:52):**  big factory in Europe just outside Berlin in Brandenburg.  
**[0:32:55-0:33:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:32:55):**  And there was a huge debate on how much water the factory would use and how to get that  
**[0:33:02-0:33:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:33:02):**  back into the ground because we're having this problem that the water level is dropping  
**[0:33:09-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:33:09):**  and dropping in Brandenburg because we're basically drying out.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:33:13):**  And then Elon Musk promised to plant I think three times as much forest as he was obliged  
**[0:33:23-0:33:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:33:23):**  to plant by law because he built this factory.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:33:31):**  And I always thought that all the trees they're planting, they would be much more efficient  
**[0:33:38-0:33:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:33:38):**  if they not planted them like in one place to restore a forest but to spread them out  
**[0:33:47-0:33:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:33:47):**  on the fields and produce a lot of agroforestry because we then have this cooler effect.  
**[0:33:53-0:34:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:33:53):**  And that does, and then we can catch more rain and if we can catch more rain then get  
**[0:34:03-0:34:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:34:03):**  more water in the ground again.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:34:05):**  And then if you have agroforestry for example, you could regard that as a medium density  
**[0:34:16-0:34:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:34:16):**  savannah or something.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:34:19):**  And we know that in forests you have less water going into the ground and recharging  
**[0:34:28-0:34:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:34:28):**  the groundwater but when you have a lot of rain can get on the ground but the ground  
**[0:34:34-0:34:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:34:34):**  is also receptive for this rain because it's kept moist by the vicinity of the agroforestry  
**[0:34:45-0:34:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:34:45):**  strips.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:34:46):**  Because of the dew that we have soil it won't let us, it's hard and it's dried out and then  
**[0:34:54-0:34:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:34:54):**  you have a lot of surface runoff.  
**[0:34:56-0:35:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:34:56):**  So a dried out soil won't let the next rain event, won't let it in.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:35:03):**  So you need a soil that is already a bit moist so that the pores are open and that's what  
**[0:35:10-0:35:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:35:10):**  we have in agroforestry.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:35:11):**  But then like this is the benefit and we don't have the, what's the opposite of a benefit  
**[0:35:20-0:35:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:35:20):**  drawback?  
**[0:35:21-0:35:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:35:21):**  We don't have the drawback of a closed canopy holding up the rain.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:35:30):**  So we know that in general a light tree cover like a savannah structure is better for groundwater  
**[0:35:40-0:35:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:35:40):**  to recharge than a closed canopy forest.  
**[0:35:44-0:35:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:35:44):**  And yeah, and that's something we can adapt to in forest management as well because I  
**[0:35:51-0:36:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:35:51):**  think the way we are doing forestry is not suited to the demand of the industry anymore  
**[0:36:01-0:36:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:36:01):**  and we can try to do more copies with standards forestry again which would lead to the forests  
**[0:36:10-0:36:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:36:10):**  having more of a cooler structure with a lot of surface area.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:36:18):**  But the second thing is there's two more things.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:36:22):**  The one thing is very obvious we need to have more broadleaf trees in the forests.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:36:30):**  I don't think we need to talk about that.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:36:33):**  That's common knowledge now, okay.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:36:34):**  That's what people already really got.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:36:36):**  Well go ahead and break it down anyway for people who don't understand the difference  
**[0:36:40-0:36:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:36:40):**  of the interaction of broadleaf trees and coniferous trees or evergreen trees in a forestry  
**[0:36:46-0:36:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:36:46):**  configuration.  
**[0:36:50-0:36:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:36:50):**  So the thing is broadleaf trees first they lose their foliage in winter time so the interception  
**[0:36:59-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:36:59):**  of rainwater in winter is less so we get more of the winter rainfall into the soil.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:37:07):**  And second, the foliage of broadleaf trees decays much quicker because needles are made  
**[0:37:15-0:37:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:37:15):**  to have maximum resistance against a tough climate and that means there's a lot of substances  
**[0:37:27-0:37:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:37:27):**  in the needle and the form is adapted to not being easy to attack by microorganisms, by  
**[0:37:39-0:37:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:37:39):**  temperature, everything.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:37:40):**  So if a needle falls through the ground it needs much longer to decay and is less suitable  
**[0:37:47-0:37:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:37:47):**  food for the soil life.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:37:49):**  That means in a coniferous forest the soil is much less active and you have a lot less  
**[0:37:57-0:38:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:37:57):**  bio-turbation like earthworms digging their holes in the ground and microorganisms being  
**[0:38:05-0:38:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:38:05):**  active and that's why you usually get thick layers of needles and very low humus contents.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:38:13):**  And that means the soil in a broadleaf forest is much more of a sponge than in a coniferous  
**[0:38:22-0:38:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:38:22):**  forest and that's why we get more water in.  
**[0:38:25-0:38:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:38:25):**  So yeah that's the basic idea behind it.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:38:32):**  But the third thing is to get a better groundwater recharge in the region we need to stop surface  
**[0:38:41-0:38:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:38:41):**  runoff.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:38:43):**  That's the most important thing.  
**[0:38:44-0:38:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:38:44):**  We don't have too little rain.  
**[0:38:48-0:38:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:38:48):**  We have enough rain in Bratengrupp.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:38:50):**  We have been having 500 millimeters of rain for centuries and it works.  
**[0:38:56-0:38:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:38:56):**  We had a forested landscape.  
**[0:38:59-0:39:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:38:59):**  It was a landscape very rich in water.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:39:02):**  Like 1200 years ago the Slavic tribes who settled here, they settled here because it  
**[0:39:09-0:39:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:39:09):**  was a country so rich in fish and wood.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:39:14):**  They came here to live here in peace and because it was a rich country.  
**[0:39:21-0:39:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:39:21):**  And so we don't have too little rain.  
**[0:39:27-0:39:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:39:27):**  We just need to use it differently because we drain the landscape.  
**[0:39:32-0:39:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:39:32):**  We put ditches everywhere to do plowing and farming in places where there were swamp lands,  
**[0:39:44-0:39:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:39:44):**  floodplains and bogs.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:39:46):**  And it's just yeah that was too much.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:39:50):**  We need to get back from these areas and let them be bogs again or floodplains.  
**[0:39:55-0:39:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:39:55):**  But that's only like one thing.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:39:57):**  That's like the lowest places in the landscape.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:40:00):**  And if the water comes there it's already too late.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:40:03):**  We need to stop water in the upper areas of a landscape.  
**[0:40:08-0:40:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:40:08):**  And that applies to a hilly landscape but also to a flatter landscape because we always  
**[0:40:14-0:40:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:40:14):**  have differences in the altitude and in the shape of the land.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:40:20):**  And that's where keyline design comes in.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:40:23):**  It's not applicable everywhere in flatter landscapes but it is astonishing in how much  
**[0:40:32-0:40:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:40:32):**  places it actually works.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:40:35):**  We have seen areas which have a slope of 2.5 percent in general.  
**[0:40:41-0:40:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:40:41):**  And if you apply keyline design you get a significant measurable plus in water to go  
**[0:40:49-0:40:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:40:49):**  into the soil.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:40:51):**  It also depends on the soil texture, the soil type and so on.  
**[0:40:56-0:40:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:40:56):**  But that's the third thing I wanted to talk about.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:40:59):**  If we want to restore groundwater and hydrology it's not done by looking at the rivers at  
**[0:41:06-0:41:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:41:06):**  the low points in the landscape and restoring them.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:41:09):**  We need to look at the highest places in the landscape and start there and say there's  
**[0:41:16-0:41:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:41:16):**  no surface runoff anymore.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:41:19):**  We won't lose any water.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:41:20):**  We will put all the water that's coming from above into the soil and that will go into  
**[0:41:25-0:41:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:41:25):**  the wells, into the rivers as well.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:41:27):**  We won't lose our rivers if we stop surface runoff.  
**[0:41:31-0:41:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:41:31):**  That's important to say because some people say hey if you put every water in the ground  
**[0:41:35-0:41:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:41:35):**  won't the rivers dry out?  
**[0:41:38-0:41:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:41:38):**  No they won't.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:41:39):**  They will be fed by the wells and they will have less severe flood events.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:41:44):**  They will have clearer water.  
**[0:41:47-0:41:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:41:47):**  That's why the fish populations can come back and the whole water bodies will get restored  
**[0:41:54-0:41:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:41:54):**  as well.  
**[0:41:55-0:42:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:41:55):**  But groundwater as well and groundwater is drinking water.  
**[0:42:00-0:42:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:42:00):**  So if we want to live here sustainably in this landscape we need to stop surface runoff  
**[0:42:04-0:42:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:42:04):**  and put the water back in the soil for plant production and drinking water production.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:42:10):**  So that's the three things I wanted to say to your last question.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:42:14):**  And now the question about the legal restrictions to implementing agroforestry.  
**[0:42:23-0:42:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:42:23):**  I think there are no legal restrictions that could actually be really in the way of implementing  
**[0:42:34-0:42:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:42:34):**  agroforestry.  
**[0:42:35-0:42:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:42:35):**  I've been doing agroforestry planning professionally for seven years now and which is a long time  
**[0:42:47-0:42:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:42:47):**  in the young agroforestry scene.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:42:50):**  It's not a long time in terms of how trees grow.  
**[0:42:54-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:42:54):**  Yeah but it's a very long time.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:43:01):**  And I've been doing agroforestry plantings on arable land over time without having a  
**[0:43:09-0:43:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:43:09):**  distinct grand scheme for agroforestry in Germany because we can improvise.  
**[0:43:17-0:43:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:43:17):**  We have a lot of perennial crop cultures that are legal in agriculture or that can get a  
**[0:43:29-0:43:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:43:29):**  grant.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:43:30):**  So you have perennial crops and you basically have, well in Germany it works like this.  
**[0:43:36-0:43:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:43:36):**  You have two types of grants.  
**[0:43:38-0:43:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:43:38):**  The first is you just get a grant per hectare farming that you do and that is according  
**[0:43:47-0:43:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:43:47):**  to what you grow.  
**[0:43:48-0:43:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:43:48):**  So every year you say of wheat and then there's a list of codes and it says okay wheat you  
**[0:43:57-0:44:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:43:57):**  get I don't know 300 euros per hectare wheat and because we want more corn in the region  
**[0:44:03-0:44:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:44:03):**  for example you get 350 euros for one hectare of corn.  
**[0:44:09-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:44:09):**  So these codes they change every four years and according to what policies and which is  
**[0:44:19-0:44:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:44:19):**  kind of a version of the times.  
**[0:44:21-0:44:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:44:21):**  You get money for the most ridiculous things and others say we need more of this.  
**[0:44:27-0:44:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:44:27):**  They get too little funding.  
**[0:44:30-0:44:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:44:30):**  Anyway so we have perennial crops in this code list as well.  
**[0:44:36-0:44:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:44:36):**  So because people want to run like for example an apple plantation or a walnut plantation  
**[0:44:42-0:44:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:44:42):**  or aronia berries or whatever and there's only like a very limited list of codes because  
**[0:44:51-0:44:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:44:51):**  the administration doesn't want to put up a perennial culture that you can do.  
**[0:44:57-0:45:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:44:57):**  So there's a code for all other perennial cultures and that's something that you use  
**[0:45:03-0:45:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:45:03):**  most of the time.  
**[0:45:05-0:45:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:45:05):**  If you do fancy agroforestry stuff with plantings you can always put it in this code of all  
**[0:45:13-0:45:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:45:13):**  other perennial cultures and then you get a normal funding for it.  
**[0:45:17-0:45:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:45:17):**  And the second is that farmers often get money for extra ecological services.  
**[0:45:27-0:45:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:45:27):**  So for example if and that's like dependent on the federal state of Germany you're in.  
**[0:45:34-0:45:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:45:34):**  In Bavaria there's a grand scheme for trees in the fields and that means you just get  
**[0:45:43-0:45:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:45:43):**  I don't know 8 euros 50 per tree in a field.  
**[0:45:48-0:45:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:45:48):**  And so you can get the basic grand scheme for growing wheat for example plus you get  
**[0:45:55-0:45:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:45:55):**  8 euros 50 for every tree that's in the field.  
**[0:45:58-0:46:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:45:58):**  So we don't need a distinct agroforestry grand scheme to do agroforestry.  
**[0:46:08-0:46:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:46:08):**  The important thing is that ecologically we want to have agroforestry.  
**[0:46:14-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:46:14):**  From the legal point of view it's okay to have a mixture of annual and perennial cultures.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:46:21):**  Then it's still agroforestry.  
**[0:46:22-0:46:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:46:22):**  But farmers usually don't get it.  
**[0:46:24-0:46:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:46:24):**  They say what we don't have a grand scheme for agroforestry how can we do agroforestry?  
**[0:46:28-0:46:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:46:28):**  And I'm like look you're doing agroforestry you have wheat here and apples here that's  
**[0:46:34-0:46:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:46:34):**  agroforestry.  
**[0:46:35-0:46:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:46:35):**  And it's just two grand codes so it works.  
**[0:46:39-0:46:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:46:39):**  Plus next year we will get an agroforestry grand scheme which will be ridiculous because  
**[0:46:46-0:46:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:46:46):**  it's just 60 euros per hectare where all annual cultures will be like 300, 400, 500 euros  
**[0:46:54-0:46:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:46:54):**  per hectare.  
**[0:46:55-0:46:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:46:55):**  So nobody will do it.  
**[0:46:58-0:47:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:46:58):**  That's really ridiculous but I think that's the important thing that agroforestry advisors  
**[0:47:05-0:47:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:47:05):**  and planners like me have to communicate with the farmers.  
**[0:47:09-0:47:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:47:09):**  Say look we are getting an agroforestry grand scheme but don't use it.  
**[0:47:16-0:47:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:47:16):**  To do it like we always did it that's more profitable and we can do nice things with  
**[0:47:20-0:47:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:47:20):**  it as well.  
**[0:47:22-0:47:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:47:22):**  There's just some drawbacks which relate to this mindset we have in policy.  
**[0:47:36-0:47:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:47:36):**  People tend to link nature conservation with climate change as well.  
**[0:47:43-0:47:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:47:43):**  It's like we have this huge climate problem now but people are still thinking in terms  
**[0:47:48-0:47:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:47:48):**  of conservative nature protection.  
**[0:47:51-0:47:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:47:51):**  And we're having the climate of southeastern Austria here as well already.  
**[0:47:58-0:48:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:47:58):**  Like in Brandenburg we have the climate they had in southeastern Austria, Hungary 30 years  
**[0:48:04-0:48:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:48:04):**  ago.  
**[0:48:05-0:48:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:48:05):**  The climate zones are shifting and in Brandenburg for example the thing that grows best, the  
**[0:48:12-0:48:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:48:12):**  tree that grows best is the false acacia, or bina, what's it called in English, black  
**[0:48:20-0:48:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:48:20):**  locust.  
**[0:48:21-0:48:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:48:21):**  Black locust, yep.  
**[0:48:22-0:48:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:48:22):**  And now last year the Green Party or whoever, I don't know, I don't want to blame anyone  
**[0:48:30-0:48:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:48:30):**  but some people with a conservationist mindset managed to ban black locust from agroforestry  
**[0:48:38-0:48:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:48:38):**  plantings and from short rotation plantings because they say it's a non-native species.  
**[0:48:46-0:48:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:48:46):**  And it's like it's the only thing that still grows here.  
**[0:48:50-0:48:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:48:50):**  Why should we ban it?  
**[0:48:53-0:48:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:48:53):**  It's ridiculous.  
**[0:48:55-0:48:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:48:55):**  It's a perfect bee tree.  
**[0:48:58-0:49:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:48:58):**  It has a lot of honey and it comes to a time where bees really need it.  
**[0:49:03-0:49:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:49:03):**  We have the biodiversity crisis.  
**[0:49:06-0:49:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:49:06):**  Bees and wild bees need a forage again.  
**[0:49:10-0:49:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:49:10):**  And it's the best wood we can have here.  
**[0:49:13-0:49:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:49:13):**  It's the most durable wood we can grow here.  
**[0:49:16-0:49:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:49:16):**  It grows fast.  
**[0:49:18-0:49:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:49:18):**  It's a nitrogen fixer.  
**[0:49:20-0:49:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:49:20):**  So why on earth do we ban it?  
**[0:49:24-0:49:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:49:24):**  It's ridiculous.  
**[0:49:25-0:49:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:49:25):**  It's got some of the highest BTUs for fuel wood as well.  
**[0:49:29-0:49:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:49:29):**  It never rots.  
**[0:49:30-0:49:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:49:30):**  Yeah.  
**[0:49:31-0:49:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:49:31):**  I've taken a real interest in this because the forestry commission in the national park  
**[0:49:36-0:49:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:49:36):**  where we're moving to has gone to great lengths to remove black locust from the riparian zones,  
**[0:49:44-0:49:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:49:44):**  the riverways, going to the effort of actually putting poison into the trunks because obviously  
**[0:49:52-0:49:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:49:52):**  if you just cut them down, they'll resprout.  
**[0:49:55-0:49:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:49:55):**  So yeah, this is an issue that's everywhere right now.  
**[0:49:58-0:50:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:49:58):**  And for some reason that particular tree, despite how hardy and useful and just incredible  
**[0:50:05-0:50:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:50:05):**  it is, has been chosen for being non-native.  
**[0:50:08-0:50:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:50:08):**  And I completely agree with this mindset of conservation that we need to get out of.  
**[0:50:14-0:50:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:50:14):**  Yeah.  
**[0:50:15-0:50:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:50:15):**  We can't afford that mindset.  
**[0:50:16-0:50:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:50:16):**  We need to start seeing humans as a part of nature.  
**[0:50:22-0:50:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:50:22):**  And we, well, in a very short time on this planet, like in 1000 years, we mixed everything  
**[0:50:29-0:50:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:50:29):**  up.  
**[0:50:31-0:50:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:50:31):**  But that's what we have today and we need to deal with it.  
**[0:50:34-0:50:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:50:34):**  And we can't get back to, I don't know, like pretending that there are no humans on this  
**[0:50:43-0:50:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:50:43):**  planet transporting seeds from A to B. That's what we do.  
**[0:50:47-0:50:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:50:47):**  That's what birds do.  
**[0:50:48-0:50:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:50:48):**  We're just doing it faster.  
**[0:50:50-0:50:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:50:50):**  And yes, there's shit happening.  
**[0:50:52-0:50:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:50:52):**  We have things like, I don't know, willow herbs spreading all over Scotland in 10 years  
**[0:50:59-0:51:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:50:59):**  and annoying the people.  
**[0:51:00-0:51:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:51:00):**  Or we have, I don't know, black locusts growing somewhere where it didn't grow before.  
**[0:51:06-0:51:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:51:06):**  But we also have potatoes and corn growing in Europe.  
**[0:51:10-0:51:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:51:10):**  And we have horses in Northern America.  
**[0:51:14-0:51:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:51:14):**  Yeah.  
**[0:51:15-0:51:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:51:15):**  Imagine, imagine the old Western movies without Native Americans riding horses.  
**[0:51:21-0:51:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:51:21):**  Where did they get them?  
**[0:51:22-0:51:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:51:22):**  They got them from the Spanish in the late 1400s.  
**[0:51:26-0:51:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:51:26):**  So yes, humans act as a vector.  
**[0:51:31-0:51:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:51:31):**  We're shifting things.  
**[0:51:34-0:51:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:51:34):**  And that's it.  
**[0:51:36-0:51:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:51:36):**  We need to deal with it.  
**[0:51:37-0:51:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry/#t=0:51:37):**  And in some places, it's also a good thing.

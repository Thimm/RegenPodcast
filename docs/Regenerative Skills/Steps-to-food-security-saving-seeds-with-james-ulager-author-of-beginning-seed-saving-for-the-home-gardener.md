**[0:05:49-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:05:49):**  so many?  
**[0:05:51-0:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:05:51):**  Yeah, well, thank you.  
**[0:05:55-0:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:05:55):**  So I grew up in western Pennsylvania outside Pittsburgh, and we honestly didn't do a lot  
**[0:06:05-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:06:05):**  of gardening growing up.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:06:07):**  My father had this family legends that he would tell about growing up kind of as a poor

**[0:06:24-0:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:06:24):**  So when I became a dollar and got some of my own space, I started to grow some of my  
**[0:06:31-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:06:31):**  own food with a lot of interest in figuring out how I could be as independent as possible.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:06:40):**  In my mind, that's an important word to dwell on there because I actually have long ago  
**[0:06:46-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:06:46):**  decided that none of us are as independent as maybe we'd like to be or think we can be,  
**[0:06:51-0:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:06:51):**  but acknowledging some of the interdependence and really thinking about how we can maybe  
**[0:06:59-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:06:59):**  take ownership of some things that we've kind of left to industry over the last century  
**[0:07:05-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:07:05):**  or so.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:07:08):**  So as we got a little bit more space, I started to think about what else could I do with my  
**[0:07:16-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:07:16):**  garden and I had this ongoing discussion with my father around why he grew onions from onion  
**[0:07:23-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:07:23):**  sets.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:07:24):**  I said, dad, what's the big deal?  
**[0:07:26-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:07:26):**  You know, you've got a little onion and you grow a big onion.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:07:29):**  I don't understand it.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:07:31):**  And the counterpoint was, well, somebody gives you a little seed and then you make a big  
**[0:07:38-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:07:38):**  onion.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:07:39):**  What's the difference?  
**[0:07:40-0:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:07:40):**  And like I have many times in my life, I said, gosh, my father's right.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:07:46):**  I'm not sure if I told him that yet to date because I got to keep him accountable there  
**[0:07:52-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:07:52):**  a little bit, but I guess now the cat's out of the bag, he's going to hear about it.  
**[0:07:56-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:07:56):**  Yeah, you got to be careful with that praise.  
**[0:07:57-0:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:07:57):**  You don't want it to get away from you.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:07:59):**  I know, right?  
**[0:08:00-0:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:08:00):**  So dad, you were right.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:08:01):**  If you're listening, you were right, dad, about so many things.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:08:07):**  So I thought, well, okay, what if you got a seed and then got an onion and then got  
**[0:08:12-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:08:12):**  a seed and then got another onion.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:08:16):**  Now that's, that's a little bit different.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:08:19):**  And then the other thing that I was noticing, I was part of a community garden and people  
**[0:08:25-0:08:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:08:25):**  would, you know, how, um, how people often do, they buy their seed packet and they mark  
**[0:08:29-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:08:29):**  the end of the row with that seed packet.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:08:31):**  So they know what they planted and you know, the, you know, some giant sunflower, et cetera,  
**[0:08:35-0:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:08:35):**  and at the end at the end of the seed row and there in that row would be giant sunflowers.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:08:41):**  And then year after year, I would notice in the, in the field around the, uh, around the,  
**[0:08:46-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:08:46):**  the garden.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:08:47):**  Well, there were tons and tons of giant sunflowers.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:08:51):**  So I thought, well, why are we, why are we making our annual offering to see it, to,  
**[0:08:57-0:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:08:57):**  uh, to the seed company?  
**[0:08:59-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:08:59):**  Um, why can't we just, you know, cut out the middleman there?  
**[0:09:03-0:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:09:03):**  Um, at the same time, um, I was learning a lot about gardening and I was, I had so many  
**[0:09:09-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:09:09):**  local heroes.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:09:10):**  I mean, Vermont's a wonderful place to learn about gardening, right?  
**[0:09:13-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:09:13):**  There are anybody you talk to will have an opinion, um, on how to do this or that.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:09:19):**  It was a lot of water cooler conversations with coworkers.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:09:23):**  Um, but what was interesting is how people who I revered greatly to grow whatever kind  
**[0:09:31-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:09:31):**  of beautiful tomato in our hard cold climate.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:09:36):**  Um, they, well, at seed saving, they would say that you got to know what you're doing  
**[0:09:40-0:09:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:09:40):**  there and people would often shy away from it.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:09:42):**  And it became, um, it became somewhat of a, a stone I wanted to uncover.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:09:49):**  I said, well, it can't be all that, that, uh, mysterious.  
**[0:09:53-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:09:53):**  Um, at the same time, I started going to, um, uh, the Maine organic farmer and gardener  
**[0:10:01-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:10:01):**  association.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:10:02):**  Many people, um, even internationally might be familiar with this.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:10:05):**  It's called the common ground fair.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:10:07):**  And um, this is a huge 10,000 people in rural Maine, uh, every fall come and, um, and it's,  
**[0:10:15-0:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:10:15):**  it's a wonderful vibe.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:10:16):**  It's a great place.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:10:17):**  And they offer, um, talks on how to do this or that in homesteading or small farming.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:10:23):**  And so I started going to the seed saving talk, um, and met, um, who's many ways, my  
**[0:10:28-0:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:10:28):**  mentor, his name's will Bonzell.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:10:30):**  He's written a lot about seed saving and et cetera.

**[0:10:37-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:10:37):**  made all sorts of mistakes and a few, a few small victories.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:10:43):**  And then one year I went and will, wasn't there.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:10:46):**  And I don't, I, to this day, I actually, I should ask him, but I don't know where he  
**[0:10:49-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:10:49):**  was that year, but I said, Oh my gosh, nobody's talking about seeds.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:10:53):**  Seed saving.

**[0:10:59-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:10:59):**  fair.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:11:00):**  And so the next year I put an application, I said, look, I, you know, I've been doing

**[0:11:05-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:11:05):**  It's going to be the very basics.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:11:07):**  I'm just going to share my experience.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:11:11):**  And um, and they said, well, sure.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:11:12):**  Yeah, we need somebody to talk about seeds saving.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:11:15):**  And um, and then I ran into will, will Kane next year.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:11:19):**  And he said, well, we got a team up, you'll talk about it beginning seed saving.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:11:23):**  And I'll talk about advanced seeds saving.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:11:25):**  And he and I have been doing that for a, I don't know, it seems like about a decade or  
**[0:11:29-0:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:11:29):**  so, so far.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:11:31):**  And um, I've learned a lot more in that time.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:11:34):**  And um, one person who I met at that fair, uh, asked me, well, had you ever thought about  
**[0:11:41-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:11:41):**  putting your thoughts down and uh, into a book?  
**[0:11:44-0:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:11:44):**  And I said, well, who would publish that?  
**[0:11:46-0:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:11:46):**  And she said, well, I would.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:11:47):**  Um, and that was from the, um, from new society publishers.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:11:52):**  And so we, we came up with a book and it's very, the goal to answer, I guess your second  
**[0:11:57-0:11:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:11:57):**  question of why would we write this?  
**[0:11:59-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:11:59):**  The goal and the purpose of the book is really to be very accessible.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:12:03):**  So it's not, there are, there are good manuals that are not this book for really how to save  
**[0:12:09-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:12:09):**  seed in a commercial way, in a way that ensures very high degrees of purity that really to  
**[0:12:19-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:12:19):**  avoid any sort of contamination.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:12:21):**  And those are all good things and they're things that home gardeners want to do.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:12:25):**  The problem is, is that when you're optimizing seed saving at a industrial scale or maybe  
**[0:12:33-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:12:33):**  even a small seed farm scale, there are some things you're not going to do that are permissible  
**[0:12:41-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:12:41):**  really in my opinion for the home gardeners, as long as they know what they're doing.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:12:46):**  Um, so you'll read and we can get more into the details, but that you should never save  
**[0:12:52-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:12:52):**  cabbage seeds unless you have, you know, 200 cabbage seeds because cabbage cabbages don't  
**[0:12:57-0:12:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:12:57):**  do well with small populations.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:12:59):**  The thing is though, maybe you're the only person with a certain rare type of cabbage  
**[0:13:03-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:13:03):**  seed.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:13:04):**  Um, in that case, even if you can save four cabbages, which by the way, that's, there's  
**[0:13:09-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:13:09):**  some real reasons why that's not a good idea, but four might be better than saving zero.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:13:15):**  Um, in what it does for saving biodiversity in our planet and et cetera.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:13:20):**  So what I really wanted to do was talk about what you could save on a very small scale  
**[0:13:24-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:13:24):**  because it's usually size scale.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:13:25):**  That's the problem with, with, uh, in the home garden and also talk about where you  
**[0:13:31-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:13:31):**  might be able to, um, do some things in the home garden that maybe farmers can't do, but  
**[0:13:38-0:13:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:13:38):**  we can leverage our home gardens to, to take advantage of some of the kind of smaller plots  
**[0:13:45-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:13:45):**  that we have that might overcome some of the weaknesses.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:13:48):**  So that's really what the book addresses and it's designed, it's not laid out in a way  
**[0:13:52-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:13:52):**  that that's botanical.  
**[0:13:55-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:13:55):**  It's really laid out by difficulty level to be honest.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:13:58):**  Um, and people at first people when they look at it, they might be, that might not seem  
**[0:14:03-0:14:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:14:03):**  logical, but it's really like if you've never done it before, just start with the first  
**[0:14:08-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:14:08):**  set of, um, the first chapter.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:14:11):**  And if you start there, then you know, the fourth chapter might be overwhelming, but  
**[0:14:15-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:14:15):**  if you, if you do it for a couple of years or even a year, um, the fourth chapter is  
**[0:14:20-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:14:20):**  going to seem like the logical next place to go.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:14:22):**  So that's how it's laid out.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:14:23):**  And that was kind of the logic behind it.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:14:25):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:14:26):**  I really liked that aspect of the book and how it kind of walks people through from beginning  
**[0:14:30-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:14:30):**  all the way up to an aspirational set.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:14:33):**  And you also said a lot of things there that, I mean, I'd love to highlight because they're  
**[0:14:37-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:14:37):**  so relevant to where we're at as a society globally right now, especially the one about  
**[0:14:44-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:14:44):**  resilience and independence and so many people looking around at the system that they rely  
**[0:14:51-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:14:51):**  on for food and for other necessities and seeing the cracks in it as it's been really  
**[0:14:57-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:14:57):**  challenged in this crisis situation.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:14:59):**  I mean, I'm sure you've heard about a lot of the seed suppliers and companies being  
**[0:15:04-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:15:04):**  completely sold out as people kind of rush to try and start their gardens and do all  
**[0:15:11-0:15:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:15:11):**  of these basic things for themselves.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:15:12):**  So we had just sort of ignored or taken for granted would get done for us by the economic  
**[0:15:18-0:15:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:15:18):**  global machine and realizing that if we don't start to reinvest in some of these basic skills  
**[0:15:24-0:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:15:24):**  and seed savings, certainly one of them, we could really find ourselves lacking when events  
**[0:15:31-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:15:31):**  like this occur.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:15:33):**  How have you seen kind of a response from the community that you're connected to reach  
**[0:15:38-0:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:15:38):**  out for this information and look to kind of, I guess, reestablish some independence  
**[0:15:44-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:15:44):**  and resilience in their own lives and processes?  
**[0:15:46-0:15:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:15:46):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:15:48):**  And that's a great question.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:15:49):**  And I think the first thing I would say that I've observed is a lot of our smaller and  
**[0:15:57-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:15:57):**  local seed companies have really stepped up and that's one of the places where that resiliency  
**[0:16:05-0:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:16:05):**  starts is, you know, there's big agribusiness, there's small people doing it themselves,  
**[0:16:15-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:16:15):**  and then there's small companies that are trying to do the right thing for their customers.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:16:22):**  And I have no relationship with these seed companies, but I've seen high mowing seed,  
**[0:16:25-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:16:25):**  for example, has done a great job trying to meet their customers' demand.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:16:35):**  As a matter of fact, I even saw that they, in the face of the current crisis, even were  
**[0:16:40-0:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:16:40):**  able to donate some seeds to our local organic farming association.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:16:45):**  So that's the strength and resiliency that I think some of those small companies bring  
**[0:16:50-0:16:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:16:50):**  us.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:16:51):**  So seeds is another one, they're based in Maine, they've really done a great job.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:16:57):**  The question about how to engage the community response is a really good one.

**[0:17:09-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:17:09):**  have had conversations with in the community in the past, or even I'll speak to myself,  
**[0:17:16-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:17:16):**  this is something I enjoy.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:17:17):**  I think it's important, but there's a whole new way that I think about it in a time of  
**[0:17:24-0:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:17:24):**  scarcity.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:17:26):**  So if we're interested in this before, and now this scarcity brings it to a whole new  
**[0:17:36-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:17:36):**  level, how do we take advantage of that?  
**[0:17:39-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:17:39):**  So I'm really interested in my own community in figuring out how to start talking to people  
**[0:17:49-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:17:49):**  about putting a few of those seeds by.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:17:51):**  There's some pretty easy things you could do, and this is a great time of year to talk  
**[0:17:54-0:17:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:17:54):**  about it, to make sure that say, hey, you know what?  
**[0:17:58-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:17:58):**  Don't pick that whole row of green beans, leave a couple plants at the end and let them  
**[0:18:01-0:18:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:18:01):**  go to seed when you're done, because you might really want those seeds next spring.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:18:08):**  So, I think getting the word out is, we really need to take advantage of that right now.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:18:14):**  Now though your book focuses on seed saving, and it's definitely kind of what we're going  
**[0:18:18-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:18:18):**  to highlight here, it certainly isn't the only way that plants reproduce.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:18:23):**  So let's first break down the most common ways to propagate plants to our listeners,  
**[0:18:28-0:18:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:18:28):**  so that they know what we're talking about if we mention some jargon and some new terms  
**[0:18:32-0:18:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:18:32):**  as we dive deeper into this chat.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:18:34):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:18:38):**  So the big divide is vegetative and sexual propagation.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:18:42):**  So vegetative propagation is really when you're taking some part of the plant to turn it into  
**[0:18:49-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:18:49):**  a new individual plant that will be genetically identical to the parent.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:18:57):**  So there's no exchange of genetic material and there's basically no sex.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:19:02):**  And so there's a lot of plants that do that.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:19:05):**  Public is a good example, potatoes are another one, we just plant new potatoes.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:19:10):**  Apples, you take an apple, a cutting of the tree you want.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:19:15):**  And sometimes it's confusing because these things largely bear seed as well, obviously  
**[0:19:20-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:19:20):**  apples bear seed.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:19:22):**  But if you plant a northern spy apple seed, so basically you're going to have northern  
**[0:19:31-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:19:31):**  spy be the mother of that apple, but you don't know who the father is.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:19:36):**  And so there'll be some genetics happening there, so you don't know what the offspring  
**[0:19:39-0:19:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:19:39):**  is going to be.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:19:40):**  However, if you graft a northern spy apple branch onto a root of a different tree, you're  
**[0:19:45-0:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:19:45):**  going to get northern spy genetics.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:19:47):**  So that's the idea, there's no exchange of genetic material.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:19:51):**  So that's vegetative propagation.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:19:54):**  And we could talk a little bit more about that if people are interested.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:19:57):**  I mean, the short story about vegetative propagation is the hardest thing about it is disease propagation.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:20:04):**  So with potatoes are the best example, right?  
**[0:20:10-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:20:10):**  If you plant your potatoes from last year, the chance that you're keeping some blight  
**[0:20:17-0:20:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:20:17):**  spores on those potatoes or a number of viruses that can collect on potatoes is very high.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:20:21):**  And when you buy seed potatoes, they test for those things.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:20:25):**  So that's the hardest thing about vegetative propagation.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:20:29):**  So most of the book and most seed saving activities directed towards sexual propagation and kind  
**[0:20:38-0:20:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:20:38):**  of some of the different aspects of what you need to know about your plants and their sexual  
**[0:20:45-0:20:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:20:45):**  behaviors and reproductive behaviors, if you will, that can help you save seed.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:20:52):**  Yeah, and it gets a little bit trickier too when you realize that a lot of plants reproduce  
**[0:20:57-0:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:20:57):**  through multiple methods.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:20:58):**  So like the garlic you mentioned, it does put out seed even though most people don't  
**[0:21:02-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:21:02):**  propagate it that way.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:21:03):**  Or for example, like the fig trees that are all over here in Spain, they put out tons  
**[0:21:10-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:21:10):**  of seed in their fruit, but you won't be able to get a tree from those seeds.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:21:13):**  They're not really viable.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:21:15):**  Whereas they continue to spread over when their branches get all heavy and touch the  
**[0:21:21-0:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:21:21):**  ground and then put out roots when those branches enter the ground and then they just kind of  
**[0:21:26-0:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:21:26):**  spread that way.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:21:27):**  I've even seen the whole groves of fig trees that all started from one central point.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:21:32):**  And so within that, let's, like you said, focus on the sexual production methods and  
**[0:21:39-0:21:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:21:39):**  start with the really easy stuff and talk about some of the common plants that you can  
**[0:21:44-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:21:44):**  just plant their seeds and more or less get the exact same plant that you are looking  
**[0:21:47-0:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:21:47):**  for.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:21:48):**  Yeah, sure.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:21:49):**  So these are the friendliest seeds for the home gardener.  
**[0:21:54-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:21:54):**  And it's really a class of plants that are what we call inbreeding.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:22:01):**  And before we get to the plants themselves, I think it's important to talk about inbreeding  
**[0:22:04-0:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:22:04):**  versus outbreeding.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:22:05):**  That's kind of a vocabulary term.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:22:08):**  I don't really use that in a very extensive way in the book, but I think it's important  
**[0:22:14-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:22:14):**  to understand the term and the concept.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:22:18):**  And I speak in human analogies because it's a lot, you know, people understand the human  
**[0:22:24-0:22:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:22:24):**  piece.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:22:25):**  So, you know, it's not necessarily for the bashful, but it's for a good reason because  
**[0:22:29-0:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:22:29):**  it helps us understand.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:22:32):**  So the easiest way starting with humans is to think of inbreeding versus outbreeding  
**[0:22:39-0:22:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:22:39):**  this way.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:22:40):**  Humans are out breeders.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:22:43):**  And what that means is we like a large genetic population for our offspring to do well.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:22:48):**  So the example I often give is if a dozen of us just got fed up with how things are  
**[0:22:55-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:22:55):**  and we went to a remote island and we started a colony and nobody came into that or out  
**[0:23:00-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:23:00):**  of that colony for hundreds of years, you know, and we started having children, our  
**[0:23:06-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:23:06):**  children would be fine.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:23:08):**  But at some point, our grandchildren and great grandchildren, there would be some problems  
**[0:23:11-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:23:11):**  with inbreeding, certain genetic, uncommon genetic conditions would start to emerge because

**[0:23:28-0:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:23:28):**  And obviously that's not good for humans.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:23:31):**  It turns out for plants, this is an okay thing in certain situations, not all of them.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:23:36):**  And those plants are good for the home garden because they can tolerate the small population  
**[0:23:42-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:23:42):**  of your home garden.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:23:44):**  As a matter of fact, some of those plants are even receptive to their own pollens.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:23:49):**  So they don't even have to bother with exchanging pollen from other individuals.  
**[0:23:54-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:23:54):**  They just accept their own pollen.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:23:57):**  So those are easy plants to propagate.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:24:01):**  So peas and beans are the classics.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:24:06):**  And lettuce is another really easy one.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:24:10):**  A lot of us who are trying to grow lettuce for food often grow seeds by mistake if it's  
**[0:24:14-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:24:14):**  hot and dry and we don't water our lettuce in time or if we have a busy week at work  
**[0:24:19-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:24:19):**  and especially as it gets hot.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:24:24):**  So that's the first time I saved lettuce seed was by accident.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:24:27):**  We went to Alaska for a couple weeks and came back and there was lettuce seed.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:24:31):**  So sometimes not saving seed is the challenge.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:24:37):**  Tomatoes are pretty easy as well.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:24:40):**  And then some of the selfers, selfers is maybe another name for inbreeding plants that will  
**[0:24:45-0:24:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:24:45):**  accept their own pollen.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:24:46):**  Some of them get a little trickier.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:24:47):**  Peppers are a good example.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:24:49):**  Peppers are a little bit more promiscuous, so to speak.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:24:53):**  They will accept their own pollen, but they can accept it from their neighbors as well.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:24:58):**  So that's a good bit of the things that are really easy to save at home.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:25:07):**  And so in a lot of these cases, it's as easy as just allowing them to bolt, so to speak,  
**[0:25:13-0:25:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:25:13):**  and put up the flowers that give the pollen and allow the exchange of genetic information  
**[0:25:18-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:25:18):**  either within themselves or within a narrow genetic pool around them.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:25:22):**  And then they start to put out seeds.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:25:24):**  And some of these look very different.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:25:27):**  But collecting them can be more difficult with some than with others.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:25:31):**  What's some advice on what to look out in characteristics and try to identify which  
**[0:25:36-0:25:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:25:36):**  part of the seed even to save because it's not always super clear?  
**[0:25:40-0:25:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:25:40):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:25:41):**  Well, so I mean, so the easiest is dry beans, right?  
**[0:25:45-0:25:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:25:45):**  If you have a black bean, that's your seed and you're done, right?  
**[0:25:50-0:25:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:25:50):**  It's the same thing that you eat.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:25:52):**  So that's very easy.  
**[0:25:55-0:26:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:25:55):**  Green beans are maybe like the next level up because you're eating the seed at an immature  
**[0:26:00-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:26:00):**  level.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:26:01):**  So you just have to get to the dry bean phase of those green beans.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:26:08):**  And that's honestly pretty easy for most of us.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:26:11):**  I challenge anybody to grow a row of green beans and to collect and eat every single  
**[0:26:16-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:26:16):**  one.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:26:18):**  So as I alluded, right, the gone bys are your friends in this case.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:26:23):**  So you plant a row of green beans, you eat them for a few weeks in the summer.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:26:29):**  And then it's time maybe for me, I put my fall carrots in right after my green beans.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:26:33):**  So I pull up that first planting, most of it, but I leave a few plants on the end.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:26:38):**  Green beans are fine with that.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:26:39):**  You don't need a big population.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:26:40):**  If you save seed from just a couple individuals, that's totally fine.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:26:45):**  And so peas are similar.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:26:47):**  Sugar snap peas, we just pick and pick and pick.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:26:50):**  And then eventually it's late summer and there's some other things we're interested in the  
**[0:26:53-0:26:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:26:53):**  garden.  
**[0:26:55-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:26:55):**  And we think we've picked them all and invariably we go back in the fall and you can shake the  
**[0:26:59-0:27:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:26:59):**  vines and you can hear the dry ones rattling and those are your seed.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:27:03):**  Now obviously things like lettuce, you eat in the juvenile stage, right?  
**[0:27:06-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:27:06):**  You really eat before it enters puberty, which we would call it in adult maturity.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:27:14):**  And so what you have to do is let it bolt.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:27:21):**  Now a note on learning from, for everybody to learn from my mistakes, you know, one of  
**[0:27:27-0:27:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:27:27):**  the first things I did early on as a seed saver was, you know, you plant 10 lettuce  
**[0:27:31-0:27:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:27:31):**  plants and one bolts.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:27:33):**  And I thought, well, that's good.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:27:35):**  I can't eat that one.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:27:36):**  I'll just use that one for seed.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:27:37):**  Turns out that's a bad idea because what you're selecting for is early bolting.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:27:41):**  So you know, right?  
**[0:27:43-0:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:27:43):**  So you have to be careful about what you're selecting for.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:27:47):**  But the lettuce plant will bolt and it'll have a number of flowers at the top that will  
**[0:27:54-0:27:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:27:54):**  end up turning like into little dandelion fuzz.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:27:58):**  And that's the one you collect.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:28:00):**  I think the other big thing with lettuce is that there are side shoots.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:28:05):**  They're called tillers.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:28:06):**  If you don't remember that, it's okay.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:28:07):**  They're just side shoots.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:28:10):**  But they mature at a different rate.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:28:12):**  And so you don't want to try and wait for all of those side shoots to be mature.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:28:15):**  You just want that center one too.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:28:17):**  And they'll be nice and dry and you can smash them in your hand and they just turn into  
**[0:28:21-0:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:28:21):**  dry fluffy seed.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:28:24):**  And that's when you want them.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:28:25):**  The biggest enemy of that is fall rain or late summer rain because it can all of a sudden  
**[0:28:31-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:28:31):**  you'll have a big rain and there'll be lots of lettuce babies around your mama plant.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:28:35):**  So that's a challenge.

**[0:28:42-0:28:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:28:42):**  is maturity, right?

**[0:28:52-0:28:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:28:52):**  Same thing with green beans, 75 days for eating, but maybe 110 for...

**[0:29:02-0:29:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:29:02):**  You might plant green beans in July.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:29:04):**  And I'm speaking in New England terms here for anybody who's listening.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:29:11):**  Adjust for your location.

**[0:29:17-0:29:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:29:17):**  I can get a beautiful food crop of green beans from, that's the wrong one to get a seed crop  
**[0:29:22-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:29:22):**  from.

**[0:29:28-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:29:28):**  the ways to store them to make sure that they last for as long as possible and you keep  
**[0:29:33-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:29:33):**  them clean and ensure better success when it comes time to plant.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:29:38):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:29:39):**  Oh, that's a great question.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:29:40):**  And even if you're not going to save seed and you're going to buy it, this is a great  
**[0:29:45-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:29:45):**  thing to make sure you know how to do because you often can only buy as much seed as you  
**[0:29:51-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:29:51):**  might use for three or four years.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:29:57):**  So storing it well can save you some money.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:30:00):**  The other reason it's important is that with certain biennials, kale is a very good example  
**[0:30:05-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:30:05):**  here.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:30:06):**  Kale is an outbreeder.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:30:09):**  So it likes a big population, but kind of like we talked about before, in certain circumstances,  
**[0:30:14-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:30:14):**  the first offspring from a smaller population is okay.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:30:19):**  So I've had a situation where I've saved kale seed from just a few individuals, say four  
**[0:30:24-0:30:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:30:24):**  or five.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:30:26):**  And in the long run, there will be what we call inbreeding depression.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:30:31):**  So they're not happy by sharing their genetic material amongst a few individuals.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:30:37):**  But that first year is fine.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:30:39):**  Well, it turns out if you save kale seed from four plants for one year, you get enough kale  
**[0:30:46-0:30:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:30:46):**  seed for the county.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:30:47):**  It's a lot of seed.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:30:49):**  I'm looking at mine right outside my window right now and it is loaded.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:30:53):**  Right, right.  
**[0:30:55-0:30:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:30:55):**  It's huge.  
**[0:30:56-0:31:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:30:56):**  So I've saved mason jars full of kale seed.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:31:02):**  And if you know how to store it well, then you're good for a decade maybe, depending  
**[0:31:08-0:31:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:31:08):**  on the size of your garden.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:31:10):**  The other thing you could do with that is sprout it, by the way.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:31:12):**  Microgreens in the winter.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:31:14):**  But back to your question about storage.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:31:18):**  So seeds by and large, you got to put them away dry and then they cool dry conditions.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:31:25):**  And I want to put some caveats around that.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:31:26):**  A lot of people will naturally say, well, oh good, so I'll put mine in a food dehydrator  
**[0:31:31-0:31:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:31:31):**  and I've had several questions about that at different points.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:31:34):**  And the thing you have to remember about your seeds is they are alive.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:31:37):**  So it's not like an herb that it's a cutting that's dead that you're going to just preserve.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:31:42):**  These are still alive.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:31:43):**  So they do need a certain amount of humidity within them to stay viable.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:31:50):**  They're just dormant, but they're still alive.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:31:53):**  So a food dehydrator is not a good idea.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:31:56):**  In New England, a great place to dry them is an October family room with a wood stove  
**[0:32:02-0:32:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:32:02):**  going because it's nice and dry.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:32:04):**  And that works really well.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:32:09):**  In the book, I give a pretty extensive example of how I dry things in our screen porch.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:32:14):**  So I hang them upside down in the screen porch, which is nice.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:32:17):**  It keeps them out of the rain, but there's still a breeze blowing through there.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:32:20):**  And that works really well hanging upside down.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:32:22):**  You have to be careful in those circumstances about sometimes they'll drop their seeds.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:32:29):**  Certain lettuce varieties will drop their seed, although some will hang on to it.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:32:33):**  So that's getting them in that dry place.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:32:34):**  I call it to know for certain things if they're dry enough, because if you put away seeds  
**[0:32:39-0:32:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:32:39):**  that aren't dry, they'll be moldy when you open them up.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:32:43):**  So with bigger seeds like beans, I call it the ping test.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:32:46):**  You get a nice metal bowl and you drop it in the bowl.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:32:48):**  If it pings, you're all good.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:32:50):**  You know, if it sounds like you dropped a pebble in there, you're okay.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:32:52):**  If it makes a dull thunk, you've got to dry them some more.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:32:58):**  But at that point, you put them in a cool, dry place.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:33:02):**  So we use a guest room, a closet, an unheated guest room that's probably through us in the  
**[0:33:09-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:33:09):**  winter is 55 or 60 degrees and dry and dark.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:33:13):**  And that works really well.

**[0:33:20-0:33:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:33:20):**  want to freeze them.

**[0:33:26-0:33:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:33:26):**  you know, if you take, I'll again use a Mason jar example.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:33:30):**  If you take that jar out of the freezer and open it up, there's really cold stuff in there  
**[0:33:34-0:33:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:33:34):**  that's going to condense moisture.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:33:35):**  So you either have to let it warm naturally or some people will seal them in little individual

**[0:33:49-0:33:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:33:49):**  I've had a number of questions, people asking questions about, well, the garage and or kind

**[0:34:01-0:34:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:34:01):**  I don't know what other people call it, but a room where, you know, kind of an anteroom  
**[0:34:05-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:34:05):**  coming into the house.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:34:07):**  And you just want to watch big temperature swings because a garage, for example, might  
**[0:34:12-0:34:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:34:12):**  be 20 degrees in the winter and you know, 85 in the summer and humid.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:34:19):**  So that's just something you have to watch.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:34:20):**  So I tend to be cautious about those conditions.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:34:23):**  A root cellar, many people ask about root cellars.  
**[0:34:26-0:34:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:34:26):**  A classic root cellar is too humid for seed storage.  
**[0:34:30-0:34:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:34:30):**  So a place where you would store potatoes and carrots is too humid.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:34:34):**  Our root cellar is not humid, but we, the way we deal with that for the food is that  
**[0:34:39-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:34:39):**  we put them in kind of sealed plastic bins and that works well for them.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:34:43):**  So I've never done it, but I think I probably could store seed in my, in my, in my root  
**[0:34:49-0:34:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:34:49):**  cellar.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:34:50):**  But most of the time, if you have a good root cellar, not like ours, but a good one, it  
**[0:34:55-0:34:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:34:55):**  will be too moist.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:34:58):**  So that's, those are some things to think about in storing seed.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:35:00):**  Some seed will store longer.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:35:02):**  Just another point that certain seeds will, will not be good even in the second year.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:35:10):**  So the classics are onions and parsnip.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:35:14):**  And then some seeds last forever.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:35:16):**  Corn and certain wheat and grain varieties lasts hundreds of years reportedly.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:35:24):**  And the, my, my mentor, my seed saving mentor, Will Bonsill, tells a great story about how  
**[0:35:33-0:35:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:35:33):**  he was looking for a certain variety of corn and, and he couldn't find it.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:35:38):**  And somebody found an ear under their bed or something.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:35:40):**  I'm sure I'm mutilating that story in some way, but the spirit of it is the same, is  
**[0:35:44-0:35:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:35:44):**  that there is this ancient ear of corn that he planted and got some viable seed from.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:35:48):**  So some things can last a long time.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:35:50):**  Beans, for example, last five years or more if they're stored well.  
**[0:35:55-0:35:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:35:55):**  And if you're not sure, what you just do is a germination test, right?  
**[0:35:57-0:36:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:35:57):**  So you get a little soil or even better, I don't like to waste good garden soil in February  
**[0:36:02-0:36:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:36:02):**  when I'm trying to figure this all out.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:36:03):**  So you just get a little bit of maybe newspaper and dampen it with some, some, some water  
**[0:36:11-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:36:11):**  and just keep it moist for a few days with 10 seeds say on there and you see who sprouts  
**[0:36:16-0:36:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:36:16):**  and who doesn't and then you'll know.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:36:18):**  That's a good way to know if you need to order more seed or not.  
**[0:36:20-0:36:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:36:20):**  Sure, sure.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:36:21):**  So tell me about some of the ways that you can improve seed germination from the ones  
**[0:36:25-0:36:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:36:25):**  that you've saved.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:36:26):**  Well, so proper storage is the big one, number one.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:36:32):**  The other thing is doing all the seed saving, right?  
**[0:36:36-0:36:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:36:36):**  So if you have, you know, you might get a lower germination.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:36:41):**  For example, if you have that smaller population of certain plants you haven't done well.  
**[0:36:48-0:36:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:36:48):**  Different plants will like different conditions for germination.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:36:51):**  So the conditions of germination in particular.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:36:54):**  So peppers are very notorious for liking it really warm.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:36:59):**  You know, they like it 80 degrees.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:37:02):**  Tomatoes are a little bit less than that and you know, cabbage crops, you know, will, will  
**[0:37:09-0:37:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:37:09):**  often do just fine coming up in coolish, coolish soil.  
**[0:37:13-0:37:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:37:13):**  So it's, it's really interesting to put a flat of like cabbage, onion, peppers and tomatoes,  
**[0:37:23-0:37:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:37:23):**  just a seed tray of each of those and put it in kind of a marginal, maybe a high 60s  
**[0:37:27-0:37:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:37:27):**  condition.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:37:28):**  And I do this every year because this is how I start my seeds indoors.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:37:32):**  And the peppers are kind of like I was when I was about 16 years old trying to wake up  
**[0:37:38-0:37:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:37:38):**  for school in the morning.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:37:39):**  They were reluctant and a little bit and the Chinese cabbages, they pop right up and they  
**[0:37:46-0:37:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:37:46):**  think it's spring.  
**[0:37:47-0:37:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:37:47):**  Hey, it's ready to go.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:37:48):**  What's, you know, let's do it.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:37:50):**  Anything other than freezing, really.  
**[0:37:51-0:37:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:37:51):**  Yeah, that's right.  
**[0:37:52-0:37:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:37:52):**  Right.  
**[0:37:53-0:37:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:37:53):**  They're fine with it.  
**[0:37:54-0:37:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:37:54):**  So it's really individual to the, to the, to the plant.  
**[0:37:58-0:37:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:37:58):**  Yeah.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:37:59):**  Okra was the other one that I really had trouble sprouting earlier than when the heat started  
**[0:38:03-0:38:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:38:03):**  to set in this year.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:38:05):**  And now it's doing really great.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:38:07):**  And I've left it outside for quite a while.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:38:09):**  They're starting to get big, but yeah, it's, it, it makes a big difference.  
**[0:38:12-0:38:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:38:12):**  The germination from the temperature that you, you plant them at and have you experimented  
**[0:38:19-0:38:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:38:19):**  much with a heated trays or, or heat mats below your trays?  
**[0:38:24-0:38:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:38:24):**  Yes, absolutely.  
**[0:38:25-0:38:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:38:25):**  I use heat mats for my, um, perpetrating for, for peppers and tomatoes.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:38:32):**  Um, the, um, and that works, that can work very well.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:38:36):**  The challenge is, um, it can also dry your soil a lot faster.  
**[0:38:41-0:38:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:38:41):**  So you just have to be diligent about making sure the soil moisture is, um, is consistent.  
**[0:38:48-0:38:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:38:48):**  So that's an important piece.  
**[0:38:49-0:38:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:38:49):**  All right.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:38:51):**  So now that we've got the basics, let's take the next step and talk about biennials and  
**[0:38:57-0:39:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:38:57):**  some of the other plants that maybe are a little bit more tricky the first time you  
**[0:39:00-0:39:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:39:00):**  try them.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:39:01):**  Yeah.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:39:02):**  Well, so biennial, so all, uh, all a biennial is, is, um, something that requires, and I'm

**[0:39:22-0:39:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:39:22):**  As a matter of fact, sometimes a mild winter's even better.

**[0:40:26-0:40:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:40:26):**  Um, and this is how I would recommend people growing parsley is that even now in the, in  
**[0:40:32-0:40:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:40:32):**  the summer, um, in New England, I have parsley growing, not in the ground, but in pots.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:40:38):**  Um, because I'll take a cutting of it as I need it here and there throughout the summer.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:40:42):**  And then I'll just bring it inside through the winter.  
**[0:40:45-0:40:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:40:45):**  And that inside experience in my house with cooler temperatures and less light will be

**[0:41:17-0:41:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:41:17):**  It doesn't have that many moving parts.

**[0:41:24-0:41:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:41:24):**  not with 500 other parsley plants, but just with one or two friends, um, that, that's

**[0:41:32-0:41:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:41:32):**  Um, and the parsley seed is actually very, um, very, uh, it's flavorful as well.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:41:38):**  You can grind up parsley seed and while we're on parsley, a less common plant that is a

**[0:41:49-0:41:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:41:49):**  save is cutting celery.

**[0:44:53-0:44:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:44:53):**  Where you get into more difficulties with biennials is, um, particularly when you have  
**[0:44:57-0:45:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:44:57):**  a hard winter like we do is when you have to store the root through the winter.  
**[0:45:01-0:45:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:45:01):**  So things like, uh, beets.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:45:03):**  Beets, you have to bring that root inside and keep it through the winter and then plant  
**[0:45:07-0:45:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:45:07):**  it out next spring without the spreen rotting.  
**[0:45:10-0:45:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:45:10):**  The spreen is that little place where the root meets the greens, right?  
**[0:45:13-0:45:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:45:13):**  That's the kind of the epicenter of the plant's life.  
**[0:45:17-0:45:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:45:17):**  And that's gotta, that's gotta be, uh, intact.  
**[0:45:20-0:45:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:45:20):**  Um, so that's, that, that's what can make, uh, biennials, um, a challenge.  
**[0:45:26-0:45:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:45:26):**  The other thing is garden space for home gardeners.  
**[0:45:28-0:45:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:45:28):**  Garden space makes biennials a challenge because, you know, a lot of us don't have a lot of  
**[0:45:33-0:45:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:45:33):**  space, so we don't necessarily want to commit all this room to growing it out.  
**[0:45:39-0:45:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:45:39):**  That being said though, um, if you, you can grow a food row of say beets, um, and just  
**[0:45:47-0:45:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:45:47):**  take a couple of roots and save them for seed.  
**[0:45:50-0:45:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:45:50):**  Um, and then the next year you'll need, you'll need a little bit of, um, you'll need a little  
**[0:45:55-0:45:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:45:55):**  bit of room to let them grow to their full height.  
**[0:45:57-0:46:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:45:57):**  But by and large you don't have to spend a whole year growing, you know, beets.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:46:02):**  You could just, it could be part of your food crop in that first year is what I'm saying.  
**[0:46:05-0:46:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:46:05):**  They don't need their special place.  
**[0:46:08-0:46:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:46:08):**  And so with, with biennials kind of covered and you know, one of the things that I'm noticing  
**[0:46:13-0:46:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:46:13):**  is you're talking about your winter specifically.  
**[0:46:16-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:46:16):**  Whereas like here I planted some beets back in November and they're actually all going  
**[0:46:21-0:46:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:46:21):**  to seed right now after I've gotten quite a good harvest out of them.  
**[0:46:25-0:46:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:46:25):**  I think for places that don't get such a harsh winter worrying about bringing them inside  
**[0:46:29-0:46:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:46:29):**  or having to, you know, give them special protection during the winter is much less  
**[0:46:34-0:46:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:46:34):**  of an issue as well.  
**[0:46:35-0:46:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:46:35):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:46:36):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:37-0:46:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:46:37):**  So, uh, all my neighbors, um, uh, if they could hear you speaking, they'd all be jealous.  
**[0:46:42-0:46:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:46:42):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:43-0:46:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:46:43):**  I've lived in those climates too.  
**[0:46:46-0:46:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:46:46):**  I, I there's challenges and benefits for both.  
**[0:46:50-0:46:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:46:50):**  See that's true.  
**[0:46:51-0:46:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:46:51):**  And so there are, um, you know, when you're growing something a little bit out of, um,  
**[0:46:56-0:47:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:46:56):**  and this isn't quite a seed saving example, but it's a point in example, nevertheless,  
**[0:47:00-0:47:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:47:00):**  um, we have a super hardy peach tree and we're too far North for any of the pests that really  
**[0:47:05-0:47:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:47:05):**  a sale peaches in, in earnest.  
**[0:47:07-0:47:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:47:07):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:08-0:47:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:47:08):**  Um, right.  
**[0:47:09-0:47:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:47:09):**  So, um, now that peach tree might only last a few years and die.  
**[0:47:13-0:47:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:47:13):**  Um, though it hasn't so far, but if you can there, it pays off to kind of both live within  
**[0:47:19-0:47:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:47:19):**  the climate you're given and accept it for what it is, but also to explore the boundaries  
**[0:47:24-0:47:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:47:24):**  of that.  
**[0:47:25-0:47:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:47:25):**  Sure.  
**[0:47:26-0:47:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:47:26):**  Because boundaries are changing too.  
**[0:47:28-0:47:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:47:28):**  Well, that's actually a very good point.  
**[0:47:30-0:47:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:47:30):**  The boundaries are changing.  
**[0:47:32-0:47:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:47:32):**  Um, but that's kind of, I think that's somewhat, um, I'm sidestepping into what I think though  
**[0:47:39-0:47:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:47:39):**  is a very important point in my book is that you'll read things about seed saving.  
**[0:47:45-0:47:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:47:45):**  And while they're going to be true, if you're reading them from a reliable source, you have  
**[0:47:51-0:47:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:47:51):**  to remember that by and large, the people who've written books about seed saving are  
**[0:47:57-0:48:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:47:57):**  doing it from a standpoint of what a seed company needs for purity and germination rate  
**[0:48:04-0:48:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:48:04):**  and true to type and those kinds of things and what the home gardener needs for those  
**[0:48:09-0:48:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:48:09):**  things aren't the same.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:48:11):**  So in terms of the concept of exploring the edges of what's possible, which is kind of  
**[0:48:20-0:48:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:48:20):**  the theme I'm picking up on here, it's really important that if you pick up like a textbook  
**[0:48:28-0:48:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:48:28):**  book about seed saving, it will say, for example, that for beans, that you need at least 12  
**[0:48:37-0:48:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:48:37):**  yards of space between them in order to ensure purity, right?  
**[0:48:41-0:48:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:48:41):**  You can't grow them right next to each other.  
**[0:48:42-0:48:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:48:42):**  It will cross pollinate.  
**[0:48:44-0:48:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:48:44):**  Now the truth is it's not like, um, there's a line somewhere where they cross pollinate  
**[0:48:51-0:48:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:48:51):**  here and don't cross pollinate there.  
**[0:48:53-0:48:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:48:53):**  This is a probability and statistics thing, right?  
**[0:48:58-0:49:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:48:58):**  So if you're a farmer growing a thousand acres of bean seed and there's a 1% chance that  
**[0:49:05-0:49:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:49:05):**  they'll cross pollinate, you have a lot more than a thousand individuals in your plant  
**[0:49:11-0:49:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:49:11):**  field.

**[0:49:15-0:49:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:49:15):**  If you only have 15 plants and maybe you're in a little suburban garden where you only  
**[0:49:21-0:49:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:49:21):**  have 12 yards in your whole garden and you totally can't separate, you could probably  
**[0:49:28-0:49:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:49:28):**  grow those beans next to each other year after year and they won't cross pollinate.  
**[0:49:33-0:49:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:49:33):**  So I've done just this same thing.  
**[0:49:37-0:49:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:49:37):**  So I grow black beans for burritos and et cetera.  
**[0:49:40-0:49:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:49:40):**  And then I grow this bean called Vermont cranberry.  
**[0:49:42-0:49:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:49:42):**  It's a little speckled, kind of a brown speckled bean with red maroon speckles on it.  
**[0:49:49-0:49:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:49:49):**  And I've grown them side by side for years.  
**[0:49:51-0:49:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:49:51):**  And for a long time, I was able, when I was speaking, able to say, look, I've never had  
**[0:49:54-0:49:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:49:54):**  a cross.  
**[0:49:57-0:50:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:49:57):**  And then one year I, darn it, I had a cross.  
**[0:50:01-0:50:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:50:01):**  And it was a beautiful bean.  
**[0:50:02-0:50:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:50:02):**  It was a gray bean instead of black.  
**[0:50:05-0:50:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:50:05):**  And instead of maroon speckles, it had black speckles over a kind of this gray background.  
**[0:50:11-0:50:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:50:11):**  And it was really pretty.

**[0:50:16-0:50:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:50:16):**  But what you need to do is say, you have to stop and then say, oh cool, I got something  
**[0:50:20-0:50:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:50:20):**  I didn't expect.  
**[0:50:24-0:50:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:50:24):**  And maybe if that bean was beautiful enough, I could have planted it and gotten more of  
**[0:50:29-0:50:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:50:29):**  those.  
**[0:50:32-0:50:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:50:32):**  So as it was, I liked it, but not quite as much as I liked the things I was going for.  
**[0:50:37-0:50:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:50:37):**  So it just went in the chili pot with everything else.  
**[0:50:39-0:50:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:50:39):**  That's the thing is like, your mistakes can still be totally useful and wonderful, even  
**[0:50:46-0:50:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:50:46):**  if it's not something that you're going to continue to do.  
**[0:50:49-0:50:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:50:49):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:50:50-0:50:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:50:50):**  And so, and to this day, I still grow those beans right next to each other.  
**[0:50:54-0:50:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:50:54):**  And I've had one cross in however many, 15 years or something.  
**[0:50:57-0:50:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:50:57):**  So you know, and I can tolerate that.  
**[0:50:59-0:51:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:50:59):**  It was just a couple plants, by the way.  
**[0:51:00-0:51:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:51:00):**  It wasn't the whole row, so no harm done.  
**[0:51:05-0:51:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:51:05):**  Probably the plants that are closest to each other, no?  
**[0:51:08-0:51:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:51:08):**  Yeah.  
**[0:51:09-0:51:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:51:09):**  And that's actually, that's true of Vermont cranberry beans tend to have a little bit  
**[0:51:14-0:51:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:51:14):**  of a viney habit.  
**[0:51:15-0:51:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:51:15):**  So even though they're bush beans, they'll kind of start to spill over to the other places.  
**[0:51:19-0:51:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:51:19):**  So that's a danger all the time.  
**[0:51:23-0:51:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:51:23):**  But you know, if you don't push those boundaries.  
**[0:51:27-0:51:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:51:27):**  So if I never push those boundaries, to this day, I wouldn't be saving seed because when  
**[0:51:33-0:51:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:51:33):**  that happened, I would have just stopped and that would be silly.  
**[0:51:36-0:51:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:51:36):**  Now, there's an important caveat here.  
**[0:51:39-0:51:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:51:39):**  If I had, you know, my great grandfather was a Native American who gave me his special

**[0:51:53-0:51:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:51:53):**  be isolating that bean.  
**[0:51:55-0:51:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:51:55):**  Sure.  
**[0:51:56-0:51:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:51:56):**  That's a different circumstance though, yeah.  
**[0:51:59-0:52:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:51:59):**  Right.  
**[0:52:00-0:52:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:52:00):**  So you have to leverage your circumstances so we can decide what we can tolerate as home  
**[0:52:04-0:52:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:52:04):**  gardeners.  
**[0:52:05-0:52:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:52:05):**  So you just have to, you just have to keep that in mind.  
**[0:52:09-0:52:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:52:09):**  Yeah.  
**[0:52:10-0:52:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:52:10):**  There's so much more room for experimentation and you know, happy accidents, so to speak,  
**[0:52:15-0:52:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:52:15):**  when you're doing it for fun and for your own use rather than if you're trying to breed  
**[0:52:19-0:52:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:52:19):**  for, you know, for market or for a farming context.  
**[0:52:24-0:52:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:52:24):**  Well, absolutely.  
**[0:52:25-0:52:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:52:25):**  And that's this, when you're saving seed, it just gives you one more way of interacting  
**[0:52:30-0:52:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:52:30):**  with your garden because by and large, okay, what do we do to make our gardens grow well?  
**[0:52:34-0:52:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:52:34):**  We, you know, we add compost, we weed, we think about spacing, timing of, timing of  
**[0:52:42-0:52:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:52:42):**  planning, et cetera.  
**[0:52:43-0:52:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:52:43):**  We look at pests, hopefully, you know, we're not using chemicals and whatnot, but, and  
**[0:52:47-0:52:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:52:47):**  then in the end, we get what we get.  
**[0:52:50-0:52:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:52:50):**  Well, if you can start selecting and say, hey, some of these matured a little earlier  
**[0:52:55-0:52:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:52:55):**  in my short climate, maybe I should grow some more of those.  
**[0:52:58-0:53:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:52:58):**  And you do have to be careful because then you're not really seed saving anymore.  
**[0:53:01-0:53:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:53:01):**  You're selecting, you're, you're breeding a little bit.  
**[0:53:04-0:53:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:53:04):**  But again, as long as you're saving them for yourself or your friends and you told them  
**[0:53:08-0:53:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:53:08):**  what you did, then that's just a whole nother kind of way of interacting with your garden  
**[0:53:14-0:53:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:53:14):**  beyond the soil.  
**[0:53:15-0:53:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:53:15):**  And it's really making the garden your, your baby almost literally, right?  
**[0:53:19-0:53:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:53:19):**  Cause you're thinking about what those, what you're planning and what's, what's, how it's  
**[0:53:24-0:53:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:53:24):**  going to come up.  
**[0:53:25-0:53:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:53:25):**  And it's really a beautiful way of, of interacting with your garden beyond just the soil and  
**[0:53:29-0:53:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:53:29):**  the pests and all that.  
**[0:53:31-0:53:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:53:31):**  Well, to explore that a little more, and this is a personal question for me because it's  
**[0:53:34-0:53:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:53:34):**  something that I've struggled with in the past.  
**[0:53:37-0:53:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:53:37):**  Let's explore some of the other plants that can frustrate beginning seed savers, plants  
**[0:53:41-0:53:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:53:41):**  like, in my case, squashes that are harder to breed true from seed.  
**[0:53:46-0:53:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:53:46):**  And what are the ways that you can do that?  
**[0:53:48-0:53:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:53:48):**  Yeah, well, squashes, so it's important to know with squashes that there's actually five  
**[0:53:57-0:54:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:53:57):**  different varieties of squat.  
**[0:54:01-0:54:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:54:01):**  Well, variety is the wrong word here.  
**[0:54:02-0:54:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:54:02):**  We didn't do some of the vocabulary.  
**[0:54:04-0:54:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:54:04):**  So let me go back to that.  
**[0:54:06-0:54:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:54:06):**  A species, a species by and large is anything that can reproduce with another member of  
**[0:54:15-0:54:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:54:15):**  that same species and produce fertile offspring.  
**[0:54:19-0:54:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:54:19):**  Don't take that to your biology professor, but that's a pretty good for us.  
**[0:54:22-0:54:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:54:22):**  That's a good working definition.  
**[0:54:25-0:54:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:54:25):**  So there are roughly five different species of squash.  
**[0:54:32-0:54:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:54:32):**  I'm only going to be able to speak with authority about three of them because those are the  
**[0:54:36-0:54:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:54:36):**  only three that grow in my climate.  
**[0:54:38-0:54:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:54:38):**  So we'll just dwell on those three, certainly in Spain, the others will grow.  
**[0:54:43-0:54:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:54:43):**  But so these are all concurbits.  
**[0:54:47-0:54:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:54:47):**  There's the maxima species.  
**[0:54:49-0:54:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:54:49):**  So those tend to be pumpkins and things like Hubbard squash.  
**[0:54:57-0:55:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:54:57):**  There's the pepo, which tend to be summer squashes and some smaller pumpkins.  
**[0:55:03-0:55:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:55:03):**  So zucchini, the yellow crookneck squash, and then some of the smaller like New England  
**[0:55:09-0:55:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:55:09):**  pie pumpkins, a common pie pumpkin, that's the pepo.  
**[0:55:14-0:55:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:55:14):**  And then there's mashada, which is a butternuts.  
**[0:55:18-0:55:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:55:18):**  And so if you're growing and let's pretend for a second, I'm fortunate here in this respect  
**[0:55:23-0:55:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:55:23):**  because where I am, my neighbor's gardens are pretty far away.  
**[0:55:27-0:55:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/steps-to-food-security-saving-seeds-with-james-ulager-author-of-beginning-seed-saving-for-the-home-gardener/#t=0:55:27):**  So for practical purposes, let's just pretend like you don't have nearby neighbors with

### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 08 May 2020 08:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:00:09):**  You're in the right place for all things regenerative living, ecological restoration,  
**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:00:14):**  permaculture and natural building.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:00:16):**  I'm your host Oliver Gaucher.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:00:18):**  In this show, it's my job to interview leaders, innovators and rebels on the cutting edge  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:00:22):**  of their fields as we look for solutions to our generation's most urgent challenges  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:00:27):**  and share these techniques and information so that you can join us in creating a healthy  
**[0:00:31-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:00:31):**  and abundant world for everyone.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:00:33):**  So let's get started.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:00:40):**  No matter where in the world you live right now or how this COVID-19 pandemic has affected  
**[0:00:45-0:00:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:00:45):**  you, chances are you're re-evaluating many things in your life, especially concerning  
**[0:00:49-0:00:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:00:49):**  the resilience of your lifestyle in the face of changes outside of your control.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:00:53):**  And I'm right there with you.  
**[0:00:55-0:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:00:55):**  But I've been doing exactly this kind of analysis of resilience and ecological impact  
**[0:00:59-0:01:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:00:59):**  for clients for many years.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:01:01):**  So that's why I've put together a new resource to help people like you who want to start  
**[0:01:05-0:01:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:01:05):**  taking steps towards self-sufficiency right now.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:01:08):**  If you're interested in starting to produce your own food, cut costs while maintaining  
**[0:01:12-0:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:01:12):**  your health and livelihood, and reconnect with your community to increase your support  
**[0:01:16-0:01:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:01:16):**  network, then my new book Homesteading for Every Home was written just for you.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:01:21):**  This book will guide you through simple steps that you can take from any living environment  
**[0:01:25-0:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:01:25):**  to build resilience in your life and community by taking stock of what you already have to  
**[0:01:29-0:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:01:29):**  work with, and to leverage it for greater abundance in an uncertain future.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:01:34):**  Because of how important I believe this information is, I've made it free to download for a  
**[0:01:38-0:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:01:38):**  limited time.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:01:39):**  So go to the Education tab at AbundantEdge.com to download your copy today and start taking  
**[0:01:44-0:01:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:01:44):**  important steps towards a regenerative lifestyle, even in the face of a post-pandemic economy.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:01:50):**  The more people in communities that work together to create ecological abundance and resilient  
**[0:01:54-0:01:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:01:54):**  local economies, the better chance we have to create a new normal that includes the health  
**[0:01:59-0:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:01:59):**  and well-being of all life.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:02:04):**  Welcome back everyone to this ongoing series on regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:02:09):**  Last week we kicked off with an interview with Joel Salatin, and in this session I've  
**[0:02:12-0:02:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:02:12):**  got another great interview with one of the most influential Regen Ag practitioners in  
**[0:02:17-0:02:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:02:17):**  Europe.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:02:18):**  There's a lot of inspiring voices in the regenerative agriculture community, but few  
**[0:02:22-0:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:02:22):**  have done such a thorough job of documenting and publishing every step of the development  
**[0:02:28-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:02:28):**  of a small profitable farm the way Richard Perkins has done with Rydgdale Permaculture.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:02:34):**  Especially now that I've decided to put down roots in Europe, I've been looking for  
**[0:02:37-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:02:37):**  examples of profitable small farming models for inspiration for my own project here.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:02:42):**  And between Richard's YouTube channel and two books, Making Small Farms Work, and the  
**[0:02:47-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:02:47):**  new volume titled Regenerative Agriculture, there are few better resources to guide you  
**[0:02:51-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:02:51):**  step by step through all the design considerations from landscape analysis, business planning,  
**[0:02:58-0:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:02:58):**  crunching numbers, and creative paths to market.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:03:01):**  Though I spoke to Richard for the first time back in season 1, I invited him back for this  
**[0:03:06-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:03:06):**  episode to talk about some of the massive changes that are coming about from the COVID  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:03:10):**  health crisis, and how he's seen it affect small farms around Europe.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:03:15):**  We explore topics like farm enterprise analysis, suggestions for direct to consumer marketing  
**[0:03:20-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:03:20):**  and collaboration, and Richard also talks about his observations over the years of transformation  
**[0:03:26-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:03:26):**  of his small farm in northern Sweden, not only from a land health perspective, but also  
**[0:03:31-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:03:31):**  things that he's noticed about his teaching and mentorship strategy, as well as the characteristics  
**[0:03:36-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:03:36):**  he thinks are essential for succeeding in farming.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:03:39):**  This interview became a lot more philosophical than our first session, and for those of you  
**[0:03:44-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:03:44):**  who are hoping to hear Richard's backstory and description of his farm and business strategy,  
**[0:03:48-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:03:48):**  I've linked to our first interview in the show notes on the website, or you can find  
**[0:03:52-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:03:52):**  them by searching for Richard Perkins on the search bar at the top.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:03:56):**  Now I also want to say a sincere thank you to all of you wonderful listeners who have  
**[0:04:00-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:04:00):**  reached out to check up on me during this difficult time of lockdowns and social distancing.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:04:05):**  I'm very grateful and fortunate to say that my partner and I are healthy and safe, and  
**[0:04:09-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:04:09):**  that we're finally able to get out of the house a bit as Spain has begun to ease restrictions  
**[0:04:13-0:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:04:13):**  on the lockdown in a gradual transition back to a new normal.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:04:18):**  I hope this message finds all of you listening out there healthy and safe as well.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:04:22):**  And now I'll hand things over to Richard.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:04:25):**  Hey, welcome back, Richard.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:04:27):**  It's such a pleasure to be talking with you again.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:04:28):**  How are you doing?  
**[0:04:29-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:04:29):**  Great.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:04:30):**  Thanks, Oliver.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:04:31):**  Yeah, it's good to be back on here and spend some time talking with you, Sanja.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:04:35):**  Well, yeah, well, this is wild times that we're living in right now with the coronavirus  
**[0:04:39-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:04:39):**  lockdown and just the way that it's affecting the whole globe.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:04:42):**  It's a unique opportunity to explore some new topics here.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:04:46):**  And tell me a little bit about how things are going at the farm with these new developments  
**[0:04:49-0:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:04:49):**  for you.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:04:50):**  Well, it's, we're actually in the process of still really taking it in because this  
**[0:04:56-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:04:56):**  is the time when our, like the first of April is actually when our team typically arrive.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:05:02):**  We've actually got three of the team here now, and there's another girl coming in a  
**[0:05:08-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:05:08):**  couple of weeks.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:05:09):**  If the travel bans on, you know, on progressing any further.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:05:14):**  But we've been going through all kinds of processes to be honest.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:05:17):**  First of all, a couple of weeks ago, we were all really sick and it was quite a long sickness.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:05:24):**  And I, you know, in the current state of things, we were questioning what we had.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:05:28):**  My partner had the stereotypical symptoms and I had more just like really bad flu symptoms,  
**[0:05:37-0:05:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:05:37):**  that we started sort of second guessing.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:05:39):**  But here in Sweden, it's the government has both been criticized and praised for its approach.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:05:46):**  And I think more in the world stage, more critical response actually, because business  
**[0:05:53-0:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:05:53):**  is open as normal.  
**[0:05:55-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:05:55):**  Now I do get the sense people are sort of keeping their distance from each other, but  
**[0:06:00-0:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:06:00):**  Sweden's not exactly a touchy feely place anyway.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:06:05):**  But I did get the sense when I've been to town, like people are spending, you know,  
**[0:06:11-0:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:06:11):**  they're staying away from each other more so than normal.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:06:16):**  And so we've been going through a process of what's the best approach for us to take  
**[0:06:22-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:06:22):**  because we're not fully trusting the government's response, which is, you know, basically we  
**[0:06:28-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:06:28):**  trust our citizens to be healthy and do what's needed to avoid the spread, which would seem  
**[0:06:35-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:06:35):**  quite lackadaisical in relation to most other countries in the world.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:06:41):**  But the death toll and infection rate is very low here, but they haven't been testing.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:06:47):**  So it's, you know, it wouldn't be any surprise if the infection rate is much higher.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:06:53):**  So we've been going through a big process of deciding whether to keep us at home from  
**[0:06:58-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:06:58):**  daycare because we basically analyzed the situation when the first crew member arrived.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:07:05):**  And bearing in mind for listeners further afield, like Europe's in, like each country  
**[0:07:09-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:07:09):**  is taking its own course and it's still possible to travel within certain countries in Europe  
**[0:07:18-0:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:07:18):**  and for certain countries it's not possible at this time.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:07:22):**  So we've had to, yeah, so we've had to select, it led us to take a last minute decision in  
**[0:07:31-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:07:31):**  the choice of team.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:07:32):**  And that's really been down to Johanna this year.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:07:35):**  I would normally be very much involved in that process, but I was meant to be away this  
**[0:07:40-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:07:40):**  summer, so I felt it was much more important for Johanna to go through that selection process.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:07:45):**  But a big part of that was choosing people from places that would be useful to get here.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:07:53):**  So we basically closed down all applications for people outside of Europe because it just  
**[0:07:58-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:07:58):**  felt too risky for someone to come from Australia or Brazil and be stuck here for an indefinite  
**[0:08:05-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:08:05):**  amount of time.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:08:06):**  Of course, yeah.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:08:07):**  So that affected us already, but then, you know, I follow the UK news a lot being from  
**[0:08:15-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:08:15):**  there and just seeing what's going on globally, we decided, okay, so the biggest risk factor  
**[0:08:22-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:08:22):**  we have is actually our son going to daycare and potentially bringing something back because  
**[0:08:27-0:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:08:27):**  we're in a unique position where we can totally self isolate ourselves.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:08:32):**  We have a whole human diet on the farm and once the team's here, we're living quite in  
**[0:08:40-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:08:40):**  a bubble with farming every day.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:08:42):**  So the only, the weakest point for us in the coronavirus context would be our son going  
**[0:08:48-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:08:48):**  to daycare and then the way we sell.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:08:51):**  But I can talk a bit more about that because we've already put measures in place anticipating  
**[0:08:57-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:08:57):**  things getting worse.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:08:58):**  Well, let's get to the marketing part of the minute.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:09:02):**  Sure.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:09:03):**  I want to hear a little bit about, you know, with the regenerative agricultural model that  
**[0:09:07-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:09:07):**  you've promoted and that you've really exemplified on your farm, let's talk a little bit about  
**[0:09:12-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:09:12):**  the resiliency of the kind of diverse business model that you've pioneered and how regenerative  
**[0:09:18-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:09:18):**  agriculture strategies help to build resilience on the business side as well as through enhanced  
**[0:09:24-0:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:09:24):**  ecosystem services as this is a really important time to be looking at that through all business  
**[0:09:30-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:09:30):**  lenses.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:09:31):**  Yeah, well just going back one step first, I think like the biggest decision that impacts  
**[0:09:38-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:09:38):**  our daily life is the decision to keep our son at home and he's only three.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:09:44):**  So it takes like right now, Johanna and I are working two hour shifts alternately and  
**[0:09:51-0:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:09:51):**  it's no big deal and obviously a lot more people are in a lot more pressing situations  
**[0:09:58-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:09:58):**  but it has quite a massive impact on the running of the farm because this is the time of year  
**[0:10:04-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:10:04):**  when the most activity is going on to start up the season and we're typically running  
**[0:10:09-0:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:10:09):**  flat out and training people that haven't been on the farm before.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:10:14):**  So it's an interesting thing and it plays into that question of resiliency because we're  
**[0:10:21-0:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:10:21):**  pretty stretched at this time of year that it's definitely affecting our time.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:10:27):**  So we've changed our daily schedule so that we sleep very early and wake up even earlier  
**[0:10:34-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:10:34):**  than we typically do to be able to deal with admin and things like that that we would typically  
**[0:10:39-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:10:39):**  have a little time in the morning before we get into the work day outside when our son  
**[0:10:45-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:10:45):**  will be at daycare.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:10:47):**  So it's obviously going to impact a lot of people with their kids at home and we only  
**[0:10:52-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:10:52):**  have one child so I imagine people with larger families that are also trying to run the farm  
**[0:10:57-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:10:57):**  are going to find that challenging just to fit in things around the day.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:11:04):**  And it's also a blessing in disguise in that there's nothing more wonderful than having  
**[0:11:10-0:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:11:10):**  this son on the farm and including him in the processes but it really does impact time  
**[0:11:16-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:11:16):**  which is a big thing.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:11:18):**  But then more addressing your question directly I think, well there's many angles we can look  
**[0:11:26-0:11:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:11:26):**  at that from but it's definitely helpful, it's hard at this point to predict how things  
**[0:11:34-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:11:34):**  will go throughout the summer.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:11:37):**  But one of the immediate benefits I see in a diverse product portfolio is that we have  
**[0:11:43-0:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:11:43):**  a lot of products that can be stored.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:11:47):**  So frozen meats that we can put a year on their best before that gives you a lot of  
**[0:11:53-0:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:11:53):**  flexibility.  
**[0:11:55-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:11:55):**  And like right now it seems like there's an increased demand for local food but it's not  
**[0:12:01-0:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:12:01):**  clear to me or obvious to me how it will go selling fresh produce.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:12:06):**  You know there could be draconian regulations coming down the line that will impact market  
**[0:12:12-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:12:12):**  gardeners for example in ways that are unprecedented.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:12:15):**  We just don't know.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:12:17):**  So having storable products definitely feels useful.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:12:21):**  But also I think there's something about a diverse product portfolio that means, like  
**[0:12:30-0:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:12:30):**  something we've always seen at the farm is having eggs helps you sell vegetables.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:12:36):**  And having chickens helps you sell eggs and you know having complementary products and  
**[0:12:42-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:12:42):**  having a broad portfolio brings you customers.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:12:47):**  Like at the Rico rings that we sell at we're always consistently by far the busiest and  
**[0:12:53-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:12:53):**  I would say it's because we have a whole range of products.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:12:57):**  Most people are selling just vegetables or just lamb or whatever but we're selling all  
**[0:13:04-0:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:13:04):**  different types of meats and eggs and vegetables and it's very convenient for someone to be  
**[0:13:11-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:13:11):**  able to pick up a whole bunch of their shopping in one go.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:13:15):**  Now Rico as a whole is a very convenient model because you have a baker, a dairy person,  
**[0:13:21-0:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:13:21):**  meat producers, egg producers, veg producers so it's convenient to a customer that can  
**[0:13:26-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:13:26):**  pick up you know a large proportion of their food there.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:13:31):**  But we see the knock on effect of that through our farm sales in particular.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:13:36):**  So I think there's something generally to be said for having a diverse product portfolio  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:13:41):**  and in that adage that I think we even talked about last time I was on here, that saying  
**[0:13:46-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:13:46):**  Joel Salatin says if it's much easier to find a hundred customers that will spend a thousand  
**[0:13:51-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:13:51):**  euros with you than finding a thousand that will spend a hundred euros with you.  
**[0:13:55-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:13:55):**  And that's very very true.  
**[0:13:56-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:13:56):**  It's a good gem of wisdom yeah.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:13:58):**  It applies to so many things.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:14:02):**  It's very true in our experience so I think that's a good strategy at all times but certainly  
**[0:14:09-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:14:09):**  it's something to consider even for people only producing single items or like single  
**[0:14:17-0:14:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:14:17):**  types of products.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:14:18):**  This is a great time to consider online sales, delivery service and collaborations with other  
**[0:14:25-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:14:25):**  farmers to be able to supply you know one's weekly shopping in one drop to minimize contact  
**[0:14:33-0:14:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:14:33):**  time etc.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:14:35):**  So even if people are farming one particular product there's still a way to get the benefit  
**[0:14:40-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:14:40):**  of that diversity by collaborating and I think we're going to see a lot more of that happening.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:14:45):**  And that's beneficial on so many other levels because of efficiency and you know imagine  
**[0:14:51-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:14:51):**  you are collaborating with four different types of producers and you are running the  
**[0:14:56-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:14:56):**  Ricoh rings like we run you would only have to go once a month.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:14:59):**  I mean it would be perfect.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:15:02):**  Yeah no I mean this turns out to be quite an ideal circumstance given the restrictions  
**[0:15:07-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:15:07):**  that are being implemented in a lot of places and even when there aren't restrictions in  
**[0:15:11-0:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:15:11):**  place just people's tendency to want to avoid the situation different marketing models like  
**[0:15:16-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:15:16):**  the Ricoh rings and I've heard other people adapting their sales strategy perhaps if they  
**[0:15:21-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:15:21):**  were selling mostly directly to restaurants which in many cases have shut down starting  
**[0:15:27-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:15:27):**  to offer delivery services or drive-through pickups from their locations and have you  
**[0:15:32-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:15:32):**  started to consider any other marketing strategies in the face of these big changes or are you  
**[0:15:38-0:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:15:38):**  still kind of doubling down on this one that seems to be very well adapted to the situation?  
**[0:15:45-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:15:45):**  Well there's two angles on that and well firstly quite early on I noticed my friend Mikkel  
**[0:15:52-0:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:15:52):**  who's running eggs and micro dairy over in Denmark and I know that nearly all his sales  
**[0:16:01-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:16:01):**  are wholesale to restaurants in Copenhagen so I immediately felt concerned for him when  
**[0:16:07-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:16:07):**  they were shutting down over there because I knew that that would be very challenging  
**[0:16:12-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:16:12):**  times and I think he had I don't know 50,000 eggs backing up and he just didn't know what  
**[0:16:19-0:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:16:19):**  to do but they very quickly switched the selling strategy to private people and like a drive-through  
**[0:16:28-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:16:28):**  a farm drive-through where there's no contact at all pre-sold and people pick it up and  
**[0:16:33-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:16:33):**  they don't even have any face-to-face contact and it appears to be going extremely well  
**[0:16:38-0:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:16:38):**  I think a lot of people I've seen across in America a lot of people are seeing huge increases  
**[0:16:45-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:16:45):**  in sales and it's really there's going to be some knock-on effects long term from that  
**[0:16:52-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:16:52):**  which is great but we haven't actually had to do that we do sell to restaurants but it  
**[0:16:58-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:16:58):**  makes up 20 to 30 percent of our revenue overall but we also have a waiting list for things  
**[0:17:07-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:17:07):**  like our egg subscriptions are always you know we sell eggs for three months at a time  
**[0:17:13-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:17:13):**  and there's always a waiting list for them and we completely sold out of our like we  
**[0:17:19-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:17:19):**  keep some of our pastured boilers in the freezer just to spread over the winter because we're  
**[0:17:24-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:17:24):**  still selling eggs all through the winter and we sold out in November I think so we're  
**[0:17:31-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:17:31):**  in a rush to produce more and so we haven't changed our tactic so going on from that in  
**[0:17:41-0:17:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:17:41):**  Sweden right now there's people are going to work and businesses are open even if people  
**[0:17:48-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:17:48):**  are you know keeping themselves to themselves a bit more but right now the government advice  
**[0:17:54-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:17:54):**  is like restricting gatherings of more than 50 people and so what we've done specifically  
**[0:18:01-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:18:01):**  for the Rico ring and a Rico ring if people aren't aware what that is is basically a pre-sold  
**[0:18:07-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:18:07):**  online farmers market running through Facebook and you need to go look it up if you want  
**[0:18:12-0:18:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:18:12):**  to know more about it because it's a very sweet setup it's the most efficient sales  
**[0:18:19-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:18:19):**  model I've come across going on and we've been really championing that here and a lot  
**[0:18:25-0:18:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:18:25):**  of our students and followers have been taking that off to other parts of the world which  
**[0:18:30-0:18:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:18:30):**  is fantastic now that would typically be a group of 10 to 20 producers say turning up  
**[0:18:37-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:18:37):**  in their vehicles and they've already pre-sold whatever it is that they have vegetables eggs  
**[0:18:44-0:18:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:18:44):**  meat dairy whatever and so people are turning up and picking up their goods that they've  
**[0:18:50-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:18:50):**  already paid for and so it's a gathering and a lot of people pass through in a short time  
**[0:18:56-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:18:56):**  in the summer we run those for an hour in the winter for half an hour and we'll see  
**[0:19:00-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:19:00):**  you know 150 customers come through and they're just basically not taking very long at the  
**[0:19:08-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:19:08):**  stand they're just picking up their goods saying hello and off they go and so immediately  
**[0:19:14-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:19:14):**  what we've done is set up some guidelines for making sure that we spread out the distance  
**[0:19:22-0:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:19:22):**  between people and the timing of them coming through and we're sort of looking ahead to  
**[0:19:29-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:19:29):**  see well look you know some countries are limited to gatherings of no more than two  
**[0:19:35-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:19:35):**  so it's if we get this thing forward the way it's going in most places then we need to  
**[0:19:42-0:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:19:42):**  already start having systems in place for when it's not possible to run it like normal  
**[0:19:48-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:19:48):**  so already johanna's just actually gone there today to to the bigger rico that we participate  
**[0:19:53-0:19:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:19:53):**  in and she's gone as a volunteer to help start this system so she's been very much at the  
**[0:19:58-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:19:58):**  heart of setting up the rico rings that we're part of and is an admin for them so she's  
**[0:20:04-0:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:20:04):**  gone to sort of get everything in line i think she's been the most proactive person about  
**[0:20:10-0:20:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:20:10):**  this i think the general attitude in sweden is quite relaxed compared to most places so  
**[0:20:16-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:20:16):**  the way we've come up with for now is um we've organized the parking so that people don't  
**[0:20:24-0:20:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:20:24):**  all come at once and stand in the queue it's like five people come in at a time into the  
**[0:20:29-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:20:29):**  space and there's a couple of traffic cones and one of the admins is letting people out  
**[0:20:34-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:20:34):**  and so it's one in one out and we've told people you know something like based on the  
**[0:20:41-0:20:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:20:41):**  alphabetical order of their names if we've got and so we've made the slot a bit longer  
**[0:20:46-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:20:46):**  so right now it would normally be half an hour to pick up all the produce for all the  
**[0:20:50-0:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:20:50):**  people from all the producers so we've extended that to an hour the summer timing and people  
**[0:20:58-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:20:58):**  should aim to come in these five minute windows now obviously it won't work like clockwork  
**[0:21:03-0:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:21:03):**  but people are pretty respectful of that so it means people will be coming in in a concert  
**[0:21:11-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:21:11):**  constant flow of less people and then we're using the tables and stands as a way to distance  
**[0:21:17-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:21:17):**  ourselves now some producers just open the boot of their car and just stand there and  
**[0:21:22-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:21:22):**  you know shake hands and whatever so we've always had a stand and treated it a bit like  
**[0:21:28-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:21:28):**  a market so we've told people like you need to you know bring a table and separate yourself  
**[0:21:33-0:21:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:21:33):**  and we've informed all the rico customers which is nice because it's all on facebook  
**[0:21:38-0:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:21:38):**  you have a ring for the customers and then you have a producer's page a separate page  
**[0:21:43-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:21:43):**  for producers where we can discuss these sort of things but we've made all the customers  
**[0:21:49-0:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:21:49):**  aware ahead of time that hey it's not a time for chit chat right now it's like please come  
**[0:21:54-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:21:54):**  in the time slot within your hours best you can and just pick up your stuff and it seems  
**[0:22:01-0:22:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:22:01):**  i think it's going really well like that and so the only thing that's really led us to  
**[0:22:08-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:22:08):**  consider in terms of changing our strategy is offering less options with our veg and  
**[0:22:18-0:22:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:22:18):**  the way we've done veg is we went from veg boxes to as rico came along we started selling  
**[0:22:25-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:22:25):**  bunches which were basically planned around veg boxes but offered people more choice at  
**[0:22:33-0:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:22:33):**  a premium so they were they were willing to pay more money for the same thing because  
**[0:22:39-0:22:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:22:39):**  they had a choice over certain items and they had a choice not to have it certain weeks  
**[0:22:45-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:22:45):**  and that's always been important in sweden because people go away in the summer and they  
**[0:22:51-0:22:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:22:51):**  find it extremely difficult to coordinate with someone else to pick up the veg boxes  
**[0:22:56-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:22:56):**  like people aren't so social as in other countries in europe and it it's it strikes me as very  
**[0:23:02-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:23:02):**  bizarre but it's an issue for people and often people take quite long holidays here so so  
**[0:23:08-0:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:23:08):**  what we've considered doing now is reining back in on the choice and just offer one type  
**[0:23:14-0:23:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:23:14):**  of share basically again possibly two but we want to minimize handling and minimize  
**[0:23:21-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:23:21):**  like something we've always done like we've done tailored orders because people are willing  
**[0:23:27-0:23:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:23:27):**  to pay a premium we're more willing to tailor their orders but i think we've considered  
**[0:23:32-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:23:32):**  already to get rid of that and just offer the simplest minimal handling way to do everything  
**[0:23:39-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:23:39):**  which benefits us and it will benefit the customer too yeah but other than that to be  
**[0:23:44-0:23:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:23:44):**  a bit of an inconvenience i would imagine there'd be a good reception because they can  
**[0:23:48-0:23:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:23:48):**  see that it's in their best interest from a sanitary perspective yes definitely and  
**[0:23:54-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:23:54):**  i think obviously this situation is making own is only increasing the number of people  
**[0:24:02-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:24:02):**  who will identify the limitations of our typical food supply yeah and something really interesting  
**[0:24:11-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:24:11):**  that's going on is a lot of big conventional farms are are going to collapse this year  
**[0:24:19-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:24:19):**  because farm workers from poland lithuania aren't coming yeah and that's really interesting  
**[0:24:27-0:24:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:24:27):**  to me now i'm i'm someone that's sometimes uh got a finger pointed at me because i've  
**[0:24:34-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:24:34):**  got people coming here for training who are getting a training they can't get it pretty  
**[0:24:41-0:24:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:24:41):**  much any farm i can think of in europe and you know that all that free labor thing which  
**[0:24:48-0:24:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:24:48):**  is is so out of context anyway as i've explained in so many videos i try and share you know  
**[0:24:55-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:24:55):**  my thoughts about this thing but what's really interesting is that most people don't know  
**[0:25:00-0:25:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:25:00):**  how most of the conventional and organic conventional vegetables in europe are grown and the mass  
**[0:25:08-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:25:08):**  influx of highly underpaid eastern europeans that run the show or and the case around here  
**[0:25:16-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:25:16):**  in spain people from north africa and migrant workers from morocco and yeah yeah of course  
**[0:25:22-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:25:22):**  yeah yeah but that's gonna be yeah that's gonna change business models and and maybe  
**[0:25:30-0:25:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:25:30):**  that's for the best but i imagine it'll be a bit rocky in between yeah yeah well almost  
**[0:25:35-0:25:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:25:35):**  feel good at least to be in an industry that is going to be considered essential as long  
**[0:25:40-0:25:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:25:40):**  as there are humans and there's at least a certain amount of job security and that not  
**[0:25:44-0:25:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:25:44):**  that you were worried about that to begin with yeah i hope so i mean that holistic plan  
**[0:25:53-0:25:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:25:53):**  where i mean even if you weren't doing any business in some bizarre scenario you've got  
**[0:25:59-0:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:25:59):**  all of your bases covered as far as the needs of your your family and and then some yeah  
**[0:26:07-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:26:07):**  i mean there's definitely like i've always described this farm as a homestead that runs  
**[0:26:13-0:26:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:26:13):**  enterprises for profit and it wouldn't interest me to do any single enterprise on its own  
**[0:26:20-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:26:20):**  i wouldn't find that interesting or stimulating like we're we're farming to produce epic food  
**[0:26:28-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:26:28):**  and we it's partly because we want to eat epic food so there's there's a lot of there's  
**[0:26:34-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:26:34):**  a lot to be said for the resilience of diverse farming and it's it's great to always see  
**[0:26:41-0:26:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:26:41):**  the amount of new people coming into farming but i'm yeah i'm often a little bit bemused  
**[0:26:48-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:26:48):**  how there are so few diverse farms most people are picking up one enterprise and of course  
**[0:26:53-0:27:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:26:53):**  you've got to start somewhere but i suspect some a lot of people aren't exposed to the  
**[0:27:00-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:27:00):**  true benefit of having diversified farms and i mean that from from a human health perspective  
**[0:27:09-0:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:27:09):**  from an economic perspective from an ecosystem perspective too and and i think that's it's  
**[0:27:21-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:27:21):**  yeah it's hard to know what supply chains are gonna fall out in the in the prospect  
**[0:27:29-0:27:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:27:29):**  of an extended crisis but it's you know it's always good not to have all your eggs in one  
**[0:27:35-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:27:35):**  basket as it were and i i think a lot of i i think the repercussions of this if it goes  
**[0:27:44-0:27:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:27:44):**  on longer the the biggest repercussions are going to be the long-term economic consequences  
**[0:27:49-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:27:49):**  no and they're gonna they're gonna be far more drastic than the virus could ever be  
**[0:27:54-0:28:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:27:54):**  yeah and that's really gonna shake up the yeah yeah but that's really gonna change the  
**[0:28:02-0:28:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:28:02):**  way supply lines work and and it will affect people doing what we're doing also in ways  
**[0:28:08-0:28:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:28:08):**  that we can't foresee so any degree of resiliency you can build in is is gonna help with that  
**[0:28:15-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:28:15):**  but it's i think it's too early to really say i i see a lot of stuff online right now  
**[0:28:21-0:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:28:21):**  people jumping into there's a crisis let's find the opportunities here and yeah we have  
**[0:28:26-0:28:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:28:26):**  to do that but i think it's it's also very premature in some ways because a lot's gonna  
**[0:28:32-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:28:32):**  transpire that we we probably haven't even anticipated yet yeah it's it's inevitable  
**[0:28:39-0:28:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:28:39):**  i mean nothing like this has happened within our generation and i mean the context is even  
**[0:28:45-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:28:45):**  different from similar epidemics in the past uh given the way that we're all interconnected  
**[0:28:50-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:28:50):**  the global community is entirely interdependent at the moment and so making predictions from  
**[0:28:56-0:29:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:28:56):**  this vantage point is always going to come with limitations um yeah and so look let's  
**[0:29:03-0:29:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:29:03):**  put the the current situation aside a little bit because obviously it's going to play into  
**[0:29:08-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:29:08):**  anything that you would talk about for the current context and moving into the future  
**[0:29:13-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:29:13):**  but um so look you've traveled a lot in your life and you've consulted with and visited  
**[0:29:18-0:29:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:29:18):**  farms all over the world so i'd imagine that you have a really good reference for comparison  
**[0:29:22-0:29:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:29:22):**  and this is something that i'm really trying to understand better since i'm new to europe  
**[0:29:26-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:29:26):**  and though i've worked on farms in new zealand australia guatemala us all over the place  
**[0:29:32-0:29:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:29:32):**  um i'm still struggling to kind of understand what some of the advantages and disadvantages  
**[0:29:39-0:29:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:29:39):**  to starting farming enterprises specifically in europe particularly when it comes to factors  
**[0:29:44-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:29:44):**  like markets land access and regulations a lot of the things that really determine the  
**[0:29:48-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:29:48):**  success in the initial stages can you speak on that a little yeah um well it's a big one  
**[0:29:55-0:30:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:29:55):**  but i it's different by country europe is not one thing anymore yes africa or america  
**[0:30:03-0:30:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:30:03):**  is right but within that well i'd say it's much more diverse than america and probably  
**[0:30:13-0:30:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:30:13):**  much less diverse than africa but i mean america the differences between the states there are  
**[0:30:21-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:30:21):**  nothing like the differences between european countries and cultures i mean it's it's it's  
**[0:30:27-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:30:27):**  not comparable so the markets are very different all over the place you know here in northern  
**[0:30:34-0:30:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:30:34):**  europe these are very affluent countries where people typically like to prioritize spending  
**[0:30:41-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:30:41):**  as little as possible on meaningful things like good food but they will always have like  
**[0:30:48-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:30:48):**  the latest iphone and the biggest tv and all these kind of things so it's a bit of a conundrum  
**[0:30:55-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:30:55):**  you know it doesn't like i live next door to a multi-multi millionaire who will drive  
**[0:31:01-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:31:01):**  out of their way extra 20 kilometers to buy you know from like one of these super cheap  
**[0:31:07-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:31:07):**  chains like little or something but it's not it's a different one in sweden but that's  
**[0:31:12-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:31:12):**  someone that can afford to eat anything they want you know so that's a it's a funny thing  
**[0:31:17-0:31:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:31:17):**  you right next to them yeah they're super sweet people but it's like it it's an affluent  
**[0:31:23-0:31:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:31:23):**  place but the cost of living is high and the cost of taxation is high here i've been surprised  
**[0:31:29-0:31:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:31:29):**  actually as i've been connected to germany a bunch in the last year or two and it's there's  
**[0:31:34-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:31:34):**  a lot going on in germany right now and i've been surprised to see nearly all organic good  
**[0:31:45-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:31:45):**  produce the sorts of things we produce is more expensive in germany and all feed costs  
**[0:31:51-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:31:51):**  etc are lower so there's some great little businesses starting up there but in terms  
**[0:31:57-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:31:57):**  of northern europe because i think it's quite different in the east and the south obviously  
**[0:32:02-0:32:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:32:02):**  but the market here is is good and strong and people are fairly receptive i'd say like  
**[0:32:10-0:32:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:32:10):**  the nordic countries up here it's quite new like if you go down a bit to france germany  
**[0:32:17-0:32:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:32:17):**  holland belgium england people have more choice naturally you know like here the i think also  
**[0:32:26-0:32:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:32:26):**  because the population is very limited here so inside stockholm you can find what you  
**[0:32:32-0:32:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:32:32):**  want but out in the rural places like this there just isn't much competition i mean i  
**[0:32:37-0:32:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:32:37):**  i bought pastured boilers to sweden they didn't exist you know and the idea of pastured eggmobiles  
**[0:32:45-0:32:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:32:45):**  i don't think anyone was doing that when i got here so these are things that are quite  
**[0:32:50-0:32:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:32:50):**  old and common in many places but certainly in sweden it's you know we've really pioneered  
**[0:32:55-0:33:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:32:55):**  a lot of these things and it's starting to catch on which is great so so our market situation  
**[0:33:02-0:33:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:33:02):**  is quite different to to a lot of places in europe where these things are familiar and  
**[0:33:09-0:33:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:33:09):**  you you're going to have more competition going on and also population density where  
**[0:33:14-0:33:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:33:14):**  you know i know people at home in the uk that sell everything from their farms within a  
**[0:33:20-0:33:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:33:20):**  few miles of their farm and we don't even have people living a few miles from our farm  
**[0:33:26-0:33:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:33:26):**  so it's it's a the access to market i would say yes and it's you can't speak across europe  
**[0:33:35-0:33:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:33:35):**  in that way it's so different and in terms of land access that's what makes this country  
**[0:33:42-0:33:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:33:42):**  is why i moved to this country because i could buy a farm with cash and you know this farm  
**[0:33:49-0:33:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:33:49):**  costs me 90 000 euros and i've put about 110 000 euros in doing it up and it's turning  
**[0:33:56-0:34:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:33:56):**  over more than that combined sum every six months but in england this farm would be a  
**[0:34:01-0:34:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:34:01):**  million euros and probably you'd have to rebuild all the buildings to meet regulations and  
**[0:34:08-0:34:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:34:08):**  your selling price for all the products we produce here would be lower so it's why i've  
**[0:34:15-0:34:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:34:15):**  put so much of my educational efforts into crunching numbers and getting your contacts  
**[0:34:21-0:34:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:34:21):**  clear because it's like you can i have no doubt whatever country you drop me in i could  
**[0:34:26-0:34:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:34:26):**  plan a business that will function but it's going to look different according to land  
**[0:34:32-0:34:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:34:32):**  prices infrastructure prices and the market accessibility that's something that each and  
**[0:34:37-0:34:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:34:37):**  everyone has to thoroughly analyze for themselves because i i definitely can relate to like  
**[0:34:45-0:34:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:34:45):**  you know the the long-term trainings we've been doing at our farm each year are have  
**[0:34:51-0:34:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:34:51):**  been so critical for so many people starting out and it's a reality check it's a springboard  
**[0:34:57-0:35:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:34:57):**  and a reality check that's what this farm really is it's you know people come here with  
**[0:35:02-0:35:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:35:02):**  a pie in the sky dream of wanting to do this and that and it's like it it soon gets slapped  
**[0:35:09-0:35:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:35:09):**  out of them you know and many people come with a dream of being a market gardener and  
**[0:35:14-0:35:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:35:14):**  they leave and set up a chicken business and they thrive in it and they work half the time  
**[0:35:19-0:35:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:35:19):**  and earn more and it's it's really important that people first clarify their context and  
**[0:35:28-0:35:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:35:28):**  then plan a business and i think a lot of it's this it's the same dilemma i've been  
**[0:35:34-0:35:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:35:34):**  playing with for the last years it's the future of this type of farming relies on the flexible  
**[0:35:41-0:35:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:35:41):**  minded entrepreneurial folks that aren't coming from a long line of farmers stuck in their  
**[0:35:47-0:35:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:35:47):**  way stuck in pride and arrogance this is how we do it grandfather did it like this i do  
**[0:35:52-0:35:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:35:52):**  it like this and certainly down spain portugal you have the most glaring examples of that  
**[0:35:58-0:36:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:35:58):**  where they're plowing bare terracotta soils under their almonds and and carob trees and  
**[0:36:07-0:36:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:36:07):**  it's pride and arrogance and it's yeah well it's i see it all around me and i'm not even  
**[0:36:12-0:36:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:36:12):**  in one of the worst areas yeah well it's glaring the obvious there but the same thing happens  
**[0:36:17-0:36:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:36:17):**  all over it's just we've got a bit more humidity to to cover it up but yeah not as brittle  
**[0:36:23-0:36:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:36:23):**  of the ecosystem well so look yeah what you're talking about let's let's go in a little bit  
**[0:36:27-0:36:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:36:27):**  deeper to that um like i've been speaking to regenerative ag practitioners teachers  
**[0:36:31-0:36:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:36:31):**  and advocates for a good few years now and one of the reasons why i keep coming back  
**[0:36:36-0:36:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:36:36):**  to your information and resources is because of your really thorough analysis of those  
**[0:36:41-0:36:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:36:41):**  farm enterprises and the special financial modeling that helps you to make essential  
**[0:36:47-0:36:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:36:47):**  decisions on your own farm and its development so like you kind of glossed over some of the  
**[0:36:53-0:36:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:36:53):**  criteria that helps you decide on what business enterprises are going to be worthwhile for  
**[0:36:58-0:37:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:36:58):**  you can you kind of walk me through some of the essential questions and information gathering  
**[0:37:03-0:37:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:37:03):**  that you do when you're assessing a potential enterprise yeah well you know the yeah i'll  
**[0:37:11-0:37:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:37:11):**  try to do that and i think the the the the true answer to that is the book i wrote now  
**[0:37:20-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:37:20):**  i'm not just saying that to promote my book but that's exactly why i wrote regenerative  
**[0:37:25-0:37:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:37:25):**  agriculture that's entirely what the book is addressing because i just felt like that  
**[0:37:32-0:37:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:37:32):**  has been my um my quarantine reading i've finally started to break down that book and  
**[0:37:38-0:37:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:37:38):**  read it all the way through like a novel whereas before i kind of skimmed it because it's a  
**[0:37:41-0:37:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:37:41):**  700 page more uh volume worth getting through but i i highly recommend it yeah well the  
**[0:37:50-0:37:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:37:50):**  reason that came about is i would have people come in here on their training and you know  
**[0:37:59-0:38:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:37:59):**  they would say right i've got three hectares i want to do microdaring it's like no you'll  
**[0:38:05-0:38:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:38:05):**  never make economy out of that or i inherited my father's 100 acre farm in the south of  
**[0:38:12-0:38:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:38:12):**  england and i want to set up a market garden it's just like no that that's not responsible  
**[0:38:19-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:38:19):**  enough it's like people will give their leg for that farm and you just want to make a  
**[0:38:23-0:38:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:38:23):**  little market garden in the corner yeah so like something about taking responsibility  
**[0:38:31-0:38:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:38:31):**  and and seeing the bigger picture is part of it now in terms of that's not to say anyone  
**[0:38:37-0:38:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:38:37):**  should do anything it's it really of course must come down to to their context and most  
**[0:38:41-0:38:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:38:41):**  people aren't very clear about that so that's always the first bit we do but when it comes  
**[0:38:48-0:38:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:38:48):**  down like the the reason i wrote the book and i i it was a torturous process because  
**[0:38:54-0:39:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:38:54):**  i'm trying to compare like 13 14 different enterprises to give people a starting point  
**[0:39:00-0:39:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:39:00):**  because i know most people coming into this type of farming aren't from a farming background  
**[0:39:05-0:39:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:39:05):**  and when people aren't from a farming background they have no sense of scale they have no sense  
**[0:39:10-0:39:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:39:10):**  of life cycles and seasonal flows they have no sense of how heavy a machine is and why  
**[0:39:19-0:39:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:39:19):**  you shouldn't stick your arm in there and you know it's it's very clear the practicalities  
**[0:39:25-0:39:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:39:25):**  of both action and thinking of someone that's grown up in this way and so what i wanted  
**[0:39:32-0:39:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:39:32):**  to do is present people with like look okay you've just told me you have six hectares  
**[0:39:37-0:39:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:39:37):**  you have 50 000 euros to invest and you need to make 30 000 euros a year to maintain your  
**[0:39:42-0:39:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:39:42):**  quality of life cool here are three things that fit the bill and everything else here  
**[0:39:48-0:39:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:39:48):**  clearly doesn't right so now you've got a starting point so give up your dream to be  
**[0:39:54-0:39:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:39:54):**  a snail farmer and have a look at these three things let's plug in the numbers to these  
**[0:39:59-0:40:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:39:59):**  spreadsheets let's look at how the daily workflow would look the seasonal workflow would look  
**[0:40:04-0:40:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:40:04):**  let's have a go out in the field let's do it every day and see do you actually like  
**[0:40:09-0:40:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:40:09):**  this you know do you enjoy it and where could you make a unique in road into the market  
**[0:40:16-0:40:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:40:16):**  where you live etc so so once the context is clear what people actually want to do with  
**[0:40:21-0:40:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:40:21):**  their lives and their time then it comes down to numbers and size it's like how much size  
**[0:40:27-0:40:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:40:27):**  do you need to run this micro dairy to get you 45 000 euros out net okay well you're  
**[0:40:36-0:40:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:40:36):**  not in sweden here in sweden it's going to look like this for me because it takes me  
**[0:40:40-0:40:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:40:40):**  this much land to feed a cow but down where you are oh you can feed a cow on 60 of that  
**[0:40:48-0:40:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:40:48):**  land okay so let's adjust this to your setting so we can really get into the nuts and bolts  
**[0:40:54-0:41:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:40:54):**  and lay out a form of recipe and then people actually can see the vision and actuate it  
**[0:41:02-0:41:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:41:02):**  and that's been really successful with our training participants but it really comes  
**[0:41:07-0:41:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:41:07):**  down to a lot of thinking and and visualization and a lot of analysis of numbers yeah and  
**[0:41:16-0:41:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:41:16):**  that's one of the things that i like that's so well outlined in the book is that it really  
**[0:41:21-0:41:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:41:21):**  it profiles these enterprises that you've tested really well now definitely you've tested  
**[0:41:26-0:41:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:41:26):**  them to your specific context but by sliding the meters and adjusting the numbers specific  
**[0:41:31-0:41:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:41:31):**  to where someone is and what the resources are they're working with these are pretty  
**[0:41:35-0:41:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:41:35):**  well able to adapt to most of what's within this continent here i would say so i think  
**[0:41:44-0:41:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:41:44):**  it's relevant across the states canada all over i mean i know people are taking a lot  
**[0:41:50-0:41:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:41:50):**  of benefit from it in weird wonderful places where i wouldn't expect it to be of use but  
**[0:41:56-0:42:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:41:56):**  um all the better it's just the resilience of the other model yeah and the pattern aspect  
**[0:42:03-0:42:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:42:03):**  of it is applicable to anything but it i think it's really yeah as i said i i could apply  
**[0:42:11-0:42:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:42:11):**  this to anywhere i would need to do the same thinking that that person needs to do but  
**[0:42:17-0:42:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:42:17):**  i can prompt that person to do that thinking quicker and more efficiently and i can also  
**[0:42:23-0:42:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:42:23):**  set the boundaries by denying them the right to follow a certain thought train if i just  
**[0:42:30-0:42:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:42:30):**  can see it's ridiculous you know so part of my work is actually carefully weaving the  
**[0:42:40-0:42:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:42:40):**  the sort of financial and ecological aspect with their social spiritual life and and in  
**[0:42:51-0:42:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:42:51):**  that i'm quite careful to to step back and step forward to work with that person's unique  
**[0:42:59-0:43:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:42:59):**  character and temperament but but i'm very quick to shut down things that are not helpful  
**[0:43:06-0:43:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:43:06):**  you know people often want a dream and not see things as they are and i don't know how  
**[0:43:12-0:43:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:43:12):**  to explain that very clearly but but i guess it's a it's an element of mentoring you know  
**[0:43:18-0:43:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:43:18):**  yeah i'm sort of accelerating their thinking pathway as well as their practical skills  
**[0:43:24-0:43:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:43:24):**  pathway but but it really helps to run those numbers and we're doing a lot of background  
**[0:43:31-0:43:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:43:31):**  work this year to really up the ante with the online things that we can offer to help  
**[0:43:37-0:43:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:43:37):**  people get started because i think it's so helpful for people like you can you can get  
**[0:43:43-0:43:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:43:43):**  someone to drop this fantasy they've had for years just by looking through one data set  
**[0:43:51-0:43:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:43:51):**  yeah you know it just becomes startlingly obvious to someone like no this is not possible  
**[0:43:56-0:44:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:43:56):**  and another thing that's another thing that i i see in that is that some people are guilty  
**[0:44:03-0:44:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:44:03):**  about making a living you know some people have a very hard time setting the price on  
**[0:44:10-0:44:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:44:10):**  their time you know a lot of people just want to get by and say well what's that look like  
**[0:44:17-0:44:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:44:17):**  do you need 10 grand a year do you need 150 grand a year to get by what does that actually  
**[0:44:22-0:44:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:44:22):**  mean a lot of people can't answer that very clearly particularly young people because  
**[0:44:26-0:44:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:44:26):**  it's mostly young people that are coming into our training program as they're about to really  
**[0:44:31-0:44:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:44:31):**  springboard off and set this up but once those things are clear once your holistic context  
**[0:44:37-0:44:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:44:37):**  is clear and your financial means and needs are clear then it's pretty straightforward  
**[0:44:42-0:44:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:44:42):**  to set up a recipe that is likely to lead to success if diligence hard work commitment  
**[0:44:50-0:44:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:44:50):**  are present and if those things aren't present i doubt anything's going to work you know  
**[0:44:55-0:45:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:44:55):**  no one even knows the numbers all you want but if you're not willing to work for it yeah  
**[0:45:00-0:45:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:45:00):**  i don't know any successful business person who hasn't put the time in you know we've  
**[0:45:06-0:45:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:45:06):**  all done years of 100 hour weeks everyone i know that's been successful yeah and if  
**[0:45:12-0:45:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:45:12):**  you've got that kind of spirit then then this is a life you can do for sure so so i think  
**[0:45:19-0:45:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:45:19):**  that's i don't know and like you said really giving the reality for it but also the hope  
**[0:45:24-0:45:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:45:24):**  that if you put in the work if you really do proper assessments this is not an unrealistic  
**[0:45:29-0:45:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:45:29):**  thing despite a lot of what we see in the news about you know farming being in a not  
**[0:45:35-0:45:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:45:35):**  profitable lifestyle or just something that isn't viable in the modern context because  
**[0:45:40-0:45:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:45:40):**  it it throws a wrench in both sides of it so you don't go too far with the dreaming  
**[0:45:44-0:45:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:45:44):**  aspect and and start you know a bunch of enterprises that you can't possibly make meet uh make  
**[0:45:51-0:45:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:45:51):**  the ends meet on but also redefining the the possibilities at the same time and that middle  
**[0:45:57-0:46:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:45:57):**  line is really important for people to understand yeah and something i've been i haven't fully  
**[0:46:04-0:46:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:46:04):**  formulated my thoughts around it but it it's it's around temperament and character and  
**[0:46:11-0:46:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:46:11):**  that i like definitely farming is not for everyone and i'm becoming i guess what i'm  
**[0:46:16-0:46:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:46:16):**  trying to say is i'm becoming more confident in telling people that when i identify that  
**[0:46:23-0:46:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:46:23):**  because i'm in this i'm in a strange situation where you know i have i'm very careful how  
**[0:46:31-0:46:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:46:31):**  i approach the interns that come here we go through a very deep process because we're  
**[0:46:36-0:46:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:46:36):**  living very closely in each other's space and characteristically i've been spending  
**[0:46:42-0:46:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:46:42):**  you know from 6 30 in the morning till in the old days till eight nine ten o'clock at  
**[0:46:47-0:46:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:46:47):**  night with them for months and so i'm very i've watched a lot and i'm really scoping  
**[0:46:55-0:47:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:46:55):**  out where people are at and trying to address them in a way that will speak to them where  
**[0:47:00-0:47:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:47:00):**  they're at but i'm i'm not afraid to say anything to anyone but i definitely see i'm becoming  
**[0:47:09-0:47:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:47:09):**  more confident to encourage people to consider other things if i see that they don't have  
**[0:47:16-0:47:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:47:16):**  the spirit that it takes well speak on that for a little minute then what what is it that  
**[0:47:22-0:47:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:47:22):**  you noticed that you would define as the spirit that it takes to to have this type of line  
**[0:47:26-0:47:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:47:26):**  of work and lifestyle i think it focuses or is centered around like commitment discipline  
**[0:47:38-0:47:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:47:38):**  the ability to create like to optimize workflows and the ability to put those things into every  
**[0:47:49-0:47:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:47:49):**  single element of life so i i would see like the people that have that spirit have that  
**[0:47:59-0:48:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:47:59):**  spirit in everything they do in life you know whether it's work rest study playing and there's  
**[0:48:07-0:48:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:48:07):**  always people that want a bit of spoon feeding and it's like hey you know you paid money  
**[0:48:14-0:48:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:48:14):**  to come here and learn you want me to spoon feed you it's like if you if you haven't got  
**[0:48:18-0:48:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:48:18):**  that get up and get them thing it's like you're not you're not gonna make it in this field  
**[0:48:24-0:48:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:48:24):**  because it's like running a business i don't know anyone that runs any type of business  
**[0:48:30-0:48:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:48:30):**  that isn't hustling and putting that time in and they're working hard and fast for years  
**[0:48:37-0:48:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:48:37):**  and on top of that it's a farm business it's like you know there's no steeper road to climb  
**[0:48:44-0:48:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:48:44):**  there's so many variables yeah no it's totally doable but it it's not for everyone and i  
**[0:48:53-0:49:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:48:53):**  think that everyone that i've identified that's succeeding that has passed through our place  
**[0:49:00-0:49:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:49:00):**  and through our trainings whatever they've all got that same characteristic they they've  
**[0:49:06-0:49:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:49:06):**  come here as a paid they're paying for training and they will put in the same energy and dedication  
**[0:49:15-0:49:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:49:15):**  as if they were getting paid any amount of salary like it's not you know it doesn't the  
**[0:49:22-0:49:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:49:22):**  life circumstances aren't affecting their commitment and dedication to showing up moment  
**[0:49:29-0:49:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:49:29):**  to moment in life and that's that's the fundamental characteristic and do you feel like that is  
**[0:49:35-0:49:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:49:35):**  something that can be taught or either you've got it or you know that's the thing you've  
**[0:49:41-0:49:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:49:41):**  either got it or you've got you could teach yourself that but not not it's not the right  
**[0:49:46-0:49:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:49:46):**  word it's not about teaching yourself that you you can develop yourself and that might  
**[0:49:51-0:49:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:49:51):**  arise i guess is another way to say that but you can't teach someone that i'm very clear  
**[0:49:57-0:50:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:49:57):**  about that the way that we've created that culture here is i demonstrate that through  
**[0:50:03-0:50:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:50:03):**  my work ethic and i've chosen to surround myself as far as possible with a team who  
**[0:50:10-0:50:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:50:10):**  click straight into that and we don't sit around and talk about it we're demonstrating  
**[0:50:16-0:50:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:50:16):**  it to the point that you would feel out of place if you weren't in that same vibe you  
**[0:50:23-0:50:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:50:23):**  know and that has a massive influence on people you know it can pick people out of weird frames  
**[0:50:31-0:50:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:50:31):**  of mind and perspectives and it can it can empower them and change the way they interact  
**[0:50:37-0:50:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:50:37):**  that's on the one end but it it can clearly demonstrate to other people that they're not  
**[0:50:46-0:50:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:50:46):**  there they're not up for it you know which is a useful outcome too yeah i mean but i  
**[0:50:52-0:50:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:50:52):**  think i i definitely think you can't teach them that you can inspire someone but people  
**[0:50:58-0:51:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:50:58):**  tend to have to go through these kind of kairos moments you know some kind of like often people  
**[0:51:05-0:51:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:51:05):**  need to go through the depths of depression or burnout or heartache or loss to to step  
**[0:51:13-0:51:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:51:13):**  up their level of responsibility and showing up in the world you know some people have  
**[0:51:18-0:51:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:51:18):**  always done that but i don't think you can lead someone there you can just demonstrate  
**[0:51:23-0:51:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:51:23):**  it and that can influence people but i don't think you can teach that i don't i've never  
**[0:51:29-0:51:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:51:29):**  met anyone that can teach that that would be the next challenge well so look we've talked  
**[0:51:37-0:51:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:51:37):**  a lot about kind of setting up a resilient business model and certainly in the last handful  
**[0:51:41-0:51:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:51:41):**  of years it's been less than a decade now since you got ridgedale off the ground and  
**[0:51:46-0:51:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:51:46):**  have put out all these resources on the steps that you've taken to make this happen you've  
**[0:51:51-0:51:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:51:51):**  passed some really impressive milestones on the farm development and it seems that a lot  
**[0:51:55-0:52:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:51:55):**  of your initial building and enterprise development is kind of given way now to fine tuning maintenance  
**[0:52:00-0:52:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:52:00):**  and increasing efficiency so my question is what does it look like for your daily schedule  
**[0:52:06-0:52:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:52:06):**  and has it changed how you observe and run the farm now or are you just kind of taking  
**[0:52:11-0:52:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:52:11):**  on more projects now that the initial ones are kind of running well it's a it's an interesting  
**[0:52:18-0:52:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:52:18):**  year to ask that because i wasn't planning to actually be on the farm all year this year  
**[0:52:25-0:52:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:52:25):**  so my plan this year so the last couple of years i've really started to notice the impact  
**[0:52:31-0:52:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:52:31):**  we've had now you know i get a lot of email and messages and i i'm aware of some of the  
**[0:52:38-0:52:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:52:38):**  influence but the last couple of years i've really noticed it i've seen hundreds of egg  
**[0:52:44-0:52:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:52:44):**  mobiles that look like ours all over the world popping up i've seen so many people take our  
**[0:52:51-0:52:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:52:51):**  approach to market gardening and scale it and run with it and run their businesses i've  
**[0:52:58-0:53:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:52:58):**  seen other people making micro abattoirs based on ours and i decided last year that i wanted  
**[0:53:07-0:53:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:53:07):**  to take a year off to rest a bit because i got to the edge of burnout and to the point  
**[0:53:15-0:53:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:53:15):**  where i decided no i need a year out and really get perspective on where to put my energy  
**[0:53:20-0:53:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:53:20):**  now because i'm in a pretty interesting place now where i have a full-time job outside the  
**[0:53:27-0:53:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:53:27):**  farm also and i have a child and so it's i need to really get a bit of perspective on where's  
**[0:53:37-0:53:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:53:37):**  best to put my energy to fulfill the educational objectives i have running the farm now last  
**[0:53:44-0:53:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:53:44):**  year we took back interns again so i'm working with a small group of up to 10 people and  
**[0:53:51-0:53:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:53:51):**  i love that program because there's like basically it's a program for people who've realized  
**[0:53:56-0:53:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:53:56):**  they want to go to ag school but ag school is not going to give them anything like what  
**[0:53:59-0:54:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:53:59):**  they need and that's what that program is for it's it's the highest level of engagement  
**[0:54:06-0:54:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:54:06):**  in regenerative ag that i've ever seen offered anywhere in the planet it's three months full  
**[0:54:12-0:54:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:54:12):**  time half in the class studying very intensely and then targeted work in the field to experience  
**[0:54:22-0:54:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:54:22):**  the particular things that are in the program so they're not really running the farm they're  
**[0:54:28-0:54:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:54:28):**  doing targeted work experience to give them the confidence to leave with the business  
**[0:54:34-0:54:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:54:34):**  plan and land plan that they've created during that time and many of them have i would say  
**[0:54:39-0:54:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:54:39):**  a high proportion have gone off and done that but last year it was a group of a lot of young  
**[0:54:46-0:54:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:54:46):**  people and i noticed the age gap is increasing and i don't mean that just in that i'm getting  
**[0:54:53-0:55:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:54:53):**  older i also mean that i'm concerned about generations in their early 20s now the the  
**[0:55:02-0:55:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:55:02):**  loss of the value of things that i hold dear like commitment discipline living by your  
**[0:55:08-0:55:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:55:08):**  word if you say you're doing something you are reliable and trustworthy so these things  
**[0:55:14-0:55:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:55:14):**  don't seem as valued anymore the world is changing in a very rapid way that such that  
**[0:55:23-0:55:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:55:23):**  the generation gaps are getting shorter i think and i still hold a lot of the values  
**[0:55:29-0:55:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:55:29):**  of my parents generation very dear and i believe that they're fundamental to the well-being  
**[0:55:35-0:55:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:55:35):**  of our society so i'm a little concerned about things and i got pretty demotivated last year  
**[0:55:42-0:55:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:55:42):**  because i felt like i'm putting a stupid amount of energy into what i do and it's to a very  
**[0:55:50-0:55:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:55:50):**  limited group of people some of whom i know do not even understand the benefit of what's  
**[0:55:56-0:56:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:55:56):**  going on here and will not put this to use and why am i giving my time like this because  
**[0:56:03-0:56:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:56:03):**  i'm getting older and tired i'm getting tired i can't work at the rate i used to so i really  
**[0:56:09-0:56:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:56:09):**  started to consider like how better to leverage my work and that led me to really consider  
**[0:56:16-0:56:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:56:16):**  how to leverage what i do online and to try and collaborate with other people because  
**[0:56:22-0:56:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:56:22):**  i don't have time and don't have the skills to really leverage that and so what i decided  
**[0:56:28-0:56:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:56:28):**  to do was take a year off the farm to actually travel around europe and see all the farms  
**[0:56:35-0:56:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:56:35):**  that we've influenced and that our students have set up and go film them and document  
**[0:56:41-0:56:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:56:41):**  them and for me that would be a big rest it would be really interesting to see what we've  
**[0:56:46-0:56:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:56:46):**  spawned and it would also fulfill another strong function which is for yohana to take  
**[0:56:53-0:56:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:56:53):**  more of a leadership role outside on the farm operation because she's been very much central  
**[0:56:59-0:57:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:56:59):**  to the sales and communications in the background and so i kind of felt like alleviating the  
**[0:57:10-0:57:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:57:10):**  focus on me i started to feel like people were coming here not for the value of the  
**[0:57:15-0:57:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:57:15):**  training that was being led but all becoming increasingly influenced by me you know like  
**[0:57:25-0:57:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:57:25):**  becoming for me in some way and becoming a farming guru yeah yeah and i'm not happy about  
**[0:57:31-0:57:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:57:31):**  that you know so so i felt like it was forming into this really nice thing that was leading  
**[0:57:39-0:57:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:57:39):**  to our context our family context changing into like we felt like we needed to address  
**[0:57:46-0:57:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:57:46):**  that time has been a limiting factor and we decided we wanted you know take it a bit easier  
**[0:57:54-0:57:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:57:54):**  and take a bit of the the fruit take a bit of the harvest of the work we've put in because  
**[0:57:59-0:58:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:57:59):**  i calculated while i was away on an extended holiday this winter i calculated that i've  
**[0:58:07-0:58:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:58:07):**  put in 15 years of work weeks on the actual farm in the last six years that's the hours  
**[0:58:14-0:58:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:58:14):**  i've put in and i can't do that anymore and i don't need to do that anymore so so actually  
**[0:58:22-0:58:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:58:22):**  yeah i plan to be away all summer and do this project which looks like i won't be able to  
**[0:58:28-0:58:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:58:28):**  travel but i'm rapidly creating a online solution to that with a collaborator so that's been  
**[0:58:37-0:58:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:58:37):**  another big thing that's happened for me is i finally found someone to closely collaborate  
**[0:58:42-0:58:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:58:42):**  with and tell me about that and i know the farming like a hero is is the name of the  
**[0:58:50-0:58:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:58:50):**  project and and that a lot of things are kind of up in the air now and perhaps the travel  
**[0:58:54-0:58:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:58:54):**  won't be possible but do you want to kind of outline some of the things that are coming  
**[0:58:59-0:59:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:58:59):**  available and the collaboration that you're getting into yeah so we um well this lady's  
**[0:59:07-0:59:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:59:07):**  danish lady who who contacted me and wrote me a very clear well thought through structured  
**[0:59:17-0:59:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:59:17):**  proposal of how she could use her professional skills to leverage what i'm doing and it really  
**[0:59:25-0:59:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:59:25):**  struck my attention because i've always seen that education is going fully online and that  
**[0:59:31-0:59:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:59:31):**  schools will just not be necessary in the future except for some kind of local mentorship  
**[0:59:37-0:59:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:59:37):**  around topics that cannot be dealt with online but digital learning gives us access to the  
**[0:59:44-0:59:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:59:44):**  best people on any subject and i think there's something very powerful about that and i thought  
**[0:59:51-0:59:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:59:51):**  it was going to develop in a certain way and it seems to develop in a different you know  
**[0:59:59-1:00:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:59:59):**  uniquely powerful around the world for how people access in knowledge and and actually  
**[1:00:05-1:00:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:00:05):**  have attention for and so i'll be really considering that of like well why am i putting my energy  
**[1:00:12-1:00:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:00:12):**  into these 10 people when i could surely reach 10 000 people with the same effort and i've  
**[1:00:21-1:00:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:00:21):**  been you know pretty much flying solo trying to make videos trying to put together stuff  
**[1:00:26-1:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:00:26):**  for people like resources but it's it's definitely true that having someone professional that  
**[1:00:33-1:00:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:00:33):**  knows how to package that and present that is you know able to reach far more people  
**[1:00:40-1:00:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:00:40):**  in a powerful way and so this lady wrote a year-long plan step by step of how to basically  
**[1:00:48-1:00:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:00:48):**  overhaul everything i do online and i was like wow this is perfect because i've been  
**[1:00:53-1:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:00:53):**  looking for someone to collaborate or support me for years but it's not it's not a job i  
**[1:00:59-1:01:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:00:59):**  could offer someone because the time it would take me to train someone to help me i may  
**[1:01:05-1:01:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:01:05):**  as well do it myself yeah i've just kept on doing it myself so to find someone who already  
**[1:01:13-1:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:01:13):**  has followed us for years has taken our online training has read our book who knows enough  
**[1:01:19-1:01:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:01:19):**  about me to know the context of how i'm approaching things and can already foresee exactly how  
**[1:01:24-1:01:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:01:24):**  they can help is powerful and perfect so so what happened with that is the first part  
**[1:01:32-1:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:01:32):**  of it is to try and bring a lot more value with this tour so my original idea is right  
**[1:01:37-1:01:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:01:37):**  i'm going to jump in my truck drive around europe film all these farms and chuck it on  
**[1:01:41-1:01:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:01:41):**  youtube and that's all good in one way but we felt like there's a lot more we could do  
**[1:01:49-1:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:01:49):**  with that and one big part of that is creating community like to help people connect like  
**[1:01:55-1:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:01:55):**  something i noticed when i filmed a few of our students farms in the last couple of years  
**[1:02:01-1:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:02:01):**  is that when i put those videos online they all started connecting up and i noticed that  
**[1:02:06-1:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:02:06):**  through ridgedale is a lot of the interns and core team have connected across the years  
**[1:02:12-1:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:02:12):**  and it's an amazing network this there are a dozen farms in europe that are run by our  
**[1:02:19-1:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:02:19):**  interns and they work and cross-pollinate between each other i know interns that have  
**[1:02:25-1:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:02:25):**  worked at five different people's farms who are all interns here wow and there's farms  
**[1:02:30-1:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:02:30):**  run by three of our interns who are all from different years here you know and like these  
**[1:02:36-1:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:02:36):**  connections are amazing and i've been thinking about also this one degree of separation or  
**[1:02:42-1:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:02:42):**  two degrees of separation where it's like you know if i like i know what i've exposed  
**[1:02:50-1:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:02:50):**  my interns and network too and because i've spent a long time with them i got a good sense  
**[1:02:58-1:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:02:58):**  of who they are and how they think so if this guy who's worked with me for a season here  
**[1:03:04-1:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:03:04):**  says this guy is trustworthy and cool then that one degree of separation is okay and  
**[1:03:12-1:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:03:12):**  that's how we build a network i've had people here sent here by some of the most famous  
**[1:03:17-1:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:03:17):**  people in the field who have just turned out to be absolutely not useful with us and they  
**[1:03:23-1:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:03:23):**  might have been perfect with that other person but their context is so entirely different  
**[1:03:28-1:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:03:28):**  that it just doesn't translate right that's not to say anything bad about anyone it seems  
**[1:03:34-1:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:03:34):**  like a natural consequence of different contexts but by keeping a certain degree of separation  
**[1:03:40-1:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:03:40):**  you can avoid that because there's so many people looking you know i get asked daily  
**[1:03:45-1:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:03:45):**  by email do you know a good place in europe to go and learn about agroforestry or whatever  
**[1:03:50-1:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:03:50):**  it is so the skill of a good network is going to be keeping it so it's not open to everyone  
**[1:03:59-1:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:03:59):**  you know it's open to one degree of separation so everyone can vouch for everyone not vouch  
**[1:04:04-1:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:04:04):**  for but you know what i mean like it keeps the connections tight yeah yeah so so that's  
**[1:04:10-1:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:04:10):**  another piece that we want to do is like after seeing like the people that i made little  
**[1:04:15-1:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:04:15):**  videos with it brings some a massive amount of attention and it starts them all connecting  
**[1:04:21-1:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:04:21):**  together and i notice a lot of people look to the states to watch videos whatever it's  
**[1:04:28-1:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:04:28):**  like man we have so much going on in europe and loads better stuff in fact most of the  
**[1:04:32-1:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:04:32):**  stuff going on in the states was inspired and came from europe it's just you don't know  
**[1:04:37-1:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:04:37):**  about that person and so that's i started thinking i'll call it the unsung hero tour  
**[1:04:43-1:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:04:43):**  i'm gonna put these people on a pedestal and use my platform to shine light on these people  
**[1:04:48-1:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:04:48):**  who do awesome stuff that you haven't heard of because we've all heard of the famous names  
**[1:04:51-1:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:04:51):**  the joe salins etc but it's like what about this dude over here that no one's heard of  
**[1:04:56-1:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:04:56):**  who's awesome at doing this thing and then that was the basis of the tour and so we decided  
**[1:05:04-1:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:05:04):**  to keep on the hero theme but it's going to be called farm like a hero tour it's going  
**[1:05:10-1:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:05:10):**  to be called the farm like a hero experience but we're gonna start off by doing like zoom  
**[1:05:16-1:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:05:16):**  meetings like we're on now yeah and if possible later in the summer i'll go on the tour still  
**[1:05:24-1:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:05:24):**  on whichever bits i can there's no doubt that the film i can make on the farm a long form  
**[1:05:31-1:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:05:31):**  video of an hour and a half with with the farmer is going to be much more compelling  
**[1:05:36-1:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:05:36):**  and informative so it's not like people said well why don't you do that next year but i  
**[1:05:42-1:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:05:42):**  can't just leave my farm for a year it's pretty unprecedented that i was gonna leave this  
**[1:05:47-1:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:05:47):**  year and i have a family also so it's not so simple i can't just go next year so i decided  
**[1:05:53-1:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:05:53):**  okay i'm prepared to do it fully in conference calls if need be but the way we can make more  
**[1:06:00-1:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:06:00):**  value out of that is to create an ebook with all these farms so here's 100 farms and we  
**[1:06:08-1:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:06:08):**  ask them to write 5000 words and tell us their revenue and their net and the investments  
**[1:06:14-1:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:06:14):**  they've put in the things that are going good you know get some data out of there so that  
**[1:06:19-1:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:06:19):**  by the end of it we've got 100 awesome regenerative farms around europe and it's like oh so can  
**[1:06:26-1:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:06:26):**  you tell me somewhere good that i can go and learn about quail production it's like well  
**[1:06:31-1:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:06:31):**  there you go bam have a look at that and really create this resource yeah so we're going to  
**[1:06:38-1:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:06:38):**  build a dedicated facebook group and have live questions and answers and particularly  
**[1:06:46-1:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:06:46):**  be speaking and connecting people around country specific stuff so how people are dealing with  
**[1:06:52-1:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:06:52):**  this coronavirus and the restrictions to selling etc how people are dealing with local regulations  
**[1:06:59-1:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:06:59):**  because one thing that happens is people come they look at their eggmobiles they go home  
**[1:07:03-1:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:07:03):**  and they build their eggmobile without checking their local regulations yeah i always tell  
**[1:07:07-1:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:07:07):**  them to make sure that fits their context i've built it in this way for these reasons  
**[1:07:13-1:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:07:13):**  and it doesn't mean you should build yours this way but people are looking for standardized  
**[1:07:18-1:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:07:18):**  solutions despite the fact there aren't any in farming but but this network is really  
**[1:07:24-1:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:07:24):**  needed to help people with a one degree of separation as it were now something i've noticed  
**[1:07:32-1:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:07:32):**  i don't know if you'd agree with this oliver is i feel like the era of good facebook groups  
**[1:07:38-1:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:07:38):**  died when the old group down doctor used to run stopped that was like the last of the  
**[1:07:47-1:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:07:47):**  good facebook groups i don't use facebook groups i think those kind of died before i  
**[1:07:52-1:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:07:52):**  even got onto them and yeah i agree the quality of discourse on those is uh it's i'm sure  
**[1:07:57-1:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:07:57):**  it's not what it was originally intended to be no and it's not just about quality of discourse  
**[1:08:03-1:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:08:03):**  is that i don't trust your answer to my problem with my chickens because i don't know anything  
**[1:08:09-1:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:08:09):**  about you or who you are or your context right that's where the degree of separation is important  
**[1:08:16-1:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:08:16):**  it's like i got a whole network of people who i know enough about their thinking to  
**[1:08:21-1:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:08:21):**  know how to analyze their answers also and that's the sort of network that's really strong  
**[1:08:28-1:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:08:28):**  so in summary yeah so in summary that's that's the plan we're gonna actually launch it as  
**[1:08:36-1:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:08:36):**  in the next few weeks uh hopefully in the beginning of may we're gonna start a subscription  
**[1:08:42-1:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:08:42):**  site it's gonna be very cheap price of a coffee every week but it's gonna honor the you know  
**[1:08:47-1:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:08:47):**  i think we're estimated to put 300 hours just into making the interviews and that's just  
**[1:08:55-1:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:08:55):**  if we do it on computer if i was driving around europe that's six months full-time work so  
**[1:09:01-1:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:09:01):**  it's a lot of work and it's unrealistic for me to do that completely free because i've  
**[1:09:07-1:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:09:07):**  already invested 15 grand to set up sites and learning platforms and basically as part  
**[1:09:15-1:09:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:09:15):**  of a bigger project we're transitioning all our online stuff to professional more professional  
**[1:09:23-1:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:09:23):**  uh hostings and programs to optimize that experience for people and that's what my collaborator  
**[1:09:29-1:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:09:29):**  does she works with uh copywriting and online running online sales and promotions and branding  
**[1:09:40-1:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:09:40):**  and all this stuff all this stuff that i've kind of never studied i've done all right for myself  
**[1:09:47-1:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:09:47):**  but to have a professional on board who knows how to leverage that can just bring far more benefit  
**[1:09:53-1:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:09:53):**  all over the place and take a lot of work off my shoulders which is the main help for me so  
**[1:10:00-1:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:10:00):**  yeah and you can't do everything at a high level you it's best to focus on what you're good at and  
**[1:10:05-1:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:10:05):**  leave certain things to other professionals yes there's a lot to get a little diluted if you try  
**[1:10:11-1:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:10:11):**  and do everything yeah it's totally true but it that's part of the process and it's exactly the  
**[1:10:18-1:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:10:18):**  process i've been through it's like it just to find someone who can do that it's like it's not  
**[1:10:23-1:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:10:23):**  the sort of thing i just want to pay someone to help me with it's got to be someone with real  
**[1:10:29-1:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:10:29):**  skin in the game in my game you know and so it's it's hard to it's not something you could contrive  
**[1:10:36-1:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:10:36):**  it's something that has to happen naturally but it's a cool process to to to see how that's  
**[1:10:43-1:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:10:43):**  unfolded i've been really wanting that for some years but it's really happening in in a natural  
**[1:10:49-1:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:10:49):**  way that feels like it's going to bring a lot of benefit to to me to my collaborator and to a whole  
**[1:10:56-1:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:10:56):**  network of people so we'll see how that i'm super excited about it personally i do you have any  
**[1:11:02-1:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:11:02):**  dates that you can say yet or is it still a little undefined we're hoping to launch the like we're  
**[1:11:10-1:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:11:10):**  rebuilding websites so everything we do online and it's culminating at the end of the year with  
**[1:11:17-1:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:11:17):**  launching a few different online training options and it's all totally being redone and put on  
**[1:11:24-1:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:11:24):**  a different platform and a lot more content added but the farm like a hero tour will  
**[1:11:31-1:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:11:31):**  i basically had the the physical trip was divided up into sections starting 18th of april  
**[1:11:39-1:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:11:39):**  so and that was to go to spain and south of france and portugal before coming back here to host joel  
**[1:11:46-1:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:11:46):**  salatin for our master class at the farm so i'm basically canceling that bit of the trip for now  
**[1:11:53-1:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:11:53):**  and we've had to reschedule joel to the autumn here hoping that can go ahead in the autumn  
**[1:12:00-1:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:12:00):**  so i was basically planning to take some of the later dates and move them to the front and start  
**[1:12:11-1:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:12:11):**  offering twice weekly long form uh interviews from  
**[1:12:18-1:12:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:12:18):**  well it'll be about we're hoping to launch in a month's time basically okay so first of may and  
**[1:12:28-1:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:12:28):**  and what that would allow me to do the fiddling that's been going on the background because it's  
**[1:12:32-1:12:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:12:32):**  obviously been a mammoth task just organizing a route around europe and getting everyone to dates  
**[1:12:39-1:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:12:39):**  where i would show up so it's been a massive planning work that now i'm going to be doing  
**[1:12:45-1:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:12:45):**  a massive planning work that now i'm trying to work off the back of that and keep the  
**[1:12:52-1:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:12:52):**  as many of those dates as possible so that i can say right obviously i'm not coming to visit you  
**[1:12:58-1:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:12:58):**  but let's talk this day and then please if you want to be included in this book  
**[1:13:05-1:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:13:05):**  here's a task for you to do for the rest of the day because they've already slotted slotted it  
**[1:13:12-1:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:13:12):**  out for me to be here i'm really excited about that i think definitely you know having interviews  
**[1:13:17-1:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:13:17):**  is going to be less rewarding than filming farms but i think that's where the book could be  
**[1:13:23-1:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:13:23):**  really backing that up because i think the conversations will go in different directions  
**[1:13:27-1:13:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:13:27):**  naturally whereas the book will be you know a formula that's the same that allows people to  
**[1:13:32-1:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:13:32):**  compare many different places across different countries and yeah yeah yeah i'm super excited for  
**[1:13:38-1:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:13:38):**  it well you definitely count me and i'm really looking forward to this coming out and understanding  
**[1:13:43-1:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:13:43):**  the the context of my area even better and hopefully linking up with other people doing  
**[1:13:48-1:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:13:48):**  regenerative farming in this area of spain and then southern europe in general um yeah i can't  
**[1:13:54-1:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:13:54):**  wait uh now one last question before you go now that you've reached this level of development with  
**[1:14:00-1:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:14:00):**  your farm what are some of the key goals that you have for the coming years is there are any major  
**[1:14:06-1:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:14:06):**  goals that you're still kind of looking to achieve yeah our main goals focus around balance like time  
**[1:14:17-1:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:14:17):**  family balance work life balance and it there was certainly some years of just keeping scaling up  
**[1:14:28-1:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:14:28):**  and wanting to push that and push that and i really let go of that finally where like i always had a  
**[1:14:34-1:14:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:14:34):**  dream to see how much can be done on this space and just push it to the maximum but we don't need  
**[1:14:41-1:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:14:41):**  to do that it's like we don't need to do a lot of things that we do we've been doing them for  
**[1:14:46-1:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:14:46):**  other people's benefit it's like we have all our food we don't have debt we earn enough money it's  
**[1:14:52-1:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:14:52):**  like it we don't need any more so that was kind of like a a big realization a year and a half two  
**[1:15:01-1:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:15:01):**  years ago so like now we don't need to do this like it it will benefit some people but at what  
**[1:15:08-1:15:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:15:08):**  cost you know if it's costing us our health it's not worth it so our real our goal now is just to  
**[1:15:14-1:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:15:14):**  sit back and enjoy it more and take some of the stress away and and the big part for us with that  
**[1:15:22-1:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:15:22):**  is is bringing in longer-term people that's been the biggest challenge here is that it's amazing  
**[1:15:28-1:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:15:28):**  the opportunities we've been able to give people but we are literally starting with new people  
**[1:15:33-1:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:15:33):**  we've always tried to have at least one person who's done a season here the next year it's not  
**[1:15:39-1:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:15:39):**  always possible because the people that are really good and naturally the people that go off and  
**[1:15:44-1:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:15:44):**  start their own thing you know so it's very hard to get the best people to stay and it's also a  
**[1:15:52-1:15:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:15:52):**  big i i had a few years ago i asked some of the best people that have been here to join the actual  
**[1:15:58-1:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:15:58):**  business and give them you know an opportunity that i doubt they would ever get offered again but  
**[1:16:04-1:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:16:04):**  it's a big ask because i'm asking them to come and plant roots in the middle of nowhere in sweden  
**[1:16:11-1:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:16:11):**  and they're typically not swedish people but now over this winter we've started to work with  
**[1:16:18-1:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:16:18):**  local young families and there are several people who we foresee could be you know longer term in  
**[1:16:28-1:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:16:28):**  place so that we because the actual work we do is fairly easeful you know you need four people to  
**[1:16:35-1:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:16:35):**  run this farm at full production and that will pay them a white collar salary but you then get  
**[1:16:43-1:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:16:43):**  then get four or five months off and it's quite easeful if we if we didn't have to train people  
**[1:16:52-1:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:16:52):**  from scratch it would just get easier and easier and easier so that's what we're dreaming about is  
**[1:16:59-1:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:16:59):**  just having the you know like every year you forget you forget like you know people coming  
**[1:17:06-1:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:17:06):**  that just like it blows your mind like people haven't they it's very hard to judge online even  
**[1:17:13-1:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:17:13):**  talking to people on face to face on skype or whatever you know people say all kinds of things  
**[1:17:20-1:17:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:17:20):**  i've had people at the chainsaw certified teaching people to sculpt bits of wood that they're  
**[1:17:27-1:17:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:17:27):**  standing on with sandals you know and people that have just come out of buddha feeding chickens  
**[1:17:34-1:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:17:34):**  handling chicken shit who have not washed their hands and started like handling salad for 30  
**[1:17:41-1:17:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:17:41):**  people with you know it's like stuff that just blows your mind because it's like uh hello but  
**[1:17:48-1:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:17:48):**  it happens every year it's like people need nanny and if you don't come from this life you just don't  
**[1:17:54-1:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:17:54):**  necessarily think straight you know yeah and so our biggest dream however silly it sounds is to  
**[1:18:01-1:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:18:01):**  like just not have to do any of that hand holding and just work with a few people who you know who  
**[1:18:09-1:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:18:09):**  just know how to do their thing and that's our biggest goal and just watch the ecosystem develop  
**[1:18:16-1:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:18:16):**  i mean it's been amazing just seeing how many species have moved into our farm and the resilience  
**[1:18:22-1:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:18:22):**  the droughts a couple years ago accelerated trajectory that's incredible and it's really  
**[1:18:27-1:18:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:18:27):**  interesting to hear like with this level advancement because i mean for most people  
**[1:18:31-1:18:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:18:31):**  what is it now seven years into farming would not be anywhere near the level where they could start  
**[1:18:37-1:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:18:37):**  to coast or start worrying about the the development things that you just talked about but  
**[1:18:43-1:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:18:43):**  it just goes to show how like you know it it must have been an absolutely herculean feat to get all  
**[1:18:49-1:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:18:49):**  of these things off the ground while running educational programs i mean i've done half of  
**[1:18:53-1:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:18:53):**  those things and burned out because of poor planning i'm not afraid to admit and and to see  
**[1:19:00-1:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:19:00):**  that like it's gotten to this point so quickly is is really interesting to watch yeah it's cool  
**[1:19:07-1:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:19:07):**  but it is as i said it you know i really have put in 15 work years it's not come without cast i've  
**[1:19:14-1:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:19:14):**  got gray hairs and wrinkles that i shouldn't have genetically right now and i yeah i don't want to  
**[1:19:23-1:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:19:23):**  do that anymore but i did want to do that before you know like i was burning up it was i the only  
**[1:19:30-1:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:19:30):**  way i can explain that is like something moving through me you know it wasn't decisions i made i  
**[1:19:37-1:19:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:19:37):**  just woke up every day pumped to go but i don't i've been quite clear with people i don't  
**[1:19:43-1:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:19:43):**  necessarily recommend trying to do things so fast like i am i have put a lot of energy into planning  
**[1:19:49-1:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:19:49):**  and also came to it with a lot of experience that's you know i had planned a lot of properties  
**[1:19:56-1:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:19:56):**  so i'm i was very confident what i was doing and it's just fun i think i posted on facebook just  
**[1:20:02-1:20:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:20:02):**  a couple of weeks ago one of these things popped up to remind you and it was a photo of me  
**[1:20:09-1:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:20:09):**  in thailand it was where i met matt who was a significant person here and i just drew  
**[1:20:18-1:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:20:18):**  the design of the farm i hadn't even i'd spent two hours on the farm under snow and i just  
**[1:20:23-1:20:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:20:23):**  remember explaining what i was going to do when i got home and it was that spring i came back from  
**[1:20:29-1:20:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:20:29):**  southeast asia that we started and just funny seeing that photo and seeing like every single  
**[1:20:36-1:20:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:20:36):**  thing we plan to do has come to pass and a few things even quicker but it's from just a lot of  
**[1:20:43-1:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:20:43):**  planning and it's a joyful process a lot of people don't put enough time into the the planning and  
**[1:20:50-1:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:20:50):**  number crunching because quite frankly it's pretty mind-boggling and there's better things to do but  
**[1:20:56-1:21:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:20:56):**  it's it's like um i can't think of a good analogy but like spreadsheets like most people turn their  
**[1:21:04-1:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:21:04):**  heads when you know roll their eyes when they see that but but the people are gonna succeed get  
**[1:21:11-1:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:21:11):**  excited by that because when you're in control of those numbers and when you're in control of the  
**[1:21:17-1:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:21:17):**  overall plan and time flow it gives you a calm confidence and the sureness of what you're doing  
**[1:21:26-1:21:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:21:26):**  and that's really important well it directs you of the priority of when to take certain actions  
**[1:21:32-1:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:21:32):**  and what needs to be prioritized and yeah that's a big part of what we try and do  
**[1:21:40-1:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:21:40):**  what we try and really like show people a window into when they're here but i don't recommend  
**[1:21:47-1:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:21:47):**  people try so much at once it's definitely been stressful at times because of that  
**[1:21:55-1:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:21:55):**  well look rigid that's a really good place to kind of transition over could you tell us a little bit  
**[1:22:00-1:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:22:00):**  about well for the the sake of our listeners where they can find all of your information  
**[1:22:05-1:22:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:22:05):**  and their resources so that they can get plugged in to what you have coming out soon  
**[1:22:12-1:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:22:12):**  yeah well i guess like most stuff comes out on our youtube channel so you can look up  
**[1:22:18-1:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:22:18):**  richard perkins on youtube you'll find documentation of the last years of our farm it's  
**[1:22:24-1:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:22:24):**  it's not the most organized of youtube channels but it's extremely content rich if you put the  
**[1:22:30-1:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:22:30):**  time into it and on our facebook page at ridgedale permaculture so basically all things that i update  
**[1:22:39-1:22:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:22:39):**  people on are on there that's where you can find our book which is over at regenerativeagriculture.co  
**[1:22:46-1:22:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:22:46):**  we sell a pdf or the hard copy that we ship out from the farm every week day anywhere in the world  
**[1:22:53-1:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:22:53):**  and other all our other websites are totally being rebuilt and i'll be announcing that on our  
**[1:23:00-1:23:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:23:00):**  youtube channel and our facebook page as as and when they come out and the next thing that will  
**[1:23:05-1:23:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:23:05):**  be coming up is the farm like a hero experience that hopefully will kick off first of may and  
**[1:23:12-1:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:23:12):**  it'll be all over the internet i guess marvelous there you go well richard it was really a pleasure

### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 07 Aug 2020 08:40:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:00:09):**  You're in the right place for all things regenerative living, ecological restoration,  
**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:00:14):**  permaculture and natural building.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:00:16):**  I'm your host Oliver Gaucher.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:00:18):**  In this show, it's my job to interview leaders, innovators and rebels on the cutting edge  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:00:22):**  of their fields as we look for solutions to our generation's most urgent challenges  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:00:27):**  and share these techniques and information so that you can join us in creating a healthy  
**[0:00:31-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:00:31):**  and abundant world for everyone.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:00:33):**  So let's get started.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:00:40):**  You'd like to be self-sufficient, but the space you have available is tighter than your  
**[0:00:44-0:00:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:00:44):**  budget.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:00:45):**  If this sounds familiar, the Homegrown City Life Series was created just for you.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:00:50):**  Our authors bring country living to the city with big ideas for small spaces.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:00:54):**  Books include cheese making, fermenting, gardening, composting and more.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:00:59):**  Everything you need to create your own Homegrown City Life.

**[0:01:12-0:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:01:12):**  Without a doubt, the most important mission of our lifetimes will be regenerating this  
**[0:01:16-0:01:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:01:16):**  planet and creating a new culture based on care and stewardship for all life.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:01:22):**  But it can be hard to know where to start.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:01:24):**  After more than 150 episodes of speaking to leaders and innovators in the regenerative  
**[0:01:29-0:01:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:01:29):**  fields around the world, and working with clients and organizations to help them reach  
**[0:01:33-0:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:01:33):**  their regenerative goals, I've compiled many lists of essential skills and steps that  
**[0:01:38-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:01:38):**  anyone can take today to begin their journey towards a brighter future for themselves,  
**[0:01:42-0:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:01:42):**  their families and communities, and for the ecosystems that support them.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:01:46):**  Every two weeks, I'll send you a new regenerative skill that you can develop and expand on in  
**[0:01:51-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:01:51):**  your own life right away.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:01:52):**  What's more is that I'm creating a community of skill builders like you who are sharing  
**[0:01:57-0:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:01:57):**  their results and stories of success to inspire you towards greater action.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:02:01):**  You can sign up right now in the show notes for this episode or on the homepage at abundantedge.com.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:02:07):**  Start your week off right by building your skills for a regenerative future.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:02:11):**  Though this series on regenerative farming has covered a ton of different farming models,  
**[0:02:16-0:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:02:16):**  land management techniques, food production methods, and design methods, one of the glaring  
**[0:02:21-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:02:21):**  absences and the perspectives that I've included have been that of women, and I'm  
**[0:02:25-0:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:02:25):**  well aware of it.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:02:26):**  I did reach out to a lot of women farmers in an attempt to set up interviews, but many  
**[0:02:30-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:02:30):**  of them either didn't want to be interviewed or were simply too busy to be able to schedule  
**[0:02:34-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:02:34):**  a call.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:02:35):**  I can imagine with all this nonsense and instability around the pandemic, it must be really challenging  
**[0:02:40-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:02:40):**  for all farmers in the last six months.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:02:42):**  I was, however, finally able to get a hold of Lisa Kivrist, one of my favorite authors  
**[0:02:47-0:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:02:47):**  of homesteading skills and small-scale farming.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:02:50):**  She's the author of The Farmstead Chef, Rural Renaissance, Ecopreneuring, Homemade for Sale,  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:02:57):**  and the book that will be the center of our interview today, Soil Sisters, a toolkit for  
**[0:03:02-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:03:02):**  women farmers.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:03:03):**  She's also the host of the podcast In Her Boots, which focuses on interviews with and  
**[0:03:08-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:03:08):**  about modern women farmers, which I've been a fan of for over a year now and I highly  
**[0:03:11-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:03:11):**  recommend to anyone interested in farm stories and general advice for farming in the USA.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:03:17):**  In her extensive work helping to build support for women in farming and to create a community  
**[0:03:22-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:03:22):**  network of their peers that they can rely on, Lisa has helped to highlight the stories  
**[0:03:27-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:03:27):**  and experiences around the immeasurable contributions from women in agriculture and set stronger  
**[0:03:32-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:03:32):**  foundations for their continued success into the future.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:03:36):**  In this interview, Lisa helps me to understand the complex history of women farmers in the  
**[0:03:40-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:03:40):**  USA and the obstacles that they've had to overcome in the past as well as those that  
**[0:03:44-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:03:44):**  are still in their way.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:03:47):**  She also explains the unique talents and perspectives that they bring to this fast-changing sector,  
**[0:03:51-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:03:51):**  along with the growing support network that they're building together.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:03:54):**  Now, I've been a big fan of Lisa's books for a while and her podcast is a really valuable  
**[0:03:59-0:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:03:59):**  resource too, but this book Soil Sisters really opened my eyes to the blind spots that I've  
**[0:04:04-0:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:04:04):**  had and the farming industry at large has had to the essential role that women have  
**[0:04:08-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:04:08):**  played in advancing and strengthening farming through some of America's toughest times.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:04:13):**  But rather than fumbling through trying to explain it myself, I'll hand it over now to  
**[0:04:18-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:04:18):**  Lisa.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:04:19):**  Hey, Lisa, thanks so much for making the time to be with me today.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:04:22):**  I'm glad we finally caught each other.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:04:24):**  This has been in the works for a little while.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:04:25):**  How are you doing?  
**[0:04:26-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:04:26):**  I am good.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:04:27):**  Thanks for the invitation, Oliver.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:04:30):**  How are things going in Wisconsin?  
**[0:04:32-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:04:32):**  There've been a lot of shakeups in the economy and the way things operate in business.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:04:36):**  How are you adapting and how has life looked like on the ground over there?  
**[0:04:40-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:04:40):**  Yeah.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:04:41):**  Well, literally on the ground here on our farm in Serendipity, it's kind of like it  
**[0:04:47-0:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:04:47):**  always is in June in particular of abundance and growing and harvesting and all of that.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:04:55):**  It's an interesting time to be on rural homesteads because there's very...  
**[0:05:02-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:05:02):**  I find it very comforting and hopeful to have hands in the soil and have a lot of our seasonal  
**[0:05:09-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:05:09):**  patterns kick in while the rest of the world is going through so much and processing so  
**[0:05:16-0:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:05:16):**  much.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:05:19):**  It's a space that has always drawn me in as home and I'm appreciating that in new ways  
**[0:05:25-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:05:25):**  this season.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:05:26):**  So yeah, yeah, but our community here in Wisconsin of farmers and our community, community sustainability,  
**[0:05:39-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:05:39):**  it's different.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:05:40):**  We haven't seen each other, which is a big part of our lifestyle around here of potlucks  
**[0:05:46-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:05:46):**  and gatherings and getting together.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:05:48):**  So that's been a definite change.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:05:50):**  So I think we've all been hunkering down more on our land this season and planting more  
**[0:05:55-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:05:55):**  and doing more because we're here and we can and we figure wherever things land, people  
**[0:06:01-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:06:01):**  always need food.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:06:02):**  They also always need that so we can always do more in that sense.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:06:05):**  Certainly.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:06:06):**  And it seems like you found that the working with the land and seeing the seasons change  
**[0:06:11-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:06:11):**  is like a constant, an anchor that gives a little bit of stability to all the craziness  
**[0:06:17-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:06:17):**  that's going around.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:06:18):**  I mean, I used to live and work on farms and now that I'm in an apartment, I really am  
**[0:06:22-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:06:22):**  finding that my connection with the garden that we have has been the consistent kind  
**[0:06:27-0:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:06:27):**  of comforting aspect as so many things are changing right now.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:06:31):**  Oh, you are so right.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:06:33):**  I never really fully appreciated it until now in that there's just a lot of hope in  
**[0:06:41-0:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:06:41):**  those routines.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:06:43):**  And we know that there are some things that are constant.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:06:46):**  And again, being June right now here, it's just our month of joy and solstice fun and  
**[0:06:53-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:06:53):**  everything is green and beautiful.  
**[0:06:55-0:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:06:55):**  And the weeds haven't kicked in and the dryness of late summer hasn't kicked in and everything  
**[0:06:59-0:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:06:59):**  is abundant.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:07:00):**  So it's a good time.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:07:03):**  It's a good time to again be rooted on the farm, but it's definitely one for the history  
**[0:07:10-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:07:10):**  books.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:07:11):**  For sure.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:07:12):**  Now with all this talk about the work that you're doing on the ground, I know you wear  
**[0:07:15-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:07:15):**  a lot of different hats from running an award-winning bed and breakfast on your small farm to working  
**[0:07:21-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:07:21):**  and coordinating various nonprofits.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:07:24):**  You also have a wonderful podcast called In Her Boots and you work to amplify voices of  
**[0:07:29-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:07:29):**  women farmers, but I know that this isn't how you grew up.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:07:33):**  Tell me about how your passion for farming began and how you sort of made a transition  
**[0:07:37-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:07:37):**  into rural living.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:07:39):**  Sure.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:07:40):**  That's been quite the journey as life takes us.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:07:43):**  So yeah, I did not grow up with a farming background, family, anything like that.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:07:49):**  Both myself and my husband, John Ivanco, grew up in the suburbs.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:07:54):**  I was outside of Chicago.  
**[0:07:56-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:07:56):**  He was outside of Detroit.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:07:57):**  So our story started in perhaps very typical roots in the sense of suburban kids growing  
**[0:08:06-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:08:06):**  up.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:08:07):**  I'm a first generation American.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:08:09):**  My parents immigrated and I grew up in a family that was very dedicated to food, if you will.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:08:20):**  We loved gatherings.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:08:22):**  We loved cooking.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:08:23):**  We had small gardens, but not the farming side, but that said where my parents were  
**[0:08:30-0:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:08:30):**  from, immigrating from the Baltics, my mom's from Latvia, my dad's from Estonia.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:08:37):**  And I'm one generation removed, as I say, from fully self-sufficient homesteading because  
**[0:08:44-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:08:44):**  when my parents grew up in the 20s and 30s back in the homeland, it was very common and  
**[0:08:51-0:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:08:51):**  everybody had full gardens and were growing wheat in their front lawn and had pigs in  
**[0:08:56-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:08:56):**  their backyard.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:08:57):**  It was just a way of life that I think very much ingrained in me of that sense of self-sufficiency  
**[0:09:03-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:09:03):**  and creative frugality and all of that.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:09:06):**  But that said, my life track was very typical in that I went to school, I went to college,  
**[0:09:10-0:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:09:10):**  and what do you do after college?  
**[0:09:11-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:09:11):**  You get a job, right?  
**[0:09:12-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:09:12):**  So that's what I was tracked to do and worked in Chicago in the corporate advertising world  
**[0:09:18-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:09:18):**  fairly briefly.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:09:19):**  And it was probably one or two years in and that's where John and I met that we might  
**[0:09:22-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:09:22):**  have had our early midlife crises in our mid-20s, but realizing this is just not for us and  
**[0:09:28-0:09:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:09:28):**  not having a clear picture of what was next, but doing what a lot of folks do of just getting  
**[0:09:33-0:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:09:33):**  out of the city.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:09:34):**  And we did typical camping, biking stuff, heading over the border north to Wisconsin  
**[0:09:38-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:09:38):**  from Chicago, as a lot of folks do.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:09:41):**  And something really started to spark for us there of being in a rural environment,  
**[0:09:45-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:09:45):**  being a place with space, wanting more independence from the job that we found very draining to  
**[0:09:54-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:09:54):**  wanting to contribute more to the earth and our world and to be responsible and be able  
**[0:10:01-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:10:01):**  to act in a way that was treading lighter on our world.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:10:04):**  So that's where some seeds were planted, but it was very, very new for me, Oliver.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:10:11):**  My own family is still somewhat digesting of where I ended up, but for me, it was a  
**[0:10:16-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:10:16):**  very natural fit and very much a journey.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:10:19):**  So anyway, that sparked the, hmm, could we live somewhere else?  
**[0:10:22-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:10:22):**  And this was back in the mid-90s where things like the internet, hard to believe, were really  
**[0:10:29-0:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:10:29):**  just percolating as, oh, look at this.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:10:32):**  But even then you could tell that this was going to be a game changer of the ability  
**[0:10:35-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:10:35):**  to work from wherever you want it to be and have a lot more freedom.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:10:40):**  So we started thinking, well, let's give it a try.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:10:44):**  And that was too a little bit at the time where we could pay off our student loans relatively  
**[0:10:50-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:10:50):**  efficiently in a couple of years so we could start debt-free and keep that mantra of how  
**[0:10:55-0:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:10:55):**  can we live as lean as possible and live closer to the land.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:10:58):**  And that's what brought us in 1996 now to our five acres here in Southwest Wisconsin  
**[0:11:05-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:11:05):**  in Serendipity.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:11:06):**  So we are not on a lot of land, but we've learned you can do a lot on whatever you have.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:11:13):**  And our journey has been a little different from the start in that, well, one thing is  
**[0:11:18-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:11:18):**  obvious but worth saying is we didn't come with farming experience, which I don't know  
**[0:11:22-0:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:11:22):**  if I necessarily recommend, but in our case, we were so frustrated with those jobs and  
**[0:11:27-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:11:27):**  we took some time off to travel as I know you would recommend, end up getting out and  
**[0:11:32-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:11:32):**  seeing things around the world and came back committed to the rural lifestyle.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:11:38):**  And knowing that we didn't have the farming experience or that we could just start pumping  
**[0:11:42-0:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:11:42):**  out those bountiful fresh tomatoes, we knew we needed to be diversified.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:11:46):**  So our goal has always been from the farmstead to generate our income on farm, but not necessarily  
**[0:11:52-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:11:52):**  all through farming, which has kept us diversified and creative in that sense, both like starting  
**[0:11:57-0:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:11:57):**  the bed and breakfast from the start to doing writing, to working, as you mentioned, with  
**[0:12:02-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:12:02):**  other nonprofits and things.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:12:03):**  So it's a pretty diversified income portfolio, but under that umbrella of living very lean  
**[0:12:09-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:12:09):**  and generating our own food, generating our own power, we run on renewable energy.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:12:14):**  So minimizing expenses as much as possible so that we have that freedom to pursue what  
**[0:12:20-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:12:20):**  we'd like to do.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:12:21):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:12:22):**  It's such a wonderful story of making that transition and finding success within it while  
**[0:12:28-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:12:28):**  still maintaining that connection to the commerce and using the education that you got from  
**[0:12:35-0:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:12:35):**  the city.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:12:36):**  It's not one or the other.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:12:37):**  You don't have to abandon everything to go into this type of lifestyle.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:12:42):**  And moving on from there, I kind of want to focus now on the work that you have done to  
**[0:12:47-0:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:12:47):**  help to highlight and promote and empower women in the farming sector specifically.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:12:53):**  And I'm sure that this was somewhat developed as you had to learn so many of these things  
**[0:12:57-0:13:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:12:57):**  from scratch and didn't have as many resources and probably found that it's a much more difficult  
**[0:13:03-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:13:03):**  journey for women, particularly getting into this.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:13:06):**  But before we go into the work that you've done specifically, could you give us a very  
**[0:13:12-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:13:12):**  brief history of women in agriculture in the US that you sort of outlined in your book  
**[0:13:18-0:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:13:18):**  Soil Sisters?  
**[0:13:19-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:13:19):**  Sure.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:13:20):**  So it's almost funny when we talk about it in that this whole idea of women farming and  
**[0:13:28-0:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:13:28):**  being almost a trendy thing now where women have been growing food and feeding their families  
**[0:13:35-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:13:35):**  and communities since the dawn of agriculture.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:13:38):**  This has been going on for hundreds, thousands of years of women producing food.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:13:44):**  But even in the United States, even if we just look at the last hundred years, the short  
**[0:13:49-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:13:49):**  story is women have not been recognized politically or economically for our contributions to the  
**[0:13:57-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:13:57):**  farm and to the food production system.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:13:59):**  And that's what has in a good way, rapidly changed, particularly in the last couple of  
**[0:14:03-0:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:14:03):**  decades.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:14:04):**  So we need to appreciate and I appreciate the question because we need to appreciate  
**[0:14:08-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:14:08):**  our history of where we came from to understand where we need to go.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:14:11):**  So even if we look at the last hundred years in the United States, if you start like in  
**[0:14:18-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:14:18):**  the World War I era where women were self organizing of the women's land army, and these  
**[0:14:24-0:14:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:14:24):**  were women who were basically stepping in to take the jobs that men had left to fight  
**[0:14:31-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:14:31):**  in World War I and go overseas and leave, but these were women stepping into the fields,  
**[0:14:37-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:14:37):**  stepping into the canneries, the fisheries and taking on those jobs quite successfully,  
**[0:14:42-0:14:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:14:42):**  I might add.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:14:43):**  And that was really one of the first movements of women organizing around agriculture in  
**[0:14:49-0:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:14:49):**  the States.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:14:50):**  And then it's kind of as history goes, right?  
**[0:14:52-0:14:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:14:52):**  Two steps forward, one step back, three steps back.  
**[0:14:55-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:14:55):**  It's a dance.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:14:56):**  And what happened after World War I is that women, it became very patriotic to give those  
**[0:15:01-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:15:01):**  jobs back to the men who had left.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:15:03):**  So it was kind of a moment, but it proved that women can organize around these things  
**[0:15:07-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:15:07):**  that it actually inspired in World War II, the victory garden movement of, in this case,  
**[0:15:13-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:15:13):**  the government organizing an initiative to raise more food at home so that we would be  
**[0:15:19-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:15:19):**  more self-sufficient.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:15:21):**  And that was very much inspired by the women's land army and the fact that we can do these  
**[0:15:24-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:15:24):**  things and that we can grow and raise more things in our home front and talk about Homeland  
**[0:15:32-0:15:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:15:32):**  Security there, right?  
**[0:15:34-0:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:15:34):**  So yeah, at the peak of World War II and the victory garden movement that we were raising  
**[0:15:39-0:15:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:15:39):**  over 40% of our domestic produce in home gardens.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:15:42):**  And talk about again, security with that.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:15:45):**  And interesting prior to World War II during the great depression here in the 1930s, in  
**[0:15:51-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:15:51):**  like the mid thirties, it was estimated that like the majority of a farm's income was coming  
**[0:15:59-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:15:59):**  from eggs and produce at local markets.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:16:05):**  Now arguably that was coming from the women raising these things.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:16:08):**  And that doesn't even include things like crafts or baked goods or other items.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:16:14):**  So one could even argue that it was the women and what they were doing economically that  
**[0:16:18-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:16:18):**  got the rural areas in our country through the depression because of what we were doing  
**[0:16:22-0:16:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:16:22):**  on the farm homestead.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:16:24):**  So back to World War II and post World War II and what happens in a nutshell as we get  
**[0:16:29-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:16:29):**  bigger is better, right?  
**[0:16:30-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:16:30):**  And oh, we were growing more things during the victory garden era during World War II,  
**[0:16:35-0:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:16:35):**  but that was sacrifice, or at least that's how the media and the government built it,  
**[0:16:39-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:16:39):**  right?  
**[0:16:40-0:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:16:40):**  And now we have processed food and industrialized agriculture and bigger, better, cheaper.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:16:45):**  And there we went.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:16:47):**  And here we are as a result of that, but women lost a place in agriculture as things got  
**[0:16:53-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:16:53):**  bigger and more mechanized and none of the mechanical equipment being designed for a  
**[0:16:58-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:16:58):**  woman's body ergonomically.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:17:00):**  And we can talk more about that.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:17:02):**  But, but also to interest, we liked having our hands in the soil, we liked having that  
**[0:17:07-0:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:17:07):**  lifestyle that wasn't reflected in the big combine.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:17:10):**  So women took on different roles in many farming families, it might have been more bookkeeping  
**[0:17:14-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:17:14):**  or other, but still were not economically recognized for that work.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:17:19):**  And then in the 70s, in a nutshell, things started to change.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:17:24):**  Women started to be counted economically from a policy perspective.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:17:29):**  And this has to do with things that finally changed.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:17:32):**  For example, that if a woman was widowed or divorced in a farm, that she would have property  
**[0:17:37-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:17:37):**  rights.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:17:39):**  And those things didn't really exist till that time, which people still find shocking.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:17:42):**  It wasn't that long ago.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:17:44):**  But once women started being recognized and validated economically for their farming contributions,  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:17:51):**  and too, once the census started counting women, because again, historically, in the  
**[0:17:56-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:17:56):**  census of agriculture, which is a super important census that basically goes out every five  
**[0:18:02-0:18:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:18:02):**  years to farms in the United States that tracks who's farming, how many farmers, what are  
**[0:18:08-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:18:08):**  we growing, etc.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:18:09):**  And it's that data from the ag census that builds the farm bill and builds policy and  
**[0:18:14-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:18:14):**  importantly allocates dollars.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:18:17):**  But there was one place on the ag census for farm owner and that typically went to the  
**[0:18:22-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:18:22):**  male head of household.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:18:23):**  So that started changing.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:18:25):**  And I give the USDA and the ag census folks credit to recognize it's not just women we're  
**[0:18:31-0:18:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:18:31):**  talking about, but it is recognizing that we have increasing diversity in our agricultural  
**[0:18:37-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:18:37):**  workforce and our agricultural system.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:18:39):**  And our ag census and importantly, our policy and our funding needs to reflect that.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:18:43):**  So the last ag census that just came out, I think there were seven spots for primary  
**[0:18:49-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:18:49):**  owner of a farm and that reflects a lot of things, you know, farm families, siblings  
**[0:18:53-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:18:53):**  farming together and recognizing people for their work.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:18:57):**  So so all of that adds up to today where you see women is one of the fastest growing groups  
**[0:19:04-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:19:04):**  of new farmers.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:19:06):**  Women are still classified as what's called socially disadvantaged farmer group.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:19:12):**  Sometimes that's called historically underserved by the USDA.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:19:16):**  And that has to do with as a result of this history I've been describing of discrimination,  
**[0:19:21-0:19:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:19:21):**  particularly in farm loans through the FSA through the Farm Service Agency, where women  
**[0:19:26-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:19:26):**  have been denied loans based on gender.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:19:30):**  So there are different ways to string that that we can talk about for new women farmers  
**[0:19:36-0:19:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:19:36):**  who are looking for loans, that there might be some opportunity there.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:19:40):**  But I'm hoping that because of all the good work being done by women farmers today and  
**[0:19:44-0:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:19:44):**  folks like yourself spreading these stories that eventually we won't have that status  
**[0:19:47-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:19:47):**  and we will be fully economically and politically present in the driving of our agricultural  
**[0:19:56-0:19:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:19:56):**  system here, but we still have work to do.  
**[0:19:58-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:19:58):**  Certainly.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:19:59):**  Well, it was really well explained, Lisa.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:20:01):**  But tell me where we're at now and some of the obstacles that still exist, even though  
**[0:20:06-0:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:20:06):**  women, like you said, are one of the fastest growing groups in farming.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:20:10):**  Certainly it's not as easy and things still are not necessarily designed for their success  
**[0:20:15-0:20:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:20:15):**  right now.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:20:16):**  You're exactly right.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:20:18):**  And a lot of the things that women find as barriers are not female exclusive.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:20:23):**  They have to do with all sorts of new farmer groups and particularly minority farmer groups  
**[0:20:28-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:20:28):**  that don't have access to capital, for example, for land access, that sort of thing.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:20:33):**  But specific to women is I mentioned briefly before is the ergonomic issue and the fact  
**[0:20:39-0:20:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:20:39):**  that tools, machinery are not designed for a woman's body.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:20:46):**  And we all know basic biology of, yeah, there's difference between male and female, but there  
**[0:20:51-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:20:51):**  are body differences.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:20:53):**  And this is not a question of whatever, right, wrong, strong, weak.  
**[0:20:57-0:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:20:57):**  It's just we're different.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:20:58):**  Women carry their strength, for example, in their lower half of their body than their  
**[0:21:02-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:21:02):**  upper half.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:21:03):**  Whereas men are the opposite, tend to be stronger on their upper half versus lower.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:21:07):**  Women tend to be shorter than men.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:21:09):**  And those things add up to a huge issue when it comes to farming on the equipment side,  
**[0:21:16-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:21:16):**  both from a safety perspective, because if you're operating particularly mechanized equipment  
**[0:21:23-0:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:21:23):**  or any equipment really, but it's not safe, right?  
**[0:21:26-0:21:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:21:26):**  And you see farm injuries and you see the potential for that risk much higher for women  
**[0:21:32-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:21:32):**  who are basically trying to wear a pair of shoes that don't fit them.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:21:36):**  And then also too, you look at the long-term health of staying active in farming.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:21:41):**  And for all of us, our most important tool is ourselves, our body.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:21:45):**  And if we aren't being able to operate ergonomically safely and positively, if things are too short,  
**[0:21:54-0:21:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:21:54):**  too long, whatever, not built for us, then that adds up as well.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:21:57):**  So you see a lot of creativity as the result of that, of women adapting tools.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:22:04):**  You see new startups who are trying to help with this too.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:22:08):**  One of the women I write about in the Soul Sisters books is Liz Bresdinger and Ann Adams,  
**[0:22:14-0:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:22:14):**  who started Green Heron Tools out in Pennsylvania.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:22:19):**  And to backtrack, they actually originally started a farm, the Green Heron Farm.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:22:24):**  And one of their sons at the time was a chef in Philadelphia.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:22:29):**  And this was pre the bustling local food movement of today.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:22:34):**  And he couldn't find access to fresh produce.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:22:36):**  And any mom would know if your son needs something, you want to help him, right?  
**[0:22:40-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:22:40):**  So she started a farm and those two friends together started Green Heron Farms.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:22:44):**  And they were loving the farming side and they were in their 50s at the time.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:22:47):**  So it wasn't a physical issue, but they could just, that they couldn't handle it.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:22:52):**  They were physically fit, but they could just see that these tools weren't right for them  
**[0:22:56-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:22:56):**  and that they were feeling aches and pains that could grow into bigger issues.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:23:00):**  So they started thinking, all right, well, we probably are not the only women farmers  
**[0:23:03-0:23:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:23:03):**  with these problems.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:23:04):**  Why don't we find all the tools designed for women farmers and we'll put them in a catalog  
**[0:23:08-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:23:08):**  so other people can access them?  
**[0:23:11-0:23:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:23:11):**  Great idea.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:23:12):**  They did their research, except they found there was literally nothing, nothing that  
**[0:23:17-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:23:17):**  was designed ergonomically for them.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:23:18):**  And I've granted there was some gardening tools that were cute or feminine or painted  
**[0:23:24-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:23:24):**  pink and that is now what we're talking about here.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:23:27):**  That's more condescending than anything.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:23:29):**  Yes, exactly.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:23:31):**  And so they pivoted and said, wait a minute, there's something here and started Green Heron  
**[0:23:37-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:23:37):**  tools where they have been developing, you know, much larger research capacity, working  
**[0:23:43-0:23:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:23:43):**  with Penn State and doing focus groups with farmers and various ergonomic tests to find  
**[0:23:49-0:23:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:23:49):**  out what we want and find out how they can design it.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:23:53):**  And not surprisingly, what we really didn't want was like a tractor or large equipment  
**[0:23:59-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:23:59):**  designed for women.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:24:00):**  We want to have our hands in the soil.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:24:01):**  And the thing we really wanted was a shovel that would work.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:24:05):**  And they came out with a couple of years now of a, it's called the her shovel, which is  
**[0:24:10-0:24:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:24:10):**  ergonomically designed for women.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:24:12):**  And it comes in three sizes because we come in different sizes and things like they found  
**[0:24:18-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:24:18):**  in their research that when a male uses a shovel, he will tend to dig straight down.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:24:23):**  Whereas a woman will tend to dig at an angle.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:24:26):**  Again, it's not a right wrong thing.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:24:28):**  It's just differences.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:24:29):**  But the shovel is designed for that versus trying to fight it the other way.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:24:34):**  So it interesting.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:24:35):**  We're all about serendipity here.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:24:37):**  Our farm is in serendipity and sometimes often in our life journey, right?  
**[0:24:42-0:24:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:24:42):**  I think you want to test this Oliver with all the places you've been and things you've  
**[0:24:46-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:24:46):**  done that you just have to sometimes get out there and you don't know what you will encounter  
**[0:24:50-0:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:24:50):**  until you start.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:24:51):**  And so they named their farm Green Heron Farm because when they first saw the land, there  
**[0:24:57-0:24:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:24:57):**  was a pond and there was a green heron.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:24:59):**  And it was this beautiful romantic farm moment, right?  
**[0:25:01-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:25:01):**  But it turns out that a green heron, the bird is one of the few birds that actually uses  
**[0:25:07-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:25:07):**  its beak as a tool.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:25:09):**  So talk about foreshadowing.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:25:10):**  They had the perfect name for this pivot.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:25:14):**  But I share that because when we talk about these challenges of women farmers or any farmer  
**[0:25:20-0:25:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:25:20):**  group, they really are opportunities for people to start up new businesses, to take charge,  
**[0:25:28-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:25:28):**  to solve problems.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:25:30):**  And if there's problems that you as a farmer encounter yourself, hands down, there will  
**[0:25:35-0:25:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:25:35):**  be other farmers having that same barrier.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:25:38):**  And it may lead you in another direction like the green heron tools women, but it may be  
**[0:25:43-0:25:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:25:43):**  something on a much bigger level that can help sustain our sustainability movement.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:25:50):**  Yes, certainly.  
**[0:25:52-0:26:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:25:52):**  And I mean, making the barriers that much easier to overcome and offering tools and  
**[0:26:00-0:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:26:00):**  information is going to probably be the make or break factor for so many people who, like  
**[0:26:07-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:26:07):**  you said, are just starting in on this.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:26:09):**  And that brings me back to your book Soil Sisters, which from my impression of reading  
**[0:26:13-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:26:13):**  it is really a mentorship in written form for women who are either getting started or  
**[0:26:18-0:26:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:26:18):**  getting better established in agriculture.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:26:22):**  But this wasn't around when you got started.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:26:24):**  So where did you turn to when you were getting established yourself and who helped you to  
**[0:26:30-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:26:30):**  build the knowledge that you have now?  
**[0:26:33-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:26:33):**  You nailed it there with the focus of the book, Oliver.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:26:35):**  I appreciate that because it very much is mentorship and collaboration.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:26:40):**  And you're right to that when I started, there weren't resources period for, well, beginning  
**[0:26:49-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:26:49):**  homesteaders beginning farmers, the internet was just coming of age, things are so much  
**[0:26:54-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:26:54):**  more ripe and delicious on that front now.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:26:56):**  But it was talking to other people, and in my case, talking to other women.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:27:01):**  And that collaboration that really helped both from a pure informational perspective,  
**[0:27:07-0:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:27:07):**  how do I do?  
**[0:27:08-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:27:08):**  Why?  
**[0:27:09-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:27:09):**  How do I battle ex pest in the growing fields, but also support that you can do this and  
**[0:27:15-0:27:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:27:15):**  that there are a lot of ways to do this.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:27:17):**  And most importantly, people, other women have your back when you're doing it.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:27:22):**  So it was because that we have been lacking these resources.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:27:27):**  And when you look particularly at women in the sustainable ag and organic community,  
**[0:27:32-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:27:32):**  the resources are even smaller that really target how we want to approach things and  
**[0:27:38-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:27:38):**  really looking at things holistically and from that diversification aspect.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:27:43):**  So my own experience was exactly what stemmed into the Soul Sisters book of talking to and  
**[0:27:49-0:27:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:27:49):**  connecting with other women.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:27:51):**  And that is what eventually evolved to the book of over a hundred women contributing  
**[0:27:55-0:28:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:27:55):**  their ideas and resources and inspiration.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:28:00):**  And the research has shown that women, that's our preferred learning style is learning from  
**[0:28:05-0:28:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:28:05):**  each other, which goes in direct contrast with traditional education, where you have  
**[0:28:11-0:28:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:28:11):**  a classroom and somebody typically male is at the front of the classroom lecturing on  
**[0:28:18-0:28:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:28:18):**  how this is done.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:28:19):**  That's not how we work best as women.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:28:23):**  And in my work in women in agriculture and in the programming I've been involved with,  
**[0:28:28-0:28:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:28:28):**  we very much try to celebrate that and do things differently.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:28:33):**  So you won't see unless I can help it or rearranging chairs all the time, you know, because the  
**[0:28:39-0:28:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:28:39):**  lecture classroom format doesn't work.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:28:41):**  We like circles.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:28:42):**  We like learning circles and trying to always approach agricultural education for women  
**[0:28:48-0:28:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:28:48):**  from the lens that we are all on this journey together and whether this is the first Ag  
**[0:28:53-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:28:53):**  event you've ever attended or you've been farming 20 plus years, we have something to  
**[0:28:57-0:28:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:28:57):**  learn from each other.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:28:58):**  So really trying to foster that spirit has been a focus of my writing and work and very  
**[0:29:04-0:29:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:29:04):**  much in the Soul Sisters book and something I am personally very grateful for because  
**[0:29:09-0:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:29:09):**  I have met so many amazing women along the way.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:29:12):**  And when I was telling that brief synopsis of the history of women in Ag, it's easy to  
**[0:29:19-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:29:19):**  flash forward to today, but there have been so many amazing women who started 20, 30 years  
**[0:29:24-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:29:24):**  ago, 40 years ago when the organic community was such a renegade offshoot group and the  
**[0:29:33-0:29:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:29:33):**  ideas of CSAs and community supported agriculture were just being birthed that were true pioneers  
**[0:29:40-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:29:40):**  from my perspective who really laid the groundwork for where we are today.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:29:46):**  We're just things are much more, I wouldn't even say accepted, but celebrated for women  
**[0:29:51-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:29:51):**  in agriculture.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:29:52):**  And it's really honoring those pioneers.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:29:55):**  And there's several stories in the book, one of which Denise O'Brien is a wonderful friend  
**[0:30:00-0:30:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:30:00):**  and mentor of mine.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:30:01):**  She was one of these, again, organic women pioneers farming with her husband in Western  
**[0:30:07-0:30:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:30:07):**  Iowa for years and it was back in the 80s when that farming crisis was happening and  
**[0:30:13-0:30:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:30:13):**  they were going to local meetings and organizing and talking to their neighbors and she very  
**[0:30:18-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:30:18):**  much saw a gender split where the men were in one side of the room and the women were  
**[0:30:22-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:30:22):**  in the other side of the room and the conversations were different and the conversations she heard  
**[0:30:27-0:30:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:30:27):**  amongst the women were, you know, I kind of saw this coming and maybe we should have diversified,  
**[0:30:32-0:30:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:30:32):**  maybe we should have done some other things and more importantly, Denise saw that those  
**[0:30:37-0:30:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:30:37):**  voices of these women were not at the table.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:30:40):**  They were not at the decision making table.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:30:42):**  And how could she help?  
**[0:30:43-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:30:43):**  She felt very compelled to change that.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:30:45):**  So here she was, experienced but really stepping to that leadership plate and she started the  
**[0:30:51-0:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:30:51):**  Women, Food and Ag Network or WEFAN, which is still going strong today and is really  
**[0:30:58-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:30:58):**  a national network of women, both farmers but educators, activists, women committed  
**[0:31:03-0:31:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:31:03):**  to sustainable and organic agriculture.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:31:06):**  So I share that story too because if we see, it's one thing to see practical tools and  
**[0:31:11-0:31:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:31:11):**  things that we need, yes, we need those, but it's also the bigger, broader issues for women  
**[0:31:15-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:31:15):**  to organize around and step up more to the leadership plate, be it starting your own  
**[0:31:20-0:31:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:31:20):**  organization like Denise or fortunately, even here in my local farmhood, we increasingly  
**[0:31:25-0:31:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:31:25):**  see women with agricultural backgrounds running for office and that's a huge game changer  
**[0:31:31-0:31:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:31:31):**  to get more of these voices at the true decision making table.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:31:37):**  That's super exciting and I'm so glad to hear that this is starting to gain momentum.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:31:44):**  If I could, I want to kind of note off a little excerpt from your book, which hit me personally  
**[0:31:49-0:31:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:31:49):**  because it so succinctly kind of describes where we're at right now.  
**[0:31:55-0:32:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:31:55):**  And you write that there are nearly 1 million farmers today representing about 30% of all  
**[0:32:01-0:32:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:32:01):**  farms being women and together you add up over 12 billion in annual sales of farm products.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:32:09):**  Your numbers have nearly doubled in the last 25 years.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:32:12):**  My question from this would be, what do you think right now is attracting more women into  
**[0:32:16-0:32:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:32:16):**  farming as a livelihood and lifestyle at this very unique moment in history when it's so  
**[0:32:23-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:32:23):**  crucial for us to reconnect with the land and our food systems?  
**[0:32:27-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:32:27):**  Right.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:32:30):**  That's interesting because I think, well, it kind of depends on what lens you're coming  
**[0:32:36-0:32:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:32:36):**  from.  
**[0:32:37-0:32:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:32:37):**  I see women who have grown up on farms and were often the first to want to leave and  
**[0:32:43-0:32:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:32:43):**  might have had careers in completely other things, but then are drawn back and bring  
**[0:32:48-0:32:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:32:48):**  that perspective of wanting to reinvent and recreate and steward the land they grew up  
**[0:32:54-0:32:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:32:54):**  on.  
**[0:32:55-0:33:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:32:55):**  And then you have women like myself who did not grow up in that environment, but really  
**[0:33:00-0:33:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:33:00):**  feel this kinship as an adult to the soil, to the food system, to that self-sufficiency.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:33:06):**  I mean, I joke about it, but I think too, there were just a lot of women like me who  
**[0:33:11-0:33:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:33:11):**  grew up with Little House on the Prairie and those images and that idea of pioneering in  
**[0:33:17-0:33:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:33:17):**  the homestead that really struck in our heart that got glossed over as adulthood came in,  
**[0:33:22-0:33:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:33:22):**  right?  
**[0:33:23-0:33:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:33:23):**  I mean, it was a good job and a real career and, and, and, but much of my lifestyle goes  
**[0:33:28-0:33:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:33:28):**  back to those things I was drawn to as a child.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:33:31):**  So there's definitely that too, interestingly, and this fascinates me is, and I write about  
**[0:33:36-0:33:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:33:36):**  it and still sisters didn't call it, women who are heading into their Encore career.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:33:42):**  And these are women midlife who are starting farms, not maybe returning to a family farm,  
**[0:33:46-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:33:46):**  but often it's not.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:33:48):**  And that is super powerful.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:33:50):**  The Encore farm name came up, thanks to a friend letting me borrow it of Paula Foreman.  
**[0:33:57-0:34:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:33:57):**  She's a kind of almost urban, peri-urban farmer outside the Twin Cities, but she literally  
**[0:34:02-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:34:02):**  woke up on her 50th day a couple of years ago and said, you know, if I'm ever going  
**[0:34:07-0:34:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:34:07):**  to start this farm and follow the stream, I have to do it now, or it's going to be too  
**[0:34:11-0:34:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:34:11):**  late.  
**[0:34:12-0:34:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:34:12):**  And so she started her farm, that Encore farm for that reason as an Encore career.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:34:17):**  And women starting these farms bring life experience, and it could be a variety of backgrounds  
**[0:34:25-0:34:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:34:25):**  or from corporate marketing to healthcare to others.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:34:29):**  So they're bringing a new different skill set to agriculture that can really, I think,  
**[0:34:35-0:34:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:34:35):**  help things evolve and definitely can help their business start up smartly because yeah,  
**[0:34:42-0:34:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:34:42):**  it's going to be different when you're 50 versus 25.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:34:44):**  And also too, if you see yourself farming into your senior years in different capacities,  
**[0:34:50-0:34:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:34:50):**  what does that mean?  
**[0:34:51-0:34:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:34:51):**  So Paula is a great example.  
**[0:34:52-0:34:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:34:52):**  So but then again, let me share, we were talking about serendipity.  
**[0:34:57-0:35:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:34:57):**  You need to keep that balance of the practical, right, and the research and reality with the  
**[0:35:03-0:35:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:35:03):**  heart and the soul and what just draws you.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:35:06):**  So she, as we are, those beautiful, juicy, delicious, glossy seed catalogs in the winter,  
**[0:35:13-0:35:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:35:13):**  right, you know, in December, January, and they get us all buzzed about spring.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:35:18):**  So when she had made this decision, she got her catalog from Seed Savers, that's nonprofit  
**[0:35:25-0:35:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:35:25):**  in Iowa that does a lot in seed saving, and they have a lot of heirloom bean seeds.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:35:30):**  And on the cover of the catalog she received were these heirloom beans, dried beans.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:35:37):**  And she just found a picture, but she's like, I can do dried beans.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:35:42):**  She's worked in the restaurant circuit for a lot of chefs in the Twin Cities areas who  
**[0:35:47-0:35:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:35:47):**  really appreciate local food, but the barrier we have is the winter, right, and not having  
**[0:35:52-0:35:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:35:52):**  access.  
**[0:35:53-0:35:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:35:53):**  So having a non-perishable product would really go over well, she thought, and it's something  
**[0:35:58-0:36:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:35:58):**  that she could handle on her own as a single solo farmer, and could do without a whole  
**[0:36:05-0:36:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:36:05):**  lot of mechanization, etc.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:36:08):**  And the other, she's been quite successful.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:36:12):**  So it's interesting to see the life, getting things based on a patchwork of ideas and experiences,  
**[0:36:23-0:36:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:36:23):**  but taking things in new ways.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:36:26):**  So to your question, there's a wide diversity of women and their stories they're bringing  
**[0:36:32-0:36:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:36:32):**  to agriculture, but we really come together and hence the Soil Sisters name of a commitment  
**[0:36:38-0:36:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:36:38):**  to land stewardship and healthy soil, and a commitment to each other and championing  
**[0:36:45-0:36:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:36:45):**  diversity in our food system, be it women, increasing the platform from women from different  
**[0:36:50-0:36:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:36:50):**  communities, from communities of color, from urban, rural, all of us having a say in where  
**[0:36:56-0:37:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:36:56):**  things are going, and importantly, having a say in our local communities, food access.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:37:03):**  I gotta say, Lisa, that's one of the aspects of your work that I most admire is your efforts  
**[0:37:08-0:37:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:37:08):**  at creating such a close knit community and such a supportive community of women farmers  
**[0:37:15-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:37:15):**  all around the country, but especially in your region of the upper Midwest.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:37:19):**  And that's something that I definitely want to reach out to you again in the future to  
**[0:37:22-0:37:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:37:22):**  kind of help the coach and guide me on as I try and create these resources to do the  
**[0:37:27-0:37:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:37:27):**  same thing for my local area.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:37:29):**  But you also put out some great resources on helping to coach women through taking on  
**[0:37:37-0:37:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:37:37):**  more active leadership roles in their community, on their farms, and can you tell me a little  
**[0:37:42-0:37:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:37:42):**  bit about your resources for amplifying our Voices Toolkit for women farmers that you've  
**[0:37:48-0:37:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:37:48):**  helped to produce?  
**[0:37:50-0:37:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:37:50):**  Oh, sure.  
**[0:37:51-0:37:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:37:51):**  That's a fairly new project we just launched, Redeering the Countryside, that is a Minnesota  
**[0:37:56-0:38:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:37:56):**  based nonprofit I work a lot with that does a variety of cool activities and educational  
**[0:38:02-0:38:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:38:02):**  outreach under the rural revitalization umbrella of keeping vibrancy in our rural areas and  
**[0:38:09-0:38:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:38:09):**  building on that.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:38:10):**  And we were finding that we want what we want to see and we needed to see more women farmers  
**[0:38:17-0:38:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:38:17):**  with a sustainable and organic perspective in the media, sharing these stories and sharing  
**[0:38:21-0:38:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:38:21):**  them authentically and that that would be a good driver for public awareness and eventually  
**[0:38:26-0:38:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:38:26):**  policy change.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:38:28):**  So with support and gratitude from Organic Valley Family of Farms, which is a cooperative  
**[0:38:34-0:38:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:38:34):**  of organic farmers, the largest organic cooperative in the country based here in Wisconsin, we  
**[0:38:39-0:38:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:38:39):**  created this free toolkit that you can find on the Renewing the Countryside site for women  
**[0:38:44-0:38:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:38:44):**  farmers to talk to the media.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:38:46):**  And it goes into specifics based on like what type of media outlet you're talking to a podcast,  
**[0:38:52-0:39:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:38:52):**  for example, versus a newspaper reporter versus video and how to crystallize your story and  
**[0:39:00-0:39:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:39:00):**  communicate it both effectively and authentically.  
**[0:39:03-0:39:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:39:03):**  And this is an area too that women can really shine in because we have these stories and  
**[0:39:08-0:39:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:39:08):**  we have this passionate connection to our farm and how can we help each other amplify  
**[0:39:15-0:39:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:39:15):**  that more?  
**[0:39:17-0:39:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:39:17):**  And that's what that is one specific toolkit on the media outreach front.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:39:22):**  We find that too, once women start sharing these stories more, anything from talking  
**[0:39:27-0:39:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:39:27):**  to a reporter to writing an op-ed for their local paper or other, that we become engaged  
**[0:39:32-0:39:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:39:32):**  more and we see the need for more leadership.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:39:35):**  And that's where, for example, here on my local level, well, one thing about women running  
**[0:39:41-0:39:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:39:41):**  for our office, and this is not specific to women in ag, it's just women in general, is  
**[0:39:45-0:39:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:39:45):**  we find that women need to be asked and specifically women need to be asked seven times on average  
**[0:39:51-0:39:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:39:51):**  to take on an elected official position, whereas men don't.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:39:57):**  And it's just, it is a gender difference that we need to well understand, but also help  
**[0:40:04-0:40:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:40:04):**  illustrate with women because a guy will be most likely to just say, well, you know, I'm  
**[0:40:07-0:40:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:40:07):**  going to run for County board done.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:40:09):**  As a woman needs to be asked and that women win as much proportionately as men statistically  
**[0:40:16-0:40:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:40:16):**  as men when it comes to these elected races, but we just don't run as much.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:40:21):**  And that's why you still see the significantly lower representation of women, be it from  
**[0:40:27-0:40:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:40:27):**  rural County boards to Congress.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:40:29):**  Right?  
**[0:40:30-0:40:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:40:30):**  So what happened to me locally, I think is a good microcosm of what's hopefully happening  
**[0:40:35-0:40:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:40:35):**  throughout the country where we as women are identifying leadership opportunities and encouraging  
**[0:40:40-0:40:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:40:40):**  each other to run.  
**[0:40:41-0:40:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:40:41):**  So this was a couple of years ago now, and we have a local group of women, our soil sisters  
**[0:40:47-0:40:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:40:47):**  group here that meets regularly now for close to 10 years for potlucks, but a lot of information  
**[0:40:52-0:40:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:40:52):**  and ideas and inspiration gets exchanged, you know, over good food and wine.  
**[0:40:55-0:40:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:40:55):**  Right?  
**[0:40:56-0:41:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:40:56):**  So we had our, it was right around the holidays and I was actually hosting at our farm and  
**[0:41:01-0:41:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:41:01):**  not surprisingly, sometimes three gates together, we lament over the lack of local leadership  
**[0:41:06-0:41:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:41:06):**  in our community.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:41:08):**  And we were doing that.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:41:09):**  And the next day, my local County extension agent Kara called me because she's part of  
**[0:41:15-0:41:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:41:15):**  our group here and said, Hey, you know, I heard there's an opening and this township  
**[0:41:20-0:41:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:41:20):**  in our County for County board, they're not running.  
**[0:41:22-0:41:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:41:22):**  Do we know anybody?  
**[0:41:23-0:41:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:41:23):**  We literally got out a map and the list of people who attended the last night and said,  
**[0:41:28-0:41:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:41:28):**  Hmm, who lives there and there was one woman, Betty Gerda, who lived in that township.  
**[0:41:33-0:41:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:41:33):**  And I had met her recently.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:41:35):**  It said, Hey, you know, I'm going to call her up and just see.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:41:38):**  And I remember that conversation.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:41:40):**  Well, because I was like, look, you're probably going to say no, you have every reason to  
**[0:41:42-0:41:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:41:42):**  say no.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:41:43):**  But we, I just wanted to say that we all think you'd be great to run for County board and  
**[0:41:48-0:41:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:41:48):**  we'll support you and be behind you and throw a party win or lose and would love to have  
**[0:41:53-0:41:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:41:53):**  you do this.  
**[0:41:54-0:41:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:41:54):**  And, you know, she didn't say no.  
**[0:41:55-0:41:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:41:55):**  She said, Hmm, I had been actually thinking about that.  
**[0:41:59-0:42:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:41:59):**  And it turns out her family, her, her dad had been on County board for years.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:42:03):**  She came from roots that were quite connected.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:42:06):**  And she was recently retired from the veterinarian school at the university and was at a place  
**[0:42:10-0:42:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:42:10):**  where she could do something like that.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:42:12):**  And she ended up running and winning.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:42:14):**  And since then, we've had now three women in our local women farming community who have  
**[0:42:19-0:42:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:42:19):**  successfully run for County board.  
**[0:42:21-0:42:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:42:21):**  And that's a game changer because we are bringing up issues of water quality and land management  
**[0:42:31-0:42:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:42:31):**  and sustainability and land stewardship that we're not at the table, or at least not as  
**[0:42:36-0:42:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:42:36):**  regular and definitely not as loud.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:42:39):**  So things start at that local level and they really start by encouraging each other.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:42:43):**  And even if somebody it's just not for a variety of reasons on their radar right now, when  
**[0:42:49-0:42:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:42:49):**  we see opportunities like that to pass them along because they plant seeds and maybe things  
**[0:42:53-0:42:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:42:53):**  happen a couple years down the line.  
**[0:42:55-0:42:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:42:55):**  But yeah, yeah.  
**[0:42:56-0:43:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:42:56):**  So that's a really something that we can all do of encouraging other people in our community  
**[0:43:02-0:43:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:43:02):**  and particularly that women women connection to run for office.  
**[0:43:06-0:43:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:43:06):**  The other thing too, as an aside, sorry, go ahead.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:43:11):**  I just want to say is sometimes sometimes when the democracy doesn't work, we need to  
**[0:43:15-0:43:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:43:15):**  take things into other hands.  
**[0:43:17-0:43:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:43:17):**  And that happened in a different topic, but related of we here in the United States have  
**[0:43:24-0:43:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:43:24):**  what are typically called cottage food laws.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:43:27):**  There's state specific laws that are increasing in numbers.  
**[0:43:31-0:43:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:43:31):**  We write about in our homemade for sale book, but in a nutshell, allow you to use your home  
**[0:43:35-0:43:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:43:35):**  kitchen for producing non-hazardous food for public sale.  
**[0:43:40-0:43:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:43:40):**  And this is a huge game changer, especially for farms and homesteads, because now we can  
**[0:43:44-0:43:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:43:44):**  legally sell things like our high acid canned items like pickles and jams.  
**[0:43:49-0:43:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:43:49):**  And in most states, fake goods, breads, muffins, that sort of thing.  
**[0:43:54-0:43:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:43:54):**  In my state of Wisconsin, we had a law that allowed the high acid canned items, but not  
**[0:43:59-0:44:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:43:59):**  baked goods, which was odd in that I ran this bed and breakfast.  
**[0:44:04-0:44:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:44:04):**  I don't need a commercial kitchen for a bed and breakfast.  
**[0:44:06-0:44:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:44:06):**  I could serve you Oliver, when you come visit my pumpkin chocolate chip muffins, but I couldn't  
**[0:44:11-0:44:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:44:11):**  sell you the same muffins.  
**[0:44:12-0:44:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:44:12):**  It didn't make sense.  
**[0:44:14-0:44:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:44:14):**  So we worked for years to try to get the cookie bill passed as legislation to allow the sale  
**[0:44:20-0:44:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:44:20):**  of home baked goods in our state and hit political barriers and people with power and money and  
**[0:44:27-0:44:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:44:27):**  influence who basically said, oh no, no, we can't do that.  
**[0:44:31-0:44:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:44:31):**  And rather than say, okay, or wait until new leadership came into power, we went down a  
**[0:44:37-0:44:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:44:37):**  couple doors as we know here, we have not just one branch of government legislative  
**[0:44:41-0:44:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:44:41):**  and executive, but judicial.  
**[0:44:43-0:44:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:44:43):**  And myself and two other female farmer friends, Chris Marion and Dela Enns successfully sued  
**[0:44:49-0:44:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:44:49):**  the state of Wisconsin to have the ban on the sale of home baked goods lifted.  
**[0:44:55-0:45:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:44:55):**  So now we have that in our state of both farms, but anybody who can sell their non-hazardous  
**[0:45:00-0:45:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:45:00):**  baked goods.  
**[0:45:01-0:45:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:45:01):**  So in those cases, leadership can often come from when we encounter these hurdles or in  
**[0:45:08-0:45:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:45:08):**  our case, a solid brick wall of influence that you can topple.  
**[0:45:16-0:45:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:45:16):**  And going back to what we were talking about earlier, Oliver, if we as farmers encounter  
**[0:45:21-0:45:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:45:21):**  barriers, I would put money on it.  
**[0:45:26-0:45:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:45:26):**  Not the only ones who are suffering from that.  
**[0:45:29-0:45:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:45:29):**  And the fact that I couldn't sell my muffins and my friends couldn't sell their bread,  
**[0:45:33-0:45:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:45:33):**  there were people throughout the state who were hitting that same thing.  
**[0:45:36-0:45:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:45:36):**  So it's that coming together that can really instigate some change and is definite opportunities  
**[0:45:43-0:45:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:45:43):**  for us on the leadership front.  
**[0:45:45-0:45:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:45:45):**  It doesn't always have to be elected office.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:45:46):**  There are lots of ways to start shifting things.  
**[0:45:51-0:45:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:45:51):**  I'm so glad you brought up all of those stories.  
**[0:45:53-0:45:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:45:53):**  And those are some really inspiring examples of how people can make real change in their  
**[0:45:57-0:46:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:45:57):**  communities through tenacity and through working with their local communities to gain support  
**[0:46:04-0:46:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:46:04):**  and figure out really what's needed in those areas and what people want.  
**[0:46:08-0:46:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:46:08):**  And I think this is coming at a very important moment because we find ourselves in an election  
**[0:46:14-0:46:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:46:14):**  year.  
**[0:46:15-0:46:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:46:15):**  And like you mentioned earlier, the census started counting women farmers only back in  
**[0:46:19-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:46:19):**  1978.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:46:21):**  And there's a real importance for getting proper representation through the census.  
**[0:46:25-0:46:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:46:25):**  And this translates into getting proper funding for things that count people that have otherwise  
**[0:46:32-0:46:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:46:32):**  been invisible to these types of metrics.  
**[0:46:34-0:46:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:46:34):**  Do you have a message that you'd like to give for the importance of participating in these  
**[0:46:38-0:46:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:46:38):**  processes and what can happen when better representation is gained?  
**[0:46:43-0:46:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:46:43):**  Sure, because part of the struggle is for us small scale farmers, homesteaders, we don't  
**[0:46:52-0:46:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:46:52):**  fit into the box like ever, right?  
**[0:46:55-0:46:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:46:55):**  And that can be frustrating and challenging.  
**[0:46:59-0:47:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:46:59):**  So even the ag census, for example, is not written for us.  
**[0:47:03-0:47:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:47:03):**  It's written for the majority to be represented does take effort.  
**[0:47:08-0:47:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:47:08):**  And that's the message we want to share in that we need to figure out how to navigate  
**[0:47:15-0:47:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:47:15):**  those things.  
**[0:47:16-0:47:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:47:16):**  And when we when we feel like the square pegs in the round holes, we need to both voice  
**[0:47:21-0:47:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:47:21):**  that, but also keep trying to navigate the system.  
**[0:47:24-0:47:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:47:24):**  And that's how things change.  
**[0:47:25-0:47:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:47:25):**  And I live in a very conventional agriculture dairy area.  
**[0:47:30-0:47:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:47:30):**  I mean, yes, we have some growing numbers of organic farms, and we have a vibrant network  
**[0:47:35-0:47:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:47:35):**  of women farmers, but we're still small proportionately.  
**[0:47:39-0:47:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:47:39):**  And we definitely are underrepresented when it comes to how our USDA office handles us,  
**[0:47:47-0:47:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:47:47):**  right?  
**[0:47:48-0:47:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:47:48):**  Or if we walk in the door of what programs are available, and we found, for example,  
**[0:47:51-0:47:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:47:51):**  that sometimes we as small scale farmers need to educate ourselves about the programs before  
**[0:47:57-0:48:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:47:57):**  we even walk into these doors, because there's so much there's so many in the USDA is so  
**[0:48:00-0:48:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:48:00):**  massive, right?  
**[0:48:03-0:48:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:48:03):**  That even when new opportunities come up, or there's some new conservation programs,  
**[0:48:09-0:48:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:48:09):**  that we need to keep on the forefront of those.  
**[0:48:13-0:48:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:48:13):**  So it's it's a good thing to is to have our voices represented on that policy note, which  
**[0:48:23-0:48:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:48:23):**  is often on the federal level, both the farm bill like you mentioned, but the farm bill  
**[0:48:29-0:48:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:48:29):**  is being renegotiated and appropriated every year, there's things we need to fight for  
**[0:48:32-0:48:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:48:32):**  funding.  
**[0:48:34-0:48:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:48:34):**  In the States, the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition or NSAC is a fabulous group based  
**[0:48:40-0:48:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:48:40):**  in DC that represents groups like Moses and others throughout the country on Capitol Hill  
**[0:48:46-0:48:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:48:46):**  when it comes to these issues.  
**[0:48:48-0:48:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:48:48):**  And they're a great group to connect with sign up for their e news because they keep  
**[0:48:52-0:48:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:48:52):**  their finger on the policy front.  
**[0:48:54-0:49:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:48:54):**  And wailing up for funding if the BFRDP that beginning farmer and development program,  
**[0:49:02-0:49:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:49:02):**  which really only recently came to full funding for beginning farmers, you think we would  
**[0:49:09-0:49:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:49:09):**  have had that already, but we don't and we have to fight for that all the time.  
**[0:49:12-0:49:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:49:12):**  But when those sort of things come up in the committees in Congress, that they will keep  
**[0:49:18-0:49:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:49:18):**  you posted.  
**[0:49:20-0:49:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:49:20):**  And if you're who to call, whether it's your senator or somebody else to voice those, I'm  
**[0:49:25-0:49:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:49:25):**  always amazed by over with those calls, you think like, one call doesn't matter.  
**[0:49:30-0:49:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:49:30):**  You think they need hundreds, thousands of calls, and it's it's like 10.  
**[0:49:35-0:49:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:49:35):**  If your elected official gets 10 calls on an issue that we need more funding for the  
**[0:49:40-0:49:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:49:40):**  value added producer grant, they will notice so it doesn't and especially calls coming  
**[0:49:45-0:49:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:49:45):**  from farmers.  
**[0:49:47-0:49:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:49:47):**  And these programs we're talking about, it's super important to share your story when you  
**[0:49:52-0:49:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:49:52):**  have benefited from something.  
**[0:49:54-0:49:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:49:54):**  So with that amplifier voices toolkit, for example, of helping women share their stories  
**[0:49:59-0:50:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:49:59):**  with the media.  
**[0:50:00-0:50:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:50:00):**  Yeah, you know, if there's NRCS programs that you've been involved with that have helped  
**[0:50:05-0:50:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:50:05):**  bring conservation per land share those or say or the sustainable agriculture research  
**[0:50:11-0:50:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:50:11):**  education has a lot of programs and funding for farms in the sustainable agriculture community  
**[0:50:18-0:50:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:50:18):**  share those stories because that's what's going to get the more on the forefront but  
**[0:50:23-0:50:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:50:23):**  we need to we need to keep our pulse on those bigger funding pictures because it's it's  
**[0:50:29-0:50:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:50:29):**  a constant fight and it's just a battle and that's the way it is but it rolls slowly.  
**[0:50:36-0:50:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:50:36):**  Do happen slowly but individual voices make a huge difference.  
**[0:50:41-0:50:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:50:41):**  That's so good to hear and it gives a lot of hope that in these times of transitions  
**[0:50:46-0:50:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:50:46):**  by being persistent and really taking the opportunity to have your voice heard that  
**[0:50:51-0:50:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:50:51):**  things can start to change for the positive even if they look bleak at the moment.  
**[0:50:55-0:51:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:50:55):**  And before we wrap up here because this series is focused on regenerative agriculture, you  
**[0:51:01-0:51:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:51:01):**  know, perhaps you might call it sustainable agriculture ecological goes by a lot of names,  
**[0:51:05-0:51:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:51:05):**  but it seems like women have a particular role in bringing the health of the ecology  
**[0:51:11-0:51:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:51:11):**  back into the farms and that they have a much greater tendency to be connected to the holistic  
**[0:51:17-0:51:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:51:17):**  health of their land.  
**[0:51:19-0:51:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:51:19):**  Can you talk about that from your experience?  
**[0:51:21-0:51:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:51:21):**  Sure, and it's it's most definitely not to say that men don't but it it's celebrating  
**[0:51:27-0:51:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:51:27):**  the differences in gender and diversity in people and what are some of our strengths  
**[0:51:35-0:51:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:51:35):**  and how can those strengths help all of us move forward and yeah, I think there's a reason  
**[0:51:42-0:51:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:51:42):**  we called her mother nature to start it is there is a natural tendency of women to mother  
**[0:51:50-0:51:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:51:50):**  to care to nurture and to see any mom with kids.  
**[0:51:55-0:51:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:51:55):**  It's the same sort of thing.  
**[0:51:56-0:52:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:51:56):**  It's a multifaceted process.  
**[0:52:00-0:52:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:52:00):**  And it's also seeing things 10 steps ahead.  
**[0:52:04-0:52:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:52:04):**  It's not the immediate of I need to get as much yield from this field as I can.  
**[0:52:11-0:52:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:52:11):**  It's where things going to be next year, where's my kid going to be in five years.  
**[0:52:15-0:52:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:52:15):**  And so that really helps and one thing specific example that I find fascinating is I see a  
**[0:52:21-0:52:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:52:21):**  lot of interest and absorption of women farmers when it comes to things like cover crops,  
**[0:52:27-0:52:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:52:27):**  you know, which are I would say increasing in popularity.  
**[0:52:32-0:52:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:52:32):**  They've they've hope they've been around all the time, but at least in more traditional  
**[0:52:36-0:52:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:52:36):**  agriculture spheres have not and this idea of literally nurturing your soil and literally  
**[0:52:44-0:52:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:52:44):**  attempting to benefit it for the long term.  
**[0:52:47-0:52:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:52:47):**  It comes super naturally to women farmers.  
**[0:52:50-0:52:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:52:50):**  And that's something that as an example is a tangible to use as an educational tool.  
**[0:52:58-0:53:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:52:58):**  I mean, especially in a place like I am where you're probably surrounded by conventional  
**[0:53:04-0:53:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:53:04):**  male farmers and you are growing these cover crops, you know, and your yield is high and  
**[0:53:10-0:53:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:53:10):**  your soil is healthy.  
**[0:53:12-0:53:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:53:12):**  And gosh, golly, you know, they can even be cheaper than chemical and pesticide additives  
**[0:53:16-0:53:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:53:16):**  and that can engage in conversation with other farmers outside of our organic world that  
**[0:53:23-0:53:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:53:23):**  can be super powerful.  
**[0:53:26-0:53:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:53:26):**  So it's both the doing but it's also the sharing and and it's interesting too, because conservation  
**[0:53:33-0:53:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:53:33):**  can have some bottom lines financially that can help drive those conversations to people  
**[0:53:40-0:53:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:53:40):**  who may not be immediately sold to the sustainability side, but cash talks and that can help too.  
**[0:53:48-0:53:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:53:48):**  Sure, sure.  
**[0:53:50-0:53:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:53:50):**  Undoubtedly.  
**[0:53:51-0:53:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:53:51):**  Well, along those lines, can you tell our listeners where they can find out more information?  
**[0:53:56-0:54:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:53:56):**  I know we just started to scratch the surface of all of the fantastic resources that are  
**[0:54:01-0:54:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:54:01):**  out there for new farmers and women farmers, especially in the United States.  
**[0:54:05-0:54:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:54:05):**  And you have a huge body of work yourself.  
**[0:54:08-0:54:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:54:08):**  I have been kind of starting to work through your literature from the Farmstead Chef, Rural  
**[0:54:14-0:54:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:54:14):**  Renaissance and Ecopreneuring Homemade for Sale.  
**[0:54:19-0:54:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:54:19):**  You've got some fantastic resources out there.  
**[0:54:21-0:54:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:54:21):**  Can you point our listeners in the direction to find out more?  
**[0:54:26-0:54:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:54:26):**  You bet you.  
**[0:54:28-0:54:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:54:28):**  So she mentioned that John and I wrote and then the Soil Sisters book are probably best  
**[0:54:35-0:54:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:54:35):**  at our main farm web page in Serendipity, INNSerendipity.com and you can find a host  
**[0:54:46-0:54:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:54:46):**  of links out there.  
**[0:54:47-0:54:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:54:47):**  I'd mentioned a couple nonprofit doing the countryside has a growing women and egg program  
**[0:54:55-0:55:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:54:55):**  that has the amplifier toolkit and this Soil Sisters project I mentioned locally here that  
**[0:55:02-0:55:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:55:02):**  I birthed, we are angling to get some Soil Sisters chapters and other things happening  
**[0:55:08-0:55:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:55:08):**  throughout the Midwest and pilot this year and hopefully further on.  
**[0:55:12-0:55:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:55:12):**  So that is a good resource.  
**[0:55:15-0:55:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:55:15):**  And then I have had the honor of working with Moses, the Midwest Organic Sustainable Education  
**[0:55:19-0:55:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:55:19):**  Service now for over 10 years on our In Her Boots project.  
**[0:55:23-0:55:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:55:23):**  That's our women farmer training.  
**[0:55:25-0:55:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:55:25):**  So Mosesorganic.org, you'll see a variety of organic resources.  
**[0:55:30-0:55:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:55:30):**  And then the In Her Boots project where we host various field days, we have this In Her  
**[0:55:35-0:55:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:55:35):**  Boots podcast and do land conservation training for women as well.  
**[0:55:40-0:55:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:55:40):**  So those are a couple that I've been directly involved with.  
**[0:55:43-0:55:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:55:43):**  But yeah, it's a good time to jump into this as a woman because there's just a number of  
**[0:55:49-0:55:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:55:49):**  growing resources.  
**[0:55:51-0:55:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:55:51):**  And again, that collaborative support, be it figurative online, but also literal with  
**[0:55:57-0:56:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:55:57):**  you'd be amazed at who might be in your own neighborhood already to connect with.  
**[0:56:02-0:56:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:56:02):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:56:03-0:56:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:56:03):**  And before we go, I want to commend you for all the incredible work that you've done in  
**[0:56:08-0:56:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:56:08):**  advancing these issues.  
**[0:56:09-0:56:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:56:09):**  And I'm so glad that you've made it available to sell home baked goods in Wisconsin.  
**[0:56:15-0:56:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:56:15):**  Again, what a fantastic gift to that state that came out of that struggle.  
**[0:56:20-0:56:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:56:20):**  And come for cookies.  
**[0:56:22-0:56:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:56:22):**  I can't wait.  
**[0:56:23-0:56:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:56:23):**  You know, I'll tell you what, the next time I go back and visit my brothers in the Twin  
**[0:56:26-0:56:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:56:26):**  Cities, I'll see if I can't make a trip out to your area and see the farmstead.  
**[0:56:31-0:56:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:56:31):**  And we also have, you know, cheese and beer for you in Wisconsin.  
**[0:56:36-0:56:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:56:36):**  We'll take care of you.  
**[0:56:37-0:56:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:56:37):**  I mean, you can't forget that stuff.  
**[0:56:38-0:56:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:56:38):**  That's what I remember from that area.  
**[0:56:42-0:56:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:56:42):**  Well thank you so much for being so generous with your time, Lisa.  
**[0:56:45-0:56:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:56:45):**  I really hope we can catch up again sometime soon.  
**[0:56:48-0:56:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:56:48):**  There's so much more that we can explore from all the rest of your experience and from your  
**[0:56:51-0:56:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:56:51):**  writings.  
**[0:56:52-0:56:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:56:52):**  So until then, thanks for making time and we'll talk again soon.  
**[0:56:56-0:56:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/lisa-kivirist/#t=0:56:56):**  You bet.

**[0:01:30-0:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:01:30):**  Welcome to our last interview in this month's focus on regenerative communities.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:01:34):**  Today I had the pleasure of speaking with Alan Ohashi.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:01:37):**  Alan is a newspaper journalist turned documentary filmmaker and screenwriter who works with  
**[0:01:41-0:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:01:41):**  groups and organizations to help them tell their stories and is also organizing an intentional  
**[0:01:46-0:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:01:46):**  creative community in Cheyenne, Wyoming.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:01:48):**  For the focus of this interview, Alan speaks from his experience as a board member of the  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:01:52):**  U.S. Cohousing Association and his time living in Silver Sage Village, a cohousing retirement  
**[0:01:57-0:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:01:57):**  community in Boulder, Colorado.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:02:00):**  In this interview, Alan defines cohousing communities and their myriad configurations  
**[0:02:03-0:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:02:03):**  across the country.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:02:05):**  We explore the benefits that cohousing can bring to your lifestyle regardless of how  
**[0:02:08-0:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:02:08):**  you live, as well as the challenges that it could present for people more accustomed to  
**[0:02:12-0:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:02:12):**  living alone or are used to being independent and disconnected from their communities.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:02:16):**  We also discuss where the cohousing movement is headed and how it's growing quickly as  
**[0:02:20-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:02:20):**  people, especially in the United States, aspire to become more connected and reliant on their  
**[0:02:24-0:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:02:24):**  local areas.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:02:26):**  If you're living in a cohousing community, are considering moving to one, or have left  
**[0:02:30-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:02:30):**  one because of the challenges involved, I would love to hear from you in the comments  
**[0:02:33-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:02:33):**  or directly through info at abundantedge.com.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:02:36):**  Now that I'm actively searching for a new home and community to invest in, cohousing  
**[0:02:40-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:02:40):**  is something that I'm looking into closely and would love to hear about your personal  
**[0:02:43-0:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:02:43):**  experience.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:02:44):**  So, from here, I'll turn things over now to Alan.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:02:47):**  Hey Alan, thanks so much for taking the time to be with us today.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:02:50):**  How are you doing?  
**[0:02:51-0:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:02:51):**  Oliver, I'm sure you're having a great day down there in Guatemala.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:02:54):**  Yeah, it is really beautiful this time of year.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:02:57):**  But you said that you're having some unseasonable weather in winter in Boulder, Colorado as  
**[0:03:01-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:03:01):**  well?  
**[0:03:02-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:03:02):**  Well, I don't know if it's unseasonable, but it's part of our usual erratic weather in  
**[0:03:08-0:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:03:08):**  February in Colorado.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:03:09):**  It's really blue sky, 50s, the snow's melted, and I'm walking around in t-shirts.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:03:16):**  That sounds pretty nice too.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:03:17):**  Well, hey, look, I've got a ton of questions to ask you about cohousing and the community  
**[0:03:22-0:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:03:22):**  structures around it.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:03:24):**  So what do you say we just jump into the questions?  
**[0:03:25-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:03:25):**  Let's have at it.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:03:27):**  All right, so let's start from the beginning.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:03:29):**  Could you tell me a little bit about your own journey in cohousing and how you came  
**[0:03:33-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:03:33):**  to be a board member of the U.S. Cohousing Association?  
**[0:03:36-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:03:36):**  Well, I'll tell you.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:03:39):**  When I first became aware of cohousing, I really was at sea.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:03:44):**  I didn't really know much about it, except intellectually.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:03:48):**  I happened to be on the City of Boulder planning board at the time that Silver Sage Village,  
**[0:03:53-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:03:53):**  where I happen to live, came up as one of the projects for approval here in the North  
**[0:04:00-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:04:00):**  Boulder, Colorado.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:04:02):**  And I happened to also live 600 feet away from the site.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:04:09):**  And as a result, I wasn't able to participate in the deliberations because I was an affected  
**[0:04:14-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:04:14):**  resident and couldn't participate.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:04:17):**  So I had to declare conflict of interest and lo and behold, the project was approved by  
**[0:04:22-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:04:22):**  the board and several years later, it popped up in the neighborhood.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:04:27):**  I was just living, like I said, 600 feet away in another part of the development.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:04:33):**  So time passes and our place was a two-story townhouse, stairs and all that stuff.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:04:41):**  And the dogs were having a hard time getting up and down the stairs.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:04:44):**  I was having a hard time getting up and down the stairs.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:04:47):**  Diana was having a hard time getting up and down the stairs.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:04:50):**  And she had paid more closer attention to the cohousing idea.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:04:54):**  She had gone to a couple planning meetings and that sort of stuff.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:04:57):**  But they're always five or six years out from fruition.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:05:02):**  And so we moved into this place where we were at.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:05:06):**  But meanwhile, Silver Sage is going strong and we got tired of walking up and down the  
**[0:05:14-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:05:14):**  stairs and she decided we needed a place that was on the ground floor, no stairs, no stoops,  
**[0:05:23-0:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:05:23):**  handicap accessible.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:05:25):**  And a guy died over here at Silver Sage and we bought his place.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:05:28):**  We met all those criteria.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:05:31):**  So I kind of came blindly into cohousing.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:05:34):**  I didn't really know a lot about it other than intellectually.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:05:38):**  But how I became a disciple is I had my road to Tarsus moment when I was stricken with  
**[0:05:45-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:05:45):**  a death-defying illness back in December 2013.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:05:49):**  I was written off for dead after being in the hospital for six weeks and rehab for a  
**[0:05:56-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:05:56):**  couple of weeks.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:05:57):**  And lo and behold, the University of Michigan found out what was wrong with me.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:06:02):**  I relocated and here we are talking about housing.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:06:06):**  But meanwhile, I was flat on my back.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:06:09):**  I was in a wheelchair, supplemental.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:06:12):**  I had a visit from the ghost of Christmases yet to come and I didn't like what I saw.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:06:19):**  And I was happy and relieved to know that I had made it back.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:06:24):**  And what was the great part about it is all the neighbors came by, they brought food,  
**[0:06:30-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:06:30):**  they chipped in money to help defray some of the transport between the hospital and  
**[0:06:35-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:06:35):**  this place.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:06:37):**  And so that's really what cohousing is.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:06:39):**  It's not, it's building.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:06:43):**  But at the same time, there's a secret sauce of cohousing that really differentiates this  
**[0:06:48-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:06:48):**  housing configuration from all the other housing configurations.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:06:52):**  So that's my cohousing story and I'm sticking to it.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:06:56):**  And as a result, I've been spreading the word as much as I can, any opportunity and to anybody  
**[0:07:03-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:07:03):**  in any group who's willing to listen to me, I'm the enthusiastic disciple.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:07:09):**  That's an incredible story, especially overcoming that illness and seeing how much your community  
**[0:07:13-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:07:13):**  came through for you when you really needed them.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:07:16):**  Is that one of the bigger benefits that you've found since moving into a cohousing situation?  
**[0:07:22-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:07:22):**  I would say so.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:07:24):**  Really cohousing, there's the secret sauce really has like four components to it.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:07:31):**  One component is the relationship part.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:07:33):**  And that's the part that you really don't understand unless you really kind of experience  
**[0:07:38-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:07:38):**  it.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:07:39):**  And so what happens is neighbors get together, a group of friends, a group of acquaintances  
**[0:07:44-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:07:44):**  get together and decide that they want to be part of a community for kind of their mutual  
**[0:07:48-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:07:48):**  benefit.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:07:49):**  And so the whole idea is you create this cohousing culture that's based on sharing and caring.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:07:57):**  And our place, we're kind of small, we're 16 units, but there's a wild sage cohousing  
**[0:08:01-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:08:01):**  that's across the street and they have, I think 32 units.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:08:05):**  And so the idea is to have a group of neighbors who have their own homes and that sort of  
**[0:08:15-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:08:15):**  segues into the sort of the next characteristic.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:08:17):**  It has to do with balancing privacy and community.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:08:20):**  So we all own our own houses and we all have our own residences.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:08:25):**  And so we can kind of pick and choose the level of community that we want to have.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:08:30):**  So like for instance, when I just got back from the hospital, I kind of really backed  
**[0:08:34-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:08:34):**  off.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:08:35):**  I decided I needed more privacy and just basically take care of my personal wellbeing.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:08:40):**  And so now I'm starting to get back just recently really into participating in the communities.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:08:48):**  So there's that balance between privacy and community.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:08:52):**  And then the other part is everyone sort of chips in their time.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:08:58):**  And the idea is that we all share in the upkeep and maintenance of the area.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:09:06):**  We shovel the sidewalks.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:09:08):**  We help pick weeds in the garden in the summertime.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:09:12):**  And we decide on how we're going to do that.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:09:17):**  And that's through a budget.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:09:18):**  You know, we're basically set up as a homeowners association in HOA.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:09:22):**  And so we pass through the expenses and all that.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:09:25):**  And we have dues based on all that.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:09:27):**  So then we participate through the self-management of the organization.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:09:32):**  And probably the most important thing that's sort of the umbrella overall, this is the  
**[0:09:37-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:09:37):**  share of values.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:09:39):**  We have a mission statement and we have values and how we're going to work together to make  
**[0:09:46-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:09:46):**  the world a better place and all that sort of stuff.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:09:48):**  So those are the four characteristics of the co-housing secret sauce.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:09:52):**  And I'm glad, basically what it is is everybody has bought into those.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:09:57):**  And so when someone gets sick, it's not this thing about, well, give me a call if you need  
**[0:10:03-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:10:03):**  something.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:10:04):**  But co-housing, what it is is you need some help.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:10:07):**  What can I do for you right now?  
**[0:10:09-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:10:09):**  And so you need a jump.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:10:11):**  I have cables.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:10:13):**  You're in the hospital.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:10:14):**  I'll stop by and see you when I'm out and about.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:10:16):**  So it's this notion of intentionality that sort of separates the co-housing secret sauce.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:10:21):**  Those of us who've put that on our hot dogs and sort of regular housing, traditional housing  
**[0:10:28-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:10:28):**  configurations.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:10:29):**  Now, you didn't grow up in a co-housing unit yourself.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:10:34):**  What have been the most significant changes in lifestyle for you since you started living  
**[0:10:38-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:10:38):**  closer with your community?  
**[0:10:40-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:10:40):**  Well, you know, for myself, this was just another iteration of living in close quarters.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:10:50):**  Because when I was a kid, you know, I'm Japanese and so we have sort of this family thing going.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:10:56):**  And so, you know, my grandfather had moved in with us when I was young because he was  
**[0:11:01-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:11:01):**  grand.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:11:02):**  My grandmother, his wife couldn't take care of him for a period of time when he had diabetes.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:11:07):**  And so there was that early, early instance.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:11:11):**  I lived in the college dorms for four years.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:11:14):**  Not only did I live in the dorms, I lived in the same dorm room for four years.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:11:18):**  And then when I got out into the real world, my first housing experience when I had a job  
**[0:11:24-0:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:11:24):**  was looking at a house with four guys.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:11:27):**  I bought a house with two other guys.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:11:30):**  And after that, I moved to, that was in Gillette, Wyoming.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:11:33):**  And then I moved to Lander, Wyoming.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:11:35):**  And first place I lived was in an apartment above the Ace Hardware store.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:11:39):**  The drugstore was downstairs, the movie was across the street.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:11:42):**  My job was a half a block away.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:11:45):**  And after that, I just really bought into this mixed use urban living thing before it  
**[0:11:50-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:11:50):**  became fashionable.  
**[0:11:52-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:11:52):**  And so I've always kind of been living in this sort of environment and people on top  
**[0:12:01-0:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:12:01):**  of me and next door to me and in my business.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:12:04):**  And so moving into co-housing for me was an easy transition.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:12:11):**  But there are some people who move into co-housing.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:12:12):**  They lived in the cul-de-sac on acreage and they're used to making decisions on what color  
**[0:12:18-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:12:18):**  they're going to paint their house or if they're going to chop down this tree or if they're  
**[0:12:21-0:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:12:21):**  going to bother to mow the yard this week or not.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:12:27):**  And so it's this whole idea of having to shed those issues of control and seed them to this  
**[0:12:36-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:12:36):**  notion of cooperation.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:12:38):**  And at one time you could chop down the tree if you wanted.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:12:42):**  Now you got to ask 20 people if you can chop down a tree.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:12:45):**  When I paint your house purple, you could do that.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:12:48):**  Now you have to ask 20 people if you can paint your house purple.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:12:51):**  So I would say that for me there really wasn't much of a transition in terms of living in  
**[0:12:57-0:12:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:12:57):**  co-housing.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:12:59):**  But even to digress farther, I'm a baby boomer and so we lived in a neighborhood that everybody  
**[0:13:09-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:13:09):**  knew each other.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:13:10):**  The parents knew each other because kids came running through everyone's houses.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:13:13):**  We had neighborhood schools.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:13:15):**  All the garage doors were open.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:13:17):**  And so co-housing really tries to reinvent old style neighborhoods but one community  
**[0:13:24-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:13:24):**  at a time.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:13:25):**  And so I think that's the sort of long vision of what co-housing is trying to do.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:13:32):**  Sort of this alternative to bowling alone or loneliness.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:13:38):**  Now there's a lot of different types of configurations for co-housing.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:13:42):**  You yourself are living in a co-housing community that was intended for retirees.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:13:48):**  But can you explain some of the other configurations that you've seen within the network and the  
**[0:13:54-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:13:54):**  differences in the way that they're structured?  
**[0:13:58-0:14:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:13:58):**  Right.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:14:01):**  We live in Silver Sage Village and everyone here is over 50.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:14:05):**  And there's also a multi-generational co-housing which is multi-generational.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:14:10):**  People of all ages.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:14:11):**  And so there are communities that form around interests for instance.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:14:21):**  I guess being a senior citizen would be an interest.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:14:24):**  But I live in Colorado and we have beer and breweries and microbreweries around here.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:14:30):**  And so I've sort of categorized co-housing types.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:14:34):**  I think there's like three types of them.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:14:36):**  Over the years I think they've sort of differentiated themselves into three groups.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:14:41):**  And one would be like co-housing stout and that would be like Silver Sage Village where  
**[0:14:47-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:14:47):**  you have a few burning souls, a few really big strong advocates and they partner up with  
**[0:14:53-0:15:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:14:53):**  an architect or some sort of real estate professional and go through the brain damage of doing a  
**[0:15:00-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:15:00):**  development.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:15:01):**  And it's very time consuming.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:15:03):**  It takes sometimes five to seven years.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:15:06):**  Some people are still working on them after lengthy periods of time.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:15:11):**  And it's very capital intensive because you have to buy the land, you have to hire the  
**[0:15:16-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:15:16):**  professionals, you have to go through the permitting.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:15:19):**  And then there's the construction cost for your housing.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:15:22):**  And so basically the people who are bought into the community in partnership with the  
**[0:15:28-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:15:28):**  design professional and developer, they have to bear all the costs of co-housing for co-housing  
**[0:15:36-0:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:15:36):**  stout and that would be traditional.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:15:39):**  And there's only like 166 of those, maybe 200 in all of North America.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:15:44):**  So it's not like it's the fashion, the housing type of the day.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:15:50):**  And then there's another type that's sort of in between those two.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:15:53):**  I call it co-housing light.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:15:56):**  And what that is is you would have a developer.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:16:00):**  I'll use the example of a community in Bloomington, Indiana.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:16:05):**  Bloomington Co-Housing is driven by the developer and Lauren Woods and his business is building  
**[0:16:13-0:16:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:16:13):**  houses and selling them.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:16:14):**  And so he has bought a piece of land, an acre, and has now hired an architect and building  
**[0:16:22-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:16:22):**  a co-housing community.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:16:25):**  And so he's really engaged in co-housing and really wants to get the co-housing thing to  
**[0:16:29-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:16:29):**  go.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:16:30):**  On the side, he's been forming a community of people from Bloomington or other places  
**[0:16:37-0:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:16:37):**  who want to live in this community.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:16:39):**  And so what happens there is it's architect driven, it's developer driven, and the Burning  
**[0:16:44-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:16:44):**  Souls are still active and recruiting members to the community.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:16:50):**  But at the same time, the development is less time consuming because that's all being taken  
**[0:16:54-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:16:54):**  care of by other professionals.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:16:56):**  Less capital intensive, of course, because all you would be responsible for is buying  
**[0:17:01-0:17:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:17:01):**  your house.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:17:02):**  And that would include not only the cost of your house but the cost of the rest of the  
**[0:17:07-0:17:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:17:07):**  development.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:17:08):**  So that's co-housing light.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:17:11):**  There's another one and it seems like in Canada there's more places like in Vancouver that  
**[0:17:16-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:17:16):**  are using this configuration.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:17:19):**  And the one I've been really advocating because obviously you can't build them fast enough  
**[0:17:24-0:17:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:17:24):**  and they're really expensive to do.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:17:27):**  And so for it to really hit a tipping point, I think co-housing ultralight is the one configuration  
**[0:17:34-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:17:34):**  that basically takes the secret sauce and kind of pours it over other types of housing  
**[0:17:38-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:17:38):**  configurations.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:17:39):**  And there's a pretty good example in Genesee, it's called Genesee Gardens, it's in Lansing,  
**[0:17:45-0:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:17:45):**  Michigan.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:17:46):**  And what they did was they bought a group of houses within a neighbor, existing urban  
**[0:17:49-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:17:49):**  neighborhood and renovated them.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:17:52):**  They donated some of their front yards to be common space for the whole community.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:17:57):**  Bought another house that they're redoing to make into a common house.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:18:03):**  And so they can add and subtract because people are coming and going, there are other houses  
**[0:18:09-0:18:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:18:09):**  in the neighborhood, they could invite other people in who would want to buy other houses.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:18:14):**  So that's an example of what would be co-housing ultralight.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:18:17):**  There's a group in Traverse City, Michigan also forming a community before they move  
**[0:18:24-0:18:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:18:24):**  into or they're working with a developer to convert a mental health facility, old mental  
**[0:18:30-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:18:30):**  health facility into condos.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:18:33):**  And so that's another aspect where another example of using this retrofit approach but  
**[0:18:41-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:18:41):**  spending more time developing the community.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:18:44):**  So those are the three general types of co-housing configurations that general categories.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:18:54):**  And what type of people does co-housing tend to attract?  
**[0:18:58-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:18:58):**  Is it a lot of families and people generally searching for more community or is it broader  
**[0:19:04-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:19:04):**  than that?  
**[0:19:05-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:19:05):**  Well, there's a couple of others to that.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:19:08):**  The typical co-housing that would live in a co-housing stout or a co-housing line, more  
**[0:19:13-0:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:19:13):**  of the traditional co-housing.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:19:15):**  The demographics are these.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:19:18):**  That tend to have a higher perceived social class, they have high incomes obviously because  
**[0:19:25-0:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:19:25):**  of having to bear the cost of development, high education levels, Caucasian and 60% of  
**[0:19:32-0:19:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:19:32):**  the time a woman.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:19:34):**  And so for whatever reason, women are attracted to a co-housing.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:19:44):**  Stereotype of co-housing, I guess that would be the stereotype of who would be a typical  
**[0:19:49-0:19:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:19:49):**  co-hauser.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:19:51):**  But on the other hand, like for co-housing ultralight where you're moving into other  
**[0:19:58-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:19:58):**  kinds of repurposed buildings and repurposed projects, those people also tend to be a little  
**[0:20:04-0:20:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:20:04):**  bit liberal or progressive.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:20:07):**  They're social class.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:20:08):**  There are more people who identify as being middle class, more people who earn moderate  
**[0:20:12-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:20:12):**  incomes although still having high education levels and more single people than single  
**[0:20:18-0:20:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:20:18):**  parents.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:20:21):**  The reason that co-housing ultralight communities are more diverse is because they tend to locate  
**[0:20:27-0:20:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:20:27):**  in lower cost areas and urban areas.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:20:31):**  So you have this continuum between co-housing, traditional co-housing and retrofit co-housing.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:20:39):**  And then there's a whole bunch of people in between.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:20:43):**  There are people who really closely identify with co-housing but then there are a lot of  
**[0:20:49-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:20:49):**  people who like co-housing but they're trying to figure out how they can get into a community  
**[0:20:54-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:20:54):**  that's more accessible to them.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:20:56):**  And so that's why co-housing ultralight should be appealing to most of the people who are  
**[0:21:04-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:21:04):**  interested in co-housing.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:21:07):**  What are some of the main things that you see people getting a lot of value out of when  
**[0:21:10-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:21:10):**  they make the switch to a co-housing lifestyle from one that perhaps was more separated or  
**[0:21:16-0:21:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:21:16):**  removed from their community?  
**[0:21:18-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:21:18):**  I would say that it's kind of what we were just talking about earlier.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:21:25):**  Co-housing, like for instance our co-housing association, you don't have like the cul-de-sac  
**[0:21:30-0:21:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:21:30):**  subdivision housing association where people who live in the suburbs get together and talk  
**[0:21:38-0:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:21:38):**  about how to build their houses or how to create a community within their neighborhood.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:21:46):**  You just don't see that.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:21:48):**  Co-housing is the only group that intentionally has conferences, intentionally has meetings  
**[0:21:56-0:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:21:56):**  and web chats talking about how we build community and what are some of the pitfalls of being  
**[0:22:05-0:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:22:05):**  in a community because basically what happens is that co-housing is sort of contrary to  
**[0:22:11-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:22:11):**  the American way.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:22:12):**  The American way is rugged individualism and I can take care of myself and I can do this  
**[0:22:19-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:22:19):**  on my own and I don't need anybody else and so trying to fit the square co-housing peg  
**[0:22:28-0:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:22:28):**  which is kind of just the opposite of that.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:22:30):**  We want to work together, we want to care for each other, we're reliant on others for  
**[0:22:34-0:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:22:34):**  our assistance and trying to pound that square peg into the American dream round hole and  
**[0:22:41-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:22:41):**  that creates conflict.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:22:42):**  So I think there are a lot of people who intellectually understand co-housing but as you know like  
**[0:22:47-0:22:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:22:47):**  in my personal example I didn't really get the essence or the gist of co-housing until  
**[0:22:54-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:22:54):**  I actually needed to participate in the community at a really high level.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:22:57):**  Does that answer partially your question?  
**[0:23:00-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:23:00):**  Yeah, no definitely.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:23:01):**  Now I know that a lot of co-housing arrangements kind of form around environmental values.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:23:08):**  What has been your experience with the priorities of these co-housing configurations and how  
**[0:23:14-0:23:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:23:14):**  they treat the local environment and ecology around them?  
**[0:23:17-0:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:23:17):**  Well you know I think it's a good model and so certainly everybody at Silver Sage has  
**[0:23:26-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:23:26):**  one car, we all recycle, we do the best we can to be friendly to our environment.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:23:37):**  We just spend a whole bunch of money and we put in solar panels on our building and so  
**[0:23:43-0:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:23:43):**  we generate electricity to operate our common building and earn a little bit of profit to  
**[0:23:51-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:23:51):**  put back in the bank.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:23:52):**  And so I'd say that I don't know if we do it any more than a lot of people.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:23:58):**  Of course in Boulder we kind of live in this weird little bubble here and so I go to other  
**[0:24:05-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:24:05):**  places and you don't recycle or there's a place to separate out the bottles and cans  
**[0:24:11-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:24:11):**  from the paper and so I'm surprised when I go to places and they don't actually do the  
**[0:24:19-0:24:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:24:19):**  basic run-of-the-mill recycling for example.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:24:25):**  And so I think that we're no different than anybody else really.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:24:31):**  In fact you might run into other communities that have more, some of the eco villages that  
**[0:24:36-0:24:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:24:36):**  raise their own food and maybe even raise food for the greater community.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:24:42):**  But I think we, you know on a micro level we do pretty well.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:24:47):**  We have some gardens here and of course you know we go outside and pick a sprig of lettuce  
**[0:24:56-0:25:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:24:56):**  instead of having to run to the store to get one but you know certainly you can't grow  
**[0:25:01-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:25:01):**  rice checks and you certainly can't you know grow, raise a chicken or certainly I suppose  
**[0:25:07-0:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:25:07):**  we could but you know you still have to go to the store and you still have to, you know  
**[0:25:12-0:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:25:12):**  we don't have a cow we can milk and get fresh dairy.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:25:14):**  Sure you're not fully self-sufficient but you're still making some conscious efforts  
**[0:25:18-0:25:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:25:18):**  towards environmentalism.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:25:19):**  Well I think we do but I think in Boulder for example you know that's just kind of part  
**[0:25:25-0:25:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:25:25):**  of the part of the thing.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:25:28):**  And if but I'd say that because of the ilk of people who end up in co-housing as I mentioned  
**[0:25:35-0:25:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:25:35):**  the demographic I'd say we you know probably do it a little bit more intentionally than  
**[0:25:42-0:25:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:25:42):**  a lot of places.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:25:44):**  Let's switch gears for a second here and talk about some of the challenges of living in  
**[0:25:48-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:25:48):**  such close proximity when a lot of especially Americans are not really used to that way  
**[0:25:54-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:25:54):**  of life.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:25:57):**  Have you had much experience with conflict coming up in your own in your own situation  
**[0:26:02-0:26:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:26:02):**  and what are some of the ways that the co-housing association helps established places get past  
**[0:26:10-0:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:26:10):**  the conflicts that could derail the cooperation?  
**[0:26:15-0:26:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:26:15):**  Well you know I would say that I would say all co-housing communities have those issues  
**[0:26:22-0:26:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:26:22):**  that you just raised but you know kind of the one of the mantras is the best thing about  
**[0:26:27-0:26:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:26:27):**  co-housing is the neighbors and the worst thing about co-housing is the neighbors.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:26:32):**  And so basically you get to know people on a level that you wouldn't normally get to  
**[0:26:37-0:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:26:37):**  know people.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:26:39):**  People who you know you don't get you know people who are just basically your neighbors.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:26:44):**  And so because we operate on consensus on a consensus basis which is basically everyone  
**[0:26:49-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:26:49):**  sort of agrees to at least go along with an idea.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:26:56):**  There still is a sort of indoctrination and socialization that everybody has about voting  
**[0:27:01-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:27:01):**  and win by one and as opposed to I'm willing to give in on that or I'm willing to go with  
**[0:27:10-0:27:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:27:10):**  that even though I don't necessarily agree with it.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:27:12):**  And so really co-housing the biggest I think the biggest challenge of co-housing is having  
**[0:27:17-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:27:17):**  to you know you come on campus here and you're in a co-housing community that's based on  
**[0:27:22-0:27:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:27:22):**  the shared values that's based on consensus decision making and then you step out of go  
**[0:27:28-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:27:28):**  outside leave campus and then if you want to do voting if you want to do you know continue  
**[0:27:36-0:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:27:36):**  to apply yourself to the top then go do that outside of the community.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:27:41):**  And so it's this whole notion of being able to walk in both worlds walk in two different  
**[0:27:45-0:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:27:45):**  worlds really.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:27:47):**  And I think that a lot of I would say that my experiences as people have a difficult  
**[0:27:51-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:27:51):**  time doing that at least my experience.  
**[0:27:54-0:27:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:27:54):**  And like I said for myself that's what I did.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:27:58):**  It's always been an easy transition to me for me to come to co-housing because I just  
**[0:28:03-0:28:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:28:03):**  you know I've always just lived.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:28:08):**  Individual and the secondary to the community.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:28:12):**  But I would tell you that that's not a case of view.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:28:18):**  That's a typical co-housing in that vein.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:28:21):**  The sort of extreme community first.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:28:26):**  I have lots of war stories but I don't want to you know incriminate or talk badly or poorly  
**[0:28:33-0:28:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:28:33):**  of my neighbor of my neighbors because we just had a situation like that last night  
**[0:28:38-0:28:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:28:38):**  at a community meeting.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:28:40):**  And so where there was a zero-sum game proposal and having to and having the minority group  
**[0:28:48-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:28:48):**  having to persuade the others to you know be less demanding.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:28:56):**  And so that I would say that you know one of the there's a whole industry called the  
**[0:29:03-0:29:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:29:03):**  co-housing industrial complex that includes you know these sort of soft skills and in  
**[0:29:09-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:29:09):**  fact I do a lot of the soft skill teaching not a lot but some soft skill teaching on  
**[0:29:13-0:29:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:29:13):**  consensus building and how to meeting facilitation and cultural competency and diversity.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:29:20):**  I do a lot of work around that for other communities.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:29:23):**  I teach and do workshops at the co-housing conferences on those topics because people  
**[0:29:29-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:29:29):**  really have to unlearn and unwind those tapes of you know 30, 40, 50, 60 years of socialization  
**[0:29:38-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:29:38):**  and this other system that's sort of totally antithetical to co-housing.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:29:43):**  Yeah I can imagine that's quite the uphill battle and for a lot of people a very difficult  
**[0:29:49-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:29:49):**  transition if they're not used to living like that.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:29:52):**  Now what are some of the most common reasons that these intentional communities fall apart  
**[0:29:58-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:29:58):**  or break up and afterwards let's talk about how you can sort of mitigate or plan ahead  
**[0:30:04-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:30:04):**  to prevent those things.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:30:06):**  I've never heard of a co-housing community falling apart.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:30:10):**  Once they make it once everyone in the community makes a commitment to move forward I mean  
**[0:30:17-0:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:30:17):**  it's you know it's this big stepping off the edge type of risk that people take and so  
**[0:30:24-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:30:24):**  here you are hanging around with 15 or 20 people who you know on a very limited basis  
**[0:30:34-0:30:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:30:34):**  and then you find out when you get together with them that they're this big control freak  
**[0:30:40-0:30:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:30:40):**  or they're totally passive and you can't get them to participate or whatever and so I think  
**[0:30:47-0:30:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:30:47):**  it's real I would say that the biggest pitfall is for communities or is communities that  
**[0:30:52-0:30:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:30:52):**  don't get to know their people ahead of time well enough because really what it is it's  
**[0:30:57-0:31:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:30:57):**  like running a family business but everybody lives on site and it's even your family members  
**[0:31:05-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:31:05):**  you really don't like and you still have to keep moving the ship forward and so it's a  
**[0:31:11-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:31:11):**  matter of I would say that the one thing the communities could do is to get to know their  
**[0:31:20-0:31:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:31:20):**  potential neighbors on a level more than just a superficial level so when I say superficial  
**[0:31:27-0:31:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:31:27):**  level it's like oh I like to go I like to go to the movies and oh I like to read oh  
**[0:31:33-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:31:33):**  I like to go hiking well the point is everybody likes to go to the movies everybody likes  
**[0:31:38-0:31:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:31:38):**  to read everybody likes to go hiking but what are but what are the what makes you tick are  
**[0:31:46-0:31:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:31:46):**  you you know do you have a have you taken the Myers-Briggs test and are you a I or are  
**[0:31:53-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:31:53):**  you a E are you a J or an S and so it's a matter of sight of getting people to know  
**[0:32:02-0:32:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:32:02):**  each other on a different level because you're really trying to it's more like a team like  
**[0:32:07-0:32:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:32:07):**  a and trying to figure out who the players are in your group and what are their best  
**[0:32:14-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:32:14):**  jobs that they what are they most I guess talented at for whatever jobs that are necessary  
**[0:32:20-0:32:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:32:20):**  to part make the community tick because it's not like oh let's wait let's trade Allen in  
**[0:32:26-0:32:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:32:26):**  for we need somebody who's better at at at tilling in the garden can't do that you have  
**[0:32:32-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:32:32):**  to use whoever your existing team is to make things happen and if and if and if and in  
**[0:32:39-0:32:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:32:39):**  getting people to kind of toe the line and understand how to work together and you know  
**[0:32:44-0:32:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:32:44):**  kind of a teamwork passion and I would say that that's one of the other challenges of  
**[0:32:51-0:32:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:32:51):**  of living in a community.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:32:53):**  I love some of those insights and the whole time you were explaining that I was just thinking  
**[0:32:57-0:33:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:32:57):**  this is probably really good advice for building any kind of intimate relationship a lot of  
**[0:33:02-0:33:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:33:02):**  those oh yeah why even just on a one on one basis.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:33:05):**  Yeah in fact I do a training a cultural competency training that includes there's I found this  
**[0:33:12-0:33:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:33:12):**  online Myers Briggs test that you can take on your cell phone and when you're with people  
**[0:33:17-0:33:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:33:17):**  who you really don't know very well like like at a conference or whatever people are willing  
**[0:33:22-0:33:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:33:22):**  to break that ice and take the test and talk a little bit about oh I'm an E that fits me  
**[0:33:28-0:33:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:33:28):**  just fine I'm an I that fits me just fine but before but and I think at the beginning  
**[0:33:34-0:33:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:33:34):**  of a community formation that's the time that you really get to know people like that because  
**[0:33:38-0:33:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:33:38):**  once you get down the road and once people start screwing up then it's kind of hard to  
**[0:33:43-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:33:43):**  backpedal that and it's better to be proactive and get to know who your people are ahead  
**[0:33:48-0:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:33:48):**  of time so that you know you can you can set your norms and expectations for your community  
**[0:33:55-0:33:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:33:55):**  saying that okay we're not going to put up with this we're not going to put up with this  
**[0:33:59-0:34:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:33:59):**  and we know that you're that you're a control person and so we really want you to watch  
**[0:34:05-0:34:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:34:05):**  that and so when you it's you just have to be really more open about those types of issues  
**[0:34:11-0:34:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:34:11):**  because it ends up being a big huge business we're running here we what do we got we 16  
**[0:34:15-0:34:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:34:15):**  units so we're talking about a you know a 10 million dollar business that we're trying  
**[0:34:19-0:34:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:34:19):**  to keep afloat with the value of the houses and you know what it costs to keep this this  
**[0:34:25-0:34:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:34:25):**  place so it's not like you just bought your house and the cul-de-sac and you drive in  
**[0:34:30-0:34:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:34:30):**  the garage and go inside and we never see you again until you have to you know go buy  
**[0:34:35-0:34:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:34:35):**  a carton of milk around here it's in co-housing it's it's a little bit than that.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:34:42):**  What tend to be the ideals and the intentions that really hold the community together even  
**[0:34:47-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:34:47):**  when issues come up?  
**[0:34:49-0:34:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:34:49):**  I think what it I think what it is is just this idea of we're in this together and I  
**[0:34:57-0:35:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:34:57):**  might not like you I might not like your decision or your idea but that doesn't mean I don't  
**[0:35:02-0:35:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:35:02):**  like you and so I think it's this notion of being able to not take things personally because  
**[0:35:10-0:35:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:35:10):**  anything that happens around here around decisions is all pretty much business decisions and  
**[0:35:15-0:35:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:35:15):**  so you know you get people who you know tend to together you know for whatever reason you  
**[0:35:22-0:35:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:35:22):**  know you have friends who that you like at work and you have friends who you're who you  
**[0:35:26-0:35:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:35:26):**  like in your neighborhood and you have people who you like to go to the ballgame with or  
**[0:35:30-0:35:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:35:30):**  whatever and it's the same thing here you know we have people who are with others that  
**[0:35:36-0:35:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:35:36):**  and not necessarily friends with everybody so it's not like we're trying to be the one's  
**[0:35:43-0:35:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:35:43):**  best friend when we're here and I think it's that whole idea of trust that I mean of don't  
**[0:35:51-0:35:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:35:51):**  take this personally and so there are some things I suppose are personal but at the same  
**[0:35:57-0:36:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:35:57):**  time the things that I think that we get into conflict and community that people get into  
**[0:36:02-0:36:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:36:02):**  conflict into in community about are things having to do with more of the business aspects  
**[0:36:06-0:36:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:36:06):**  of the community you know there's lots of ways to go from point A to point B and we  
**[0:36:13-0:36:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:36:13):**  argue over which is the best way to get there and so I think that the idea is that we're  
**[0:36:22-0:36:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:36:22):**  just trying to get to point A to point B and it shouldn't really matter how we get there  
**[0:36:26-0:36:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:36:26):**  if you want we'll go your way this time and so it's a matter of again kind of shedding  
**[0:36:32-0:36:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:36:32):**  the control or being okay with letting other people having to make it participating in  
**[0:36:38-0:36:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:36:38):**  the decisions and sharing the decision-making approach which is the basis of consensus and  
**[0:36:45-0:36:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:36:45):**  also sharing leadership I say that that's you know in high school you know there's always  
**[0:36:50-0:36:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:36:50):**  those kids that are in our every page on every page of the yearbook you know band one two  
**[0:36:55-0:37:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:36:55):**  three four football one two three four you know Future Farmers of America one two three four and the idea is to really try to get people to share those roles because it's easy to just let the guy who wants to be involved with everything or the woman who wants to be involved with everything do it all but what happens when they decide they're gonna back off what happens when they decide to move what happens if they when they die if there's been no  
**[0:37:24-0:37:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:37:24):**  shared lead up and there's been no I guess nurturing of succession so you know it's just like it's just like it's like in any kind of business atmosphere really my neighbors and others don't like this to say that we run a business here but ultimately it is  
**[0:37:44-0:37:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:37:44):**  That's an interesting observation and it makes me think what advice would you have for people who are considering getting into cohousing how should they prepare themselves and what are some resources that they could look into to learn more?  
**[0:37:59-0:38:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:37:59):**  Well these days because they're cohousing is going to be a little bit more I guess recognizable or mainstream you know we show up on the New York Times and we show up on NPR and we show up on public broadcasting PBS and so it's not necessarily an anomaly that it once was and so I think it's easy enough to go and kick the tires  
**[0:38:26-0:38:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:38:26):**  We for instance at our place we have four places that are for sale all of a sudden and so we have people coming in and sort of test driving the place and looking around and coming to our community dinners and attending the community meetings and just you know kind of hanging out in cohousing and most places most cohousing communities have a guest room and so when you're out traveling around you can say hey I'd like to come stay in your guest room maybe check out your community and kind of see what this cohousing  
**[0:38:55-0:39:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:38:55):**  So there's a way to kind of best drive cohousing and I think that's something that's relatively new compared to maybe you know eight or ten years ago so there's that way to find out about cohousing and I'd say that the broadest form of information comes from the cohousing association of the United States and so as I mentioned there's you know there's no other housing configuration who has  
**[0:39:24-0:39:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:39:24):**  an association where we actually network around and create space for people to talk about their experiences and you know the cohousing association isn't your typical non-profit you know we're not stomping out cancer and we're not you know finding dogs there you know forever home and we're not saving whales or any of that kind of stuff  
**[0:39:44-0:39:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:39:44):**  but we do make the world into a better place because we work directly with people of all ilks we help people build communities you know they're great places for kids to grow up healthy and strong  
**[0:39:55-0:40:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:39:55):**  they're against loneliness you know they're data that show that loneliness is more dangerous and deadly than smoking 15 cigarettes a day and so cohousing also provides safe places for everybody to age in place and so  
**[0:40:10-0:40:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:40:10):**  the association really is the place to go if you're interested in finding information about cohousing and we have these web chats that happen a couple times a month where it's free to dial into zoom and you can hear an expert talk about cohousing in fact  
**[0:40:28-0:40:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:40:28):**  I did one last night that was about the road that cohousing that's kind of my drum that I've been beaten lately and so we have a conference that's coming up in Portland Oregon on the 29th of May 30th of May through June 2nd and people are encouraged to check that out and come out to Portland it's a nice place to go look  
**[0:40:52-0:41:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:40:52):**  just as a tourist and come and find out about cohousing and so our website is cohousing.org so it's pretty easy to find and there's a section on there about the conference and there's all kinds of information about cohousing there's a directory of all the cohousing communities around the country and  
**[0:41:15-0:41:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:41:15):**  blogs and information and all kinds of stuff about anything you want us to know about cohousing and we're afraid to ask.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:41:23):**  Wonderful Alan those are all really great resources that will get people started now before I let you go can I ask you one more question what do you think is the sort of the biggest potential the brightest future for cohousing moving forward into the modern context?  
**[0:41:40-0:42:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:41:40):**  I think I think cohousing I'm convinced that cohousing is a strong I think cohousing is a way to bridge the cultural divides that are a bit so prevalent in our country today because it intentionally brings people together of all ilks to talk about in a safe space some of the things that divide us some of the issues that come to that are divisive  
**[0:42:06-0:42:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:42:06):**  and it's a group of people who are willing to take action to help bridge those cultural divides and so it's a matter of you know it doesn't happen overnight cohousing has not hit that tipping point yet I don't think and I am confident that with podcasts such as you're offering here and conferences that we offer through cohousing and the communities that are  
**[0:42:34-0:42:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:42:34):**  in formation and the ones that are existing the ones that are just ideas in people's heads I think those are the those are the things that are going to really push cohousing into the mainstream and make the world a better place one community at a time.  
**[0:42:54-0:43:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:42:54):**  I love it awesome Alan thank you so much for taking time to chat with us and explain more about what you do and what you promote cohousing has really caught my interest in the last couple of months especially in the larger context of what it can do for the health of communities and the environment around them.  
**[0:43:10-0:43:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:43:10):**  So yeah I really encourage you listeners out there to check out the resources that Alan mentioned above and I will also add these links to the show notes for this podcast episode as well when this goes live so Alan again thank you for your time I hope we can stay in touch and I'll definitely reach out to you again at a later date.  
**[0:43:28-0:43:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:43:28):**  And also Guatemala would be a good place to try cohousing because it's already kind of tribal their cultures already in place that are already more familial and.  
**[0:43:40-0:44:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:43:40):**  It would fit in would fit in really well I did I make documentary movies on the for what I really do and I made three of them about cohousing and one of them I was in South Africa and did one about tribalism and traditions and culture and places like Guatemala would be a great place for a natural fit for cohousing.  
**[0:44:01-0:44:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:44:01):**  I'm actually really glad you brought that up I was going to say anything especially not on the podcast but it's definitely an option that I'm considering with some friends and developers of mine here looking into the possibility of developing a cohousing community around a permaculture ecosystem as well.  
**[0:44:18-0:44:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:44:18):**  So yeah I hear what you're saying I think there's a ton of potential here and when I kind of form that idea a little bit more perhaps I'll put this out to the larger community from the listeners on the podcast.  
**[0:44:29-0:44:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:44:29):**  Yeah so do you have a or is it going to be for expats or is it you're going to be for local people.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:44:34):**  I mean we're still really early in the exploration and business modeling stages so definitely as the idea starts to form and become a little more concrete I'll reach out to you again and see if you have any advice on the structure that we might be able to follow.  
**[0:44:48-0:44:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:44:48):**  Oh yeah I would definitely be interested in working with you on that.  
**[0:44:52-0:44:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alan-ohashi/#t=0:44:52):**  Very cool.

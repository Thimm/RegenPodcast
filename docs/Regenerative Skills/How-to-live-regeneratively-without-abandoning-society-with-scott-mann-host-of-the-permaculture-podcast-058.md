**[0:00:00-0:00:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:03-0:00:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:00:03):**  Here we dive deep into the worlds of permaculture, natural building, and regenerative living  
**[0:00:07-0:00:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:00:07):**  as we aspire to help you reach your highest potential for yourself, for your community,  
**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:00:12):**  and for this beautiful planet that we all share.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:00:14):**  As always, I'm your host Oliver Gaucher, and I have a great session for you in this week's  
**[0:00:18-0:00:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:00:18):**  episode, so let's jump right in!  
**[0:00:30-0:00:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:00:30):**  Are you looking for the best resources to help you build a regenerative lifestyle?  
**[0:00:35-0:00:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:00:35):**  New Society Publishers has been a leader in sustainable publishing for over 30 years.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:00:39):**  They publish good news and solutions for individuals and organizations seeking to change their  
**[0:00:43-0:00:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:00:43):**  lives so that they may change the world for the better.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:00:47):**  Their company mandate goes far beyond the single bottom line of profit.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:00:50):**  They care deeply not only about what they publish, but also how they do business.  
**[0:00:55-0:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:00:55):**  They believe in the authors that they take on and the works that they bring to the marketplace.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:00:59):**  From sustainable living to progressive parenting, New Society Publishers has the books you need  
**[0:01:04-0:01:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:01:04):**  to help build a better world.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:01:06):**  Buy your print and ebooks online at www.newsociety.com or at fine bookstores near you.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:01:13):**  Alright, now in keeping with my kick on finding new and unique ways to implement permaculture  
**[0:01:18-0:01:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:01:18):**  principles and design techniques in ways outside of just land management and natural building,  
**[0:01:23-0:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:01:23):**  I've got an excellent guest for you today.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:01:25):**  You probably know Scott Mann as the host of the Permaculture Podcast, the longest running  
**[0:01:30-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:01:30):**  podcast on permaculture which has been going strong now for more than 7 years.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:01:35):**  In that time, he has gained remarkable insights from some of the most prominent leaders and  
**[0:01:39-0:01:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:01:39):**  change makers in the regenerative economy.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:01:41):**  Today, I'll be asking Scott about the changes that he's made in his own lifestyle through  
**[0:01:46-0:01:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:01:46):**  his consumer habits, his daily routines and behavior, as well as his interactions with  
**[0:01:50-0:01:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:01:50):**  his community and environment.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:01:53):**  We talk in depth about how abandoning society and moving to the country is often not as  
**[0:01:58-0:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:01:58):**  effective a form of living regeneratively as you might think.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:02:01):**  We discuss how to avoid the burnout that can come from too many ethical dilemmas which  
**[0:02:05-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:02:05):**  arise from living in a destructive social system and a few of the many steps that you  
**[0:02:09-0:02:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:02:09):**  can use to overcome the stress.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:02:11):**  We also touch on some practical advice on how to make your money count in a consumer  
**[0:02:15-0:02:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:02:15):**  environment with so many destructive options.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:02:18):**  This is a great episode for those of you listeners who love your locations and jobs but want  
**[0:02:22-0:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:02:22):**  to take steps towards healthier, more holistic living without a huge upheaval in abandoning  
**[0:02:27-0:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:02:27):**  everything.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:02:28):**  So, before I give it all away, let me turn things over to Scott Mann.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:02:32):**  Hey Scott, thanks so much for taking the time to be on the podcast today.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:02:35):**  How are you doing?  
**[0:02:36-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:02:36):**  I'm doing pretty good.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:02:38):**  Thanks for having me on today Oliver.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:02:39):**  Hey, it's my pleasure.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:02:40):**  I know we've got a lot of stuff that I want to talk to you about today, so what do you  
**[0:02:44-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:02:44):**  say we just jump right into the questions?  
**[0:02:46-0:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:02:46):**  Yeah, let's go ahead and roll with it.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:02:48):**  Where do you want to begin?  
**[0:02:49-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:02:49):**  Well, if you could start by telling us a little bit about your background, how you first became  
**[0:02:53-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:02:53):**  interested in permaculture and some of the progression about how you turned it into a  
**[0:02:58-0:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:02:58):**  profession and a lifestyle.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:03:01):**  Oh man, where should I begin?  
**[0:03:04-0:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:03:04):**  I've been thinking about this a lot as I consider where we kind of develop our love for the  
**[0:03:09-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:03:09):**  outside world.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:03:10):**  And, so of course as a child I was spending a lot of time out there doing those kinds  
**[0:03:13-0:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:03:13):**  of things where it was hiking and camping and fishing, cub scouts, boy scouts, things  
**[0:03:18-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:03:18):**  like that that really got me engaged with the hills and waters here in Appalachia on  
**[0:03:27-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:03:27):**  the mid-Atlantic.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:03:29):**  And then from there it was, as I was a bit older, I was an intern at a US Coast Guard  
**[0:03:34-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:03:34):**  facility during my teens, 18, 19, 20.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:03:36):**  I was originally a computer science major when I was in college the first time through  
**[0:03:41-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:03:41):**  and so was interning at this facility.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:03:44):**  And though I know not everyone will remember these days anymore as we're in 2018 now, there  
**[0:03:49-0:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:03:49):**  during the late 90s there was this big concern about Y2K and that when we would transition  
**[0:03:55-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:03:55):**  from the 20th century into the 21st whether or not our computer systems and things would  
**[0:04:02-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:04:02):**  work because of date codes and things like that that we would go to this double zero  
**[0:04:07-0:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:04:07):**  and then things would be kind of confused.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:04:08):**  And as I was watching the government in the United States prepare for those kinds of changes  
**[0:04:14-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:04:14):**  it made me wonder how would just regular people, civilians, prepare for this kind of change  
**[0:04:19-0:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:04:19):**  if there was some kind of a disaster.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:04:21):**  And of course during that time there was a lot of the militia movement and the back to  
**[0:04:27-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:04:27):**  the land and survivalist kind of folks who were taking this very small group and individual  
**[0:04:32-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:04:32):**  dynamic approach to disaster preparedness.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:04:35):**  And there was just something about that that didn't seem right coming from a large family  
**[0:04:38-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:04:38):**  where you know we could go to my grandmothers and there'd be 70 to 100 people for a large  
**[0:04:42-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:04:42):**  cookout that I was all related to.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:04:44):**  And so I started looking for sustainable solutions to disasters and that's around the time that  
**[0:04:51-0:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:04:51):**  I first encountered Bill Mollison's designer's manual.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:04:55):**  And there was just a little bit of information about permaculture on the web at that time.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:05:00):**  And I guess like so many people you get some of this information it's really interesting  
**[0:05:04-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:05:04):**  and then what you're preparing for doesn't happen.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:05:08):**  And you know Y2K was not any kind of a big blip and that information that I had found  
**[0:05:13-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:05:13):**  kind of went onto a back shelf.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:05:16):**  And then it was a number of years later I was still kind of interested in that idea  
**[0:05:20-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:05:20):**  that word permaculture carried with me through the years.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:05:23):**  And it was around I don't know 2008 or 2009 that I started looking for a permaculture  
**[0:05:31-0:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:05:31):**  design course but it was one of those where I always seem to have the time or the money  
**[0:05:36-0:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:05:36):**  but never both.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:05:37):**  And then finally in 2010 I found a local permaculture design course that was being offered in Lancaster  
**[0:05:43-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:05:43):**  Pennsylvania by some friends of mine now friends at Susquehanna Permaculture.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:05:49):**  And they were doing this hybrid weekend kind of approach that was really affordable so  
**[0:05:53-0:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:05:53):**  I went ahead and took my PDC.  
**[0:05:55-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:05:55):**  And during that time because of my background in IT over those years and having spent some  
**[0:06:00-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:06:00):**  time as a radio DJ it just kind of made sense that there was this niche to fill.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:06:06):**  And as a result I started the permaculture podcast which is now given the numbers that  
**[0:06:11-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:06:11):**  I hear from other folks you know one of the number one or number two podcasts on sustainability  
**[0:06:17-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:06:17):**  or regenerative practices.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:06:19):**  And as far as I can tell is also now the longest running show on permaculture with over seven  
**[0:06:24-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:06:24):**  years to date.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:06:25):**  Marvelous.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:06:26):**  Yeah that's remarkable.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:06:27):**  I think a lot of people can relate to those interests and motivations that originally  
**[0:06:33-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:06:33):**  got you into this focus.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:06:35):**  Now you and I both talk a lot about the fact that pretty much all of the solutions all  
**[0:06:42-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:06:42):**  of the technological fixes and advancements are already existent already in place that  
**[0:06:48-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:06:48):**  would give anybody the tools and the resources that they need to transition into a regenerative  
**[0:06:53-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:06:53):**  lifestyle or a regenerative production method if that's their business model.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:06:58):**  However the difficulty runs in in getting the willpower getting the social momentum  
**[0:07:04-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:07:04):**  to actually implement those changes and empower people to realize that they already have what  
**[0:07:10-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:07:10):**  they need to move forward.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:07:12):**  And I know this is something that you're very passionate about finding solutions for on  
**[0:07:16-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:07:16):**  the social side of things.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:07:18):**  Could you talk a little bit about sort of the challenges that come up when it comes  
**[0:07:24-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:07:24):**  to making social shifts in the right direction and bringing up the momentum that's required  
**[0:07:30-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:07:30):**  to move in the right direction.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:07:32):**  Oh I knew you were going to ask me some big questions but that's quite a can of worms  
**[0:07:38-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:07:38):**  to get into when we look at those kinds of issues both from a personal perspective and  
**[0:07:44-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:07:44):**  what we can do as individuals and then the way that that moves into our larger cultural  
**[0:07:49-0:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:07:49):**  and social community shifts.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:07:52):**  Certainly yeah let's break it down piece by piece then.  
**[0:07:55-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:07:55):**  All right.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:07:56):**  When I think about the individual side there's this idea that was presented to me by David.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:08:04):**  There's this idea that was presented to me by Dave Jackie a number of years ago when  
**[0:08:07-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:08:07):**  we were doing a roundtable discussion where we started talking about the difference between  
**[0:08:12-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:08:12):**  the things that we say we care about and then the actions that we actually take which are  
**[0:08:17-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:08:17):**  as he referred to them our espoused values and our governing values.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:08:23):**  And as I looked at that I started to think about the things that I would talk about my  
**[0:08:30-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:08:30):**  being my interest in the things that I cared about and then what was I actually doing as  
**[0:08:34-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:08:34):**  I was talking about this with Ethan Hughes of the Possibility Alliance who lives on a  
**[0:08:38-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:08:38):**  gasoline free electricity free farm in Missouri and is really a deep example of what it can  
**[0:08:44-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:08:44):**  be to embrace what it is that we value.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:08:49):**  He started talking about the difference between those two things as our integrity gap and  
**[0:08:53-0:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:08:53):**  it's not presented to say that we're lacking integrity by there being a distinction between  
**[0:08:59-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:08:59):**  what we say and what we do but that in the world that we live in it can be difficult  
**[0:09:08-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:09:08):**  to bring those things together because of the social pressures that we have.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:09:12):**  You know we live in a world where it's virtually impossible to be near all of the resources  
**[0:09:17-0:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:09:17):**  that we might use that we're still going to be having things delivered to us or having  
**[0:09:21-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:09:21):**  to go out to get them because the land that's required to live regeneratively just isn't  
**[0:09:26-0:09:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:09:26):**  available.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:09:27):**  So as we look at that space between the two what can we do to bring them in a line with  
**[0:09:35-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:09:35):**  each other.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:09:36):**  And for me that's been a large part of my personal transformation as I embrace permaculture  
**[0:09:40-0:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:09:40):**  and live in this way is trying to figure out the ways to bring those things together.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:09:45):**  And in doing so by making decisions like buying from a farmer's market avoiding buying new  
**[0:09:50-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:09:50):**  wherever possible and making decisions as a consumer it allows me to kind of withdraw  
**[0:09:56-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:09:56):**  from the consumptive marketplace and then begin to spend my dollars where they really  
**[0:10:01-0:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:10:01):**  matter and vote as a consumer with my spending power.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:10:07):**  And that's become more and more interesting to me because of listening to people like  
**[0:10:10-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:10:10):**  Karan Olson Ramanujan who talks about a 30 percent solution where if we start and get  
**[0:10:15-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:10:15):**  like 30 percent of people to start talking about these different things that are meaningful  
**[0:10:20-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:10:20):**  to us and the way that we're living that we can really begin to shift the conversation.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:10:26):**  And Karan's numbers are kind of high compared to some others that I've heard whereas like  
**[0:10:29-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:10:29):**  David Holmgren is saying now through some of his work and a presentation that he gave  
**[0:10:33-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:10:33):**  at IPC in 2017 that it could be as little as 10 or 15 percent of people beginning to  
**[0:10:38-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:10:38):**  shift in this direction can have a huge impact on the decisions that are being made by corporations  
**[0:10:45-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:10:45):**  and business when it comes to things like sustainable energy sustainable practices single  
**[0:10:52-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:10:52):**  use plastics things like we're seeing from some manufacturers now with frustration free  
**[0:10:57-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:10:57):**  packaging which is you know just a simple cardboard box with which whatever it is that  
**[0:11:01-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:11:01):**  you're buying shoved into it and that as we make these kinds of decisions in our personal  
**[0:11:07-0:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:11:07):**  life about what we will and won't stand for that it has these effects then that ripple  
**[0:11:11-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:11:11):**  ever outward into our society.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:11:13):**  And there's when it comes to that society side and our culture and community there's  
**[0:11:18-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:11:18):**  something that David Holmgren said to me a number of years ago in one of my interviews  
**[0:11:22-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:11:22):**  with him was that it's not about trying to take the people who are not interested in  
**[0:11:28-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:11:28):**  these things and bring them into our fold but getting those people who are already on  
**[0:11:33-0:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:11:33):**  the fence who have these interests in sustainability or regenerative practices and to show them  
**[0:11:40-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:11:40):**  that there's a way and that for those of us who are already embedded in these ideas yourself  
**[0:11:44-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:11:44):**  myself your listeners mine that by bringing in our friends and family or when we go to  
**[0:11:49-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:11:49):**  an event and we're talking to some people who are interested in these ideas maybe it's  
**[0:11:52-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:11:52):**  their first time at a permaculture convergence or a workshop on gardening if we take those  
**[0:11:57-0:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:11:57):**  folks who have expressed this interest and bring them in then they're the ones who will  
**[0:12:02-0:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:12:02):**  take the next step and bring their co-workers closer to these ideas and all we really have  
**[0:12:06-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:12:06):**  to do in the end is continue to narrow that integrity gap and be models for other people  
**[0:12:13-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:12:13):**  who are interested in what it is that we're doing.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:12:17):**  I love how you mentioned the different decisions that we face as consumers having a big impact  
**[0:12:23-0:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:12:23):**  on the steps that we can take towards more regenerative lifestyle practices. Now the  
**[0:12:27-0:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:12:27):**  flip side for that and the difficulty that I've heard from others and certainly experienced  
**[0:12:32-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:12:32):**  myself is the concept of decision fatigue especially when we're living in these cultures  
**[0:12:38-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:12:38):**  that the default mode is destructive and it's very hard to operate outside of the society  
**[0:12:44-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:12:44):**  and the infrastructure that you know we live in.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:12:48):**  It's very easy to get burned out by thinking OK I might be making some some good consumer  
**[0:12:53-0:12:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:12:53):**  decisions over here I may be recycling maybe composting some of my waste but you know just  
**[0:12:59-0:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:12:59):**  getting completely fatigued by how many decisions it requires in order to operate outside of  
**[0:13:05-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:13:05):**  a destructive system. Do you have any advice for people who are facing this type of decision  
**[0:13:10-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:13:10):**  fatigue and how they might be able to break it down into manageable steps that don't cause  
**[0:13:14-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:13:14):**  them to become apathetic and kind of give up on making any kind of progress.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:13:20):**  As someone who lives this way full time I can completely understand that kind of fatigue  
**[0:13:25-0:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:13:25):**  because it can be exhausting and I'd like to just address that from the front of this  
**[0:13:30-0:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:13:30):**  that it happens and there are some days where as we go through these processes that it may  
**[0:13:35-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:13:35):**  just be easier to buy that cheeseburger from the restaurant and move forward even though  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:13:41):**  you know that it's not necessarily a decision that you want to make and it's something that  
**[0:13:46-0:13:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:13:46):**  Taj Shukluna the perma pixie talks about is that she would like us to in some ways talk  
**[0:13:52-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:13:52):**  about how we're in a period of transition and almost to think of that as one of the  
**[0:13:57-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:13:57):**  ethics that we might adopt when we're moving towards more regenerative practices because  
**[0:14:02-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:14:02):**  realizing that we're in that space allows us to forgive ourselves. And I think that  
**[0:14:06-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:14:06):**  that's one of those really important things that we can do as we do this is to know that  
**[0:14:11-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:14:11):**  we're not always going to be able to make the best decision and that's okay because  
**[0:14:16-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:14:16):**  we're not in a place that we always can. But for those folks who are making these decisions  
**[0:14:20-0:14:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:14:20):**  and these choices I feel that it's really important to pick what it is that you're going  
**[0:14:26-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:14:26):**  to do today this week or this month and it's just to choose one or two simple practices  
**[0:14:33-0:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:14:33):**  that you can begin integrating into your life and focus on that and maybe that means that  
**[0:14:39-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:14:39):**  you're going to begin purchasing more things second hand and going used and that can be  
**[0:14:45-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:14:45):**  as simple as using your thrift stores or your charity shops and maybe some of them locally  
**[0:14:51-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:14:51):**  to you don't make the kinds of decisions that you would necessarily care for because of  
**[0:14:57-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:14:57):**  the political practices that they engage in where they spend the money that they're collecting  
**[0:15:02-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:15:02):**  from you as a consumer but that's okay because that's a different conversation and I've thought  
**[0:15:08-0:15:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:15:08):**  about this sometimes that for many people because of where they live in a rural environment  
**[0:15:12-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:15:12):**  place like Walmart may not be the only place that they really have to shop for many of  
**[0:15:17-0:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:15:17):**  these things and it's the choice that they go to a store right next to them that they  
**[0:15:22-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:15:22):**  can go in and do their shopping at and support them the people in their community who work  
**[0:15:25-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:15:25):**  there versus ordering something online and having it shipped to them and that's a personal  
**[0:15:29-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:15:29):**  decision that they have to make and it's okay to do some of that big box shopping if that's  
**[0:15:36-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:15:36):**  the space that you're in even if you might not agree with their labor practices because  
**[0:15:40-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:15:40):**  fighting against those labor practices is different from your day to day needs but those  
**[0:15:47-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:15:47):**  are kinds of big picture what you were saying about the small and break it down with what  
**[0:15:50-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:15:50):**  I was saying about one or two practices for me right now it's like I was speaking with  
**[0:15:55-0:15:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:15:55):**  Paul Hellyer a fair food forager and he and I are talking about how do we integrate a  
**[0:15:58-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:15:58):**  lot of these things into our life and one of his big things is single-use plastic and  
**[0:16:03-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:16:03):**  it reminded me of all of these water bottles that I've had over the years that are reusable  
**[0:16:07-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:16:07):**  but I can't really clean them out and so it was looking for a good solution for any environment  
**[0:16:13-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:16:13):**  that I'm in whether I want one thing for coffee one thing for water juice whatever and so  
**[0:16:19-0:16:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:16:19):**  finally use that single-use plastic idea and wanting something reusable to find myself  
**[0:16:26-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:16:26):**  an appropriate container and you know that may have taken me days to do and seemed much  
**[0:16:32-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:16:32):**  harder than it should have been at the front but now that I've taken care of that I now  
**[0:16:35-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:16:35):**  have something durable that fits that need and now I can move on to my next project and  
**[0:16:43-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:16:43):**  my next idea of what I want to integrate into my life and for me that's reducing my fossil  
**[0:16:48-0:16:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:16:48):**  fuel needs which of course is a very big picture but that's my next fight now that I solved  
**[0:16:54-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:16:54):**  this reusable drink container in my life and I think that everybody can do really well  
**[0:17:00-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:17:00):**  just to find a couple of those things you know looking at where you live and can you  
**[0:17:05-0:17:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:17:05):**  combine shopping trips so that you're not making a lot of stops all the time or is there  
**[0:17:12-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:17:12):**  a route that you take to work that you might be able to change so you can run some errands  
**[0:17:16-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:17:16):**  on the way to or on the way home to reduce your fuel needs as well as perhaps the time  
**[0:17:24-0:17:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:17:24):**  that you're spending out so that then you free up more time for other projects and just  
**[0:17:28-0:17:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:17:28):**  yeah using your creativity to do this as you find one thing establish a solution and then  
**[0:17:37-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:17:37):**  kind of ship I don't want to say shelve that but inhabit that and live into that solution  
**[0:17:42-0:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:17:42):**  and then move on to the next problem you're facing.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:17:46):**  I think those are some great insights and you know like you mentioned this is going  
**[0:17:49-0:17:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:17:49):**  to be different for every person and the factors are going to change depending on where they  
**[0:17:53-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:17:53):**  live what their lifestyle is like how many people they're supporting and so on and so  
**[0:17:57-0:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:17:57):**  on the variables are infinite. I know for myself that I've found a lot of progress being  
**[0:18:04-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:18:04):**  made a lot faster by kind of systematizing the amount of decisions especially the small  
**[0:18:09-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:18:09):**  ones that I make on a daily basis. So you know there's tons of online resources on how  
**[0:18:15-0:18:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:18:15):**  to do this but the way it's looked like for me mostly is just by putting in routines and  
**[0:18:20-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:18:20):**  having lists of things that I do fairly consistently every week. Obviously with a little bit of  
**[0:18:24-0:18:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:18:24):**  wiggle room you don't want to be too rigid but like always leaving the house with a couple  
**[0:18:30-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:18:30):**  of reusable bags so that you don't find yourself in a pinch at a store and have to use you  
**[0:18:35-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:18:35):**  know those single uses that they give you. I'm even getting down to the point where I'm  
**[0:18:39-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:18:39):**  considering just doing a uniform so that I don't have to make the decision of like what  
**[0:18:45-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:18:45):**  am I going to wear every day. Do I need to you know buy other bits articles of clothing  
**[0:18:51-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:18:51):**  that come from either questionable sources or things or companies that I don't want to  
**[0:18:54-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:18:54):**  support but really trying to get all of those kind of monotonous reoccurring decisions that  
**[0:19:02-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:19:02):**  contribute to fatigue because you're you're constantly making those small decisions again  
**[0:19:06-0:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:19:06):**  day in and day out. Once they become systematized and a bit more routine within a few months  
**[0:19:13-0:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:19:13):**  they quickly become your new default. And once that happens you free up a lot of mental  
**[0:19:18-0:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:19:18):**  space to either make larger decisions or to work on some of the weak points in your lifestyle  
**[0:19:23-0:19:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:19:23):**  that you try to improve on. At least that's helped me out a lot.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:19:26):**  Yeah and I've done a lot of that too. I remember when I was a kid it was funny you know you  
**[0:19:31-0:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:19:31):**  went toys and everything when you're young and you look forward to what's going to be  
**[0:19:37-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:19:37):**  unique or interesting you might receive throughout the year. But as I got older my grandmother  
**[0:19:42-0:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:19:42):**  would always kind of do a resupply run for me for Christmas. And it was you know that  
**[0:19:47-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:19:47):**  joke of getting socks and underwear. But I actually kind of look forward to that because  
**[0:19:50-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:19:50):**  that was something that took those kinds of things off the list of what I had to be concerned  
**[0:19:54-0:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:19:54):**  about. And I've kind of adopted that in my own life that when I need to replace you know  
**[0:20:00-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:20:00):**  articles of clothing as they wear out or other things like that that it's become a process  
**[0:20:04-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:20:04):**  where it's like this once a year kind of thing. Those pieces that I can stock up on or anything  
**[0:20:09-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:20:09):**  like that become like an annual or by annual purchase. And then that's one thing that I  
**[0:20:15-0:20:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:20:15):**  don't have to worry about. And similarly similarly to the routine you know it's one day a week  
**[0:20:20-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:20:20):**  where I'm doing laundry and taking care of all those things at once. I'd love to do some  
**[0:20:24-0:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:20:24):**  of the meal prep stuff that folks talk about. They haven't quite got there. But yeah I find  
**[0:20:28-0:20:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:20:28):**  that those kinds of things that uniform idea are very helpful for removing those minute  
**[0:20:35-0:20:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:20:35):**  decisions that we take and work through every day that kind of tick away at our ability  
**[0:20:43-0:20:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:20:43):**  to think. I joke sometime with some with friends who are in the IT community in particular  
**[0:20:49-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:20:49):**  that it's like we only have so many brain cycles a day before we kind of run out and  
**[0:20:53-0:20:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:20:53):**  get exhausted. So how can we maximize the number of those that we're able to use and  
**[0:20:57-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:20:57):**  doing these kinds of things where we integrate these decisions into our lives give us more  
**[0:21:02-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:21:02):**  opportunity to take advantage of the time that we have available to us.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:21:08):**  Yeah absolutely. Now I know you also have a pretty unique criteria for how you evaluate  
**[0:21:14-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:21:14):**  when it is you need new stuff and when you're making purchases. You had a fantastic phrase  
**[0:21:22-0:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:21:22):**  which we talked about last time which is I am too poor to buy cheap things. Could you  
**[0:21:27-0:21:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:21:27):**  elaborate on that and talk a little bit about that process that you go through when you're  
**[0:21:32-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:21:32):**  making consumer decisions. Well that line I don't know where it originally  
**[0:21:39-0:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:21:39):**  comes from but it was Wilson Alvarez of Rebel Garden Tools and he also teaches with Susquehanna  
**[0:21:46-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:21:46):**  Permaculture and he's been a guest on my show a number of times a great rewilder and he  
**[0:21:52-0:21:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:21:52):**  shared that with me. And I like that idea because it pushes me towards looking for something  
**[0:21:57-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:21:57):**  that's the right value so that I'm spending the limited amount of resources that I do  
**[0:22:04-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:22:04):**  have because I live in the gift economy. And you know my work as a podcast and a permaculture  
**[0:22:09-0:22:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:22:09):**  practitioner is all in this space where I'm not really in most cases charging anyone for  
**[0:22:14-0:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:22:14):**  anything. It's through just an exchange where I'm providing what it is that I do to others  
**[0:22:19-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:22:19):**  and then ask them to help me meet my needs. I just finished my taxes and it was I was  
**[0:22:24-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:22:24):**  able to produce my show and live and do everything that I do on just over twelve thousand dollars  
**[0:22:29-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:22:29):**  gross for 2017. So when you're working with those kinds of resources in the United States  
**[0:22:34-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:22:34):**  where it's less than half of what an individual income is then it requires you to make different  
**[0:22:42-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:22:42):**  decisions and that's where this idea of being too poor to buy cheap things comes in. So  
**[0:22:46-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:22:46):**  it is about buying things that are known to be durable or if they are known to be durable  
**[0:22:55-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:22:55):**  then also being able to repair them or looking for things that are known to last a lifetime.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:23:02):**  And so those are the kinds of things that I look for and then also am not unwilling  
**[0:23:09-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:23:09):**  to spend more money for something that may be substantially in some cases more expensive  
**[0:23:15-0:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:23:15):**  than something that I can just go readily acquire in order to have that piece that really  
**[0:23:19-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:23:19):**  is that right mix between the cost financially and also the lifetime in which that item or  
**[0:23:28-0:23:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:23:28):**  object will last. And so once I've kind of decided what the right value is for something  
**[0:23:36-0:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:23:36):**  and you know for clothing and things that tends to be much lower perhaps than a good  
**[0:23:40-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:23:40):**  garden tool where I would consider spending substantially more because this is something  
**[0:23:46-0:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:23:46):**  that will last a lifetime. Something that is likely to wear out within a couple of years  
**[0:23:51-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:23:51):**  just through regular use regardless of the quality of the item kind of changes the way  
**[0:23:57-0:24:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:23:57):**  that I might look at what that price point versus durability is. And the way that I consider  
**[0:24:04-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:24:04):**  a lot of these things when I'm looking for something is the first thing that I'll always  
**[0:24:08-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:24:08):**  do is a Google search and I'll just hop online and it's usually like something as simple  
**[0:24:13-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:24:13):**  as best cargo pants 2018 and I'll look for whatever list is available that gives me you  
**[0:24:19-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:24:19):**  know what certain brands are and read through what people have to say about these things  
**[0:24:23-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:24:23):**  and then look for something that is within the range of what I'm willing to spend. And  
**[0:24:27-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:24:27):**  so maybe for a pair of pants that might be thirty five to fifty dollars because I can  
**[0:24:32-0:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:24:32):**  expect to get three to seven years depending on what I'm using them for. And then that  
**[0:24:38-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:24:38):**  will point me towards particular brands you know in the United States Carhartt is very  
**[0:24:44-0:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:24:44):**  well known for its durability. Wrangler has a work line that is also known for being durable  
**[0:24:51-0:24:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:24:51):**  and so you know between those kinds of things and that search will get me towards that quality  
**[0:24:56-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:24:56):**  and value and price point. I also like those kinds of articles because I don't want to  
**[0:25:00-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:25:00):**  spend hours and hours and hours trying to figure out what the right items are and it's  
**[0:25:06-0:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:25:06):**  real easy when you want to make a good decision where trying to make the perfect decision  
**[0:25:12-0:25:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:25:12):**  becomes the enemy of being able to make that choice. And so doing that quick Google search  
**[0:25:18-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:25:18):**  getting a list of just a couple of items really narrows down my focus and so I'm not spending  
**[0:25:24-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:25:24):**  hour after hour kind of drilling down on this. And then once I kind of find what that right  
**[0:25:29-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:25:29):**  value is I'll start looking for what I can find second hand. You know whether that's  
**[0:25:36-0:25:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:25:36):**  eBay or looking locally running through my thrift stores checking Craigslist I always  
**[0:25:41-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:25:41):**  try to find something second hand if it's going to be more than five or ten dollars  
**[0:25:45-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:25:45):**  and a quick stop on one of my regular errands. Once I'm kind of go through that though of  
**[0:25:51-0:25:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:25:51):**  value and quality versus second hand after that point if I can't find it second hand  
**[0:25:58-0:26:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:25:58):**  then I'll consider buying wherever I can find it at that point because again I don't have  
**[0:26:04-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:26:04):**  hours and hours and hours to try to find what it is that I'm looking for because not only  
**[0:26:09-0:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:26:09):**  am I trying to find something of the right value I also value my time as well. And so  
**[0:26:15-0:26:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:26:15):**  trying to find something that is a low dollar figure item which for me is really less than  
**[0:26:20-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:26:20):**  like one hundred dollars it's not worth spending more than about a half an hour forty five  
**[0:26:23-0:26:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:26:23):**  minutes researching something. And so it's you know that quick online find it next time  
**[0:26:29-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:26:29):**  I'm out with my kids if we're going clothes shopping something swinging in checking the  
**[0:26:33-0:26:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:26:33):**  second hand store take five or ten minutes on Craigslist scan through eBay real quick.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:26:37):**  And if I haven't found it by then and I don't have a local store I can buy it then that's  
**[0:26:41-0:26:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:26:41):**  when we're going to go ahead and make a consumer choice online.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:26:45):**  Nice yeah that's a very useful criteria that I think a lot of people could realistically  
**[0:26:48-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:26:48):**  mimic and sort of tweak to their own needs and criteria and get some similar results.  
**[0:26:54-0:27:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:26:54):**  Now we've talked a lot about what people can do for their own lifestyle changes their consumer  
**[0:27:00-0:27:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:27:00):**  habits and such. But I know that a huge part of living regeneratively and making that kind  
**[0:27:04-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:27:04):**  of transition is your interactions with the community and how you support both the local  
**[0:27:10-0:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:27:10):**  economy the local ecology and the connections in between your own lifestyle and the people  
**[0:27:16-0:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:27:16):**  that you live around. What are some of the tactics and the solutions that you've found  
**[0:27:21-0:27:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:27:21):**  yourself in you know bringing these ethics and these ideas to the rest of your community  
**[0:27:28-0:27:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:27:28):**  and having them benefit more than just yourself. Yeah. Yeah it's another big question. I love  
**[0:27:35-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:27:35):**  these Oliver. Well so my thing is and what we always try  
**[0:27:38-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:27:38):**  and push at least through my company and what I try and promote is a very holistic view  
**[0:27:43-0:27:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:27:43):**  of regenerative lifestyle implementation. And obviously if it's too focused in your  
**[0:27:50-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:27:50):**  own lifestyle in your own interior you kind of start to lose the bigger picture. And one  
**[0:27:55-0:28:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:27:55):**  of the questions that I constantly get is like how much land do you need to produce  
**[0:28:00-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:28:00):**  all your own food or like you know how much would it cost to be entirely self-sufficient.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:28:06):**  And I usually meet that question with the answer of like I don't think that's what you  
**[0:28:11-0:28:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:28:11):**  really want you know because when you cut off the interactions and a certain amount  
**[0:28:16-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:28:16):**  of the reliance on your community you become a hermit basically and you miss out on the  
**[0:28:23-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:28:23):**  efficiencies and the joy of interaction with the larger community and you know your family  
**[0:28:30-0:28:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:28:30):**  your friends the local economy and all of those connections that really make life enriching.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:28:36):**  So I don't know if you've really thought about this and it's fine if we can. I'm more than  
**[0:28:40-0:28:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:28:40):**  happy to skip to another question or something but I'd love to get your insights on it if  
**[0:28:44-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:28:44):**  you could think of something. Yeah hearing that question is interesting  
**[0:28:48-0:28:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:28:48):**  for me because of how integrated so much of this has become because I've been doing it  
**[0:28:51-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:28:51):**  for so long and it's been that a lot of my outreach and work within the community is  
**[0:28:56-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:28:56):**  through living this way and being a model to others. And I kind of keep returning to  
**[0:29:02-0:29:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:29:02):**  that idea because I don't think that everyone can do the same things that I do and to ask  
**[0:29:08-0:29:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:29:08):**  them to is disingenuous in many regards because my life is what it is. There's only one Scott  
**[0:29:15-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:29:15):**  man you know and I have my two young children and a U.S. Marine and all of these other things  
**[0:29:23-0:29:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:29:23):**  that I've gone through to kind of become the person who I am. And so by doing the best  
**[0:29:29-0:29:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:29:29):**  that I can and interacting with others I feel gives the best way for other people to interact  
**[0:29:35-0:29:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:29:35):**  with this. You know when people ask me about what it is that I'm doing to talk about well  
**[0:29:39-0:29:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:29:39):**  you know I'm trying to figure out how do I solve this issue about reducing my use of  
**[0:29:44-0:29:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:29:44):**  like straws and plastics. You know understanding that there's a lot of things that I'm not  
**[0:29:49-0:29:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:29:49):**  going to be able to get away from. But in like my day to day life what can I do and  
**[0:29:53-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:29:53):**  inviting people in to be a part of my problem solving so that then they get engaged and  
**[0:30:00-0:30:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:30:00):**  are kind of drawn into this too and can begin to ask these kinds of questions. And it's  
**[0:30:05-0:30:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:30:05):**  interesting as I do these kinds of things to hear back from people you know it may be  
**[0:30:08-0:30:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:30:08):**  years later that they finally decided to join a CSA and now they're getting their food locally.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:30:13):**  And we might have a conversation about whether or not they want to do a CSA share from a  
**[0:30:19-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:30:19):**  farm that's all organic but they might have to drive twice as far to pick up their share  
**[0:30:23-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:30:23):**  from or do they go to the local century farm that's been there you know for four generations  
**[0:30:29-0:30:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:30:29):**  now but their CSA drop is on their way home from work and kind of helping people to navigate  
**[0:30:35-0:30:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:30:35):**  these things or like some friends who are living in an intentional community spending  
**[0:30:40-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:30:40):**  time with them to talk about what it's like to build up in that kind of space having visited  
**[0:30:45-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:30:45):**  other intentional communities and taking all these things that I care and love so much  
**[0:30:51-0:30:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:30:51):**  and turning it outward looking for ways that my friends and I can spend time together truly  
**[0:30:57-0:31:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:30:57):**  locally within our environment while still engaging in some of the interests that we  
**[0:31:02-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:31:02):**  have like finding the local art house theater which I don't know how I had missed living  
**[0:31:07-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:31:07):**  in central Pennsylvania for so long but getting an invitation to a local film festival that  
**[0:31:12-0:31:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:31:12):**  was being held there and going and supporting local artists in that way. Finding again because  
**[0:31:19-0:31:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:31:19):**  of trying to live within this very small financial footprint these things that I used to love  
**[0:31:25-0:31:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:31:25):**  so much individually and then inviting other people who I know who have these interests  
**[0:31:30-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:31:30):**  along and being able to deepen our relationships through these activities again within our  
**[0:31:35-0:31:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:31:35):**  local environment and that I know that's kind of really relationship based and it's not  
**[0:31:41-0:31:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:31:41):**  necessarily hard numbers but I find that it's that relational engagement that allows us  
**[0:31:47-0:31:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:31:47):**  to have a bigger handprint as these ideas as I was kind of saying earlier we kind of  
**[0:31:53-0:31:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:31:53):**  ripple out through those people who are around us and as we show them that they can live  
**[0:31:59-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:31:59):**  a joyous and bountiful life by stepping away from some of these things that it's not really  
**[0:32:05-0:32:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:32:05):**  a place of misery that they can renounce and enjoy everything that it is that they're doing  
**[0:32:10-0:32:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:32:10):**  and they've ever loved it just takes a little bit of creativity to do so and that by doing  
**[0:32:15-0:32:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:32:15):**  that in a non-judgmental way and celebrating the choices and decisions that people make  
**[0:32:21-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:32:21):**  along the way really gets people engaged. You know as we become cheerleaders for their  
**[0:32:25-0:32:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:32:25):**  life decisions that you know maybe they decided to downsize from an SUV to a minivan that gets  
**[0:32:33-0:32:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:32:33):**  them two or three more miles per gallon when they're commuting yet still allows them to  
**[0:32:37-0:32:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:32:37):**  carry their family comfortably and you know can we celebrate those choices or maybe they  
**[0:32:41-0:32:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:32:41):**  were somebody who always like to get a new car every three years and they decided that  
**[0:32:46-0:32:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:32:46):**  maybe that's still a pattern that they like but rather than getting something new they  
**[0:32:50-0:32:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:32:50):**  want to get something new to them and all of these changes that we make as individuals  
**[0:32:56-0:33:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:32:56):**  really do have an impact on everybody else around us and yeah I just I love celebrating  
**[0:33:06-0:33:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:33:06):**  and helping other people express their passion in the world and that yeah doing those kinds  
**[0:33:12-0:33:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:33:12):**  of things gets people really engaged and they take ownership for these choices.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:33:17):**  I really love that you mentioned that because you know in the different educational platforms  
**[0:33:23-0:33:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:33:23):**  and places that I visited while learning both natural building and permaculture you know  
**[0:33:28-0:33:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:33:28):**  I've met some absolutely fantastic people but I've also met quite a few individuals  
**[0:33:32-0:33:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:33:32):**  who are very zealotous about this being kind of an all or nothing investment in your life  
**[0:33:39-0:33:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:33:39):**  where like you should be getting rid of unnecessary technology I've even been to sites where people  
**[0:33:44-0:33:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:33:44):**  ask you to leave your cell phones in your car before they get on to their farm worrying  
**[0:33:50-0:33:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:33:50):**  about you know the radiation and you know whether those things are valid or important  
**[0:33:53-0:34:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:33:53):**  or not it does tend to ostracize people who are not yet ready to go all the way in and  
**[0:34:01-0:34:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:34:01):**  abandon the comforts that they're used to the conveniences that have made their life  
**[0:34:05-0:34:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:34:05):**  easy but still want to make steps in the right direction and I love that you said you know  
**[0:34:09-0:34:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:34:09):**  all of these however small choices and progressions are all moving in the right direction and  
**[0:34:16-0:34:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:34:16):**  deserve to be celebrated. I think that's a really great way to avoid getting burned out  
**[0:34:21-0:34:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:34:21):**  with the stresses and the anxiety that a lot of these environmental and geopolitical concepts  
**[0:34:27-0:34:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:34:27):**  tend to weigh on our day to day lives. And if you don't take the time to celebrate the  
**[0:34:32-0:34:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:34:32):**  even small bits of progress that you make it's very easy to become burned out and somewhat  
**[0:34:38-0:34:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:34:38):**  apathetic. So I really appreciate you bringing that up. And it's one of the things like as  
**[0:34:44-0:34:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:34:44):**  I've worked through this I've been to some sites that are like that and I can appreciate  
**[0:34:48-0:34:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:34:48):**  what people are doing who ask us not to have technology around us. But like I said earlier  
**[0:34:53-0:34:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:34:53):**  it's still this transitional period and for those of us who are trying to be communicators  
**[0:34:57-0:35:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:34:57):**  and educators and be engaged you know if we're being invited somewhere that we've never been  
**[0:35:02-0:35:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:35:02):**  to before you know something printing out your directions before you go something as  
**[0:35:06-0:35:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:35:06):**  simple as a single road closure can keep you from getting there and having a high impact.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:35:11):**  And so there are these kinds of things where we just live in a particular society that  
**[0:35:16-0:35:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:35:16):**  requires certain choices. And it was one of the things my parenting partner and I when  
**[0:35:21-0:35:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:35:21):**  our when our shared children were born we were making decisions about how we were going  
**[0:35:25-0:35:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:35:25):**  to raise them. And it was OK well we're going to limit screen time. How much are we going  
**[0:35:30-0:35:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:35:30):**  to limit that and how are we going to feed them. Is it OK for our children to have fast  
**[0:35:36-0:35:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:35:36):**  food. Is it OK for us to take our children to amusement parks. And it was this long list  
**[0:35:40-0:35:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:35:40):**  of values that we stepped through in order to decide just how to raise our children.  
**[0:35:46-0:35:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:35:46):**  And in doing so we did decide that OK our children are going to eat fast food from time  
**[0:35:51-0:35:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:35:51):**  to time because that's a shared social point that so many of their fellow students have  
**[0:35:58-0:36:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:35:58):**  in their classroom. And so if that's the place where those children can connect because it's  
**[0:36:05-0:36:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:36:05):**  you know what was the last toy that you got you know in your takeout meal or something  
**[0:36:10-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:36:10):**  like that. But then that allows them to become friends and then my daughter is talking to  
**[0:36:15-0:36:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:36:15):**  one of her friends about us going and picking violets or my son talking about how we were  
**[0:36:19-0:36:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:36:19):**  foraging for raspberries because it's a conversation about food. That's more important to me in  
**[0:36:26-0:36:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:36:26):**  the long run than getting super hyper focused on making like the perfect decision all the  
**[0:36:34-0:36:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:36:34):**  time because that decision is really only my decision and doesn't necessarily help other  
**[0:36:40-0:36:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:36:40):**  people get to the point where they can integrate these ideas. And that's why I like these small  
**[0:36:44-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:36:44):**  and slow solutions to borrow one of the principles of permaculture is because if you can help  
**[0:36:49-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:36:49):**  somebody make that transition from like I say the SUV to the minivan well then over  
**[0:36:54-0:36:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:36:54):**  time they may start thinking then about the next time that it's not going to be a minivan  
**[0:36:58-0:37:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:36:58):**  maybe that's where they get you know one of the hybrid wagons that now doubles their fuel  
**[0:37:03-0:37:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:37:03):**  economy or even decides to live near a school so their children can walk. And it's you know  
**[0:37:09-0:37:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:37:09):**  as we get people to start thinking about these little things it opens up their thoughts to  
**[0:37:14-0:37:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:37:14):**  these really big issues that are going on that they can have a real impact for. And  
**[0:37:20-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:37:20):**  I just yeah I see so many people get shut out or shut down because they don't feel like  
**[0:37:25-0:37:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:37:25):**  they're good enough. And if we get to the point where other people don't feel like they  
**[0:37:30-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:37:30):**  can be empowered to be a part of this then they're never going to feel invited in. And  
**[0:37:37-0:37:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:37:37):**  I find that a lot of what happens within the hyper competitive marketplace that we're in  
**[0:37:44-0:37:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:37:44):**  as employees as business owners with this idea of everything needing to be just in time  
**[0:37:50-0:37:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:37:50):**  and delivered right when it has to happen that it shuts a lot of people out that we  
**[0:37:56-0:38:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:37:56):**  no longer feel like we can ask to step into a space and instead feel more and more like  
**[0:38:02-0:38:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:38:02):**  we have to be invited in. And I feel that those of us who are making these choices now  
**[0:38:08-0:38:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:38:08):**  need to be inviting more people into our circles even if there's somebody who shows up you  
**[0:38:13-0:38:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:38:13):**  know to our all organic potluck with a two liter bottle of Diet Coke which we ourselves  
**[0:38:18-0:38:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:38:18):**  may not drink that we should celebrate their presence there not that they brought something  
**[0:38:24-0:38:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:38:24):**  in that we might not agree with and that as we do more and more of this we can be like  
**[0:38:28-0:38:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:38:28):**  I say talking and engaging and getting more of those folks who are on the fence or looking  
**[0:38:32-0:38:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:38:32):**  over it involved. Yeah I really love that perspective and the  
**[0:38:38-0:38:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:38:38):**  emphasis on strengthening those connections I think is something that often gets lost  
**[0:38:43-0:38:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:38:43):**  sight of as people get entrenched in their particular dietary habits or their particular  
**[0:38:48-0:38:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:38:48):**  consumer habits and can end up ostracizing people who could potentially be incredible  
**[0:38:55-0:39:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:38:55):**  allies in this move towards a regenerative future. But you know if those connections  
**[0:39:01-0:39:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:39:01):**  are lost you're losing so much more than just you know an argument about what is ethically  
**[0:39:07-0:39:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:39:07):**  correct but you're losing a ton of potential to enforce and grow your community. So I love  
**[0:39:15-0:39:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:39:15):**  you echoing that. Now let's switch gears for just a second because I'd love to talk about  
**[0:39:20-0:39:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:39:20):**  some of the insights that you've gained over now seven years of running this podcast. You've  
**[0:39:26-0:39:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:39:26):**  spoken with some of the leaders and the innovators in the regenerative fields and I would love  
**[0:39:32-0:39:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:39:32):**  to just get your perspective on what have been some of the insights and the innovations  
**[0:39:39-0:39:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:39:39):**  that have inspired you most in maybe the last one or two years and have given you hope and  
**[0:39:44-0:39:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:39:44):**  excitement for where this is going and how it's growing.  
**[0:39:48-0:39:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:39:48):**  What I'm really excited and happy about with where all of this is headed towards I think  
**[0:39:53-0:40:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:39:53):**  really begins with Toby Hemingway's The Permaculture City and my conversation with him before he  
**[0:40:01-0:40:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:40:01):**  passed. So this would probably be about two and a half years ago three years ago that  
**[0:40:05-0:40:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:40:05):**  I had that conversation with him that kind of started me in the direction where I've  
**[0:40:08-0:40:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:40:08):**  been headed. And it was interesting for me talking with Toby both in the interview and  
**[0:40:12-0:40:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:40:12):**  the emails that we exchanged setting it up and then afterwards and also the content of  
**[0:40:17-0:40:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:40:17):**  his book because he was really like the first permaculture leader who I felt put something  
**[0:40:22-0:40:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:40:22):**  out there that said that we don't have to go back to the land. We don't have to be growing  
**[0:40:27-0:40:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:40:27):**  all of our own food. We don't need to be pushing ourselves further and further into these places  
**[0:40:35-0:40:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:40:35):**  that are actually requiring more and more resources to support us that if we're down  
**[0:40:40-0:40:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:40:40):**  at the end of that country lane way far away we might not have a cell phone or anything  
**[0:40:44-0:40:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:40:44):**  else. But what about all that copper and those lines that get to our house. What about all  
**[0:40:48-0:40:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:40:48):**  the gravel that's being spread across that lane every year as it gets rutted from rain  
**[0:40:53-0:41:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:40:53):**  and snow and erosion versus somebody who's living compactly in a city and isn't raising  
**[0:41:00-0:41:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:41:00):**  their own food but instead is trying to make the best ethical choices they can in that  
**[0:41:04-0:41:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:41:04):**  space because now they're living in a smaller space that requires less energy to support.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:41:09):**  And it's been through those kinds of things that made me step back even further away from  
**[0:41:14-0:41:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:41:14):**  some of the land based practices that have been very common to permaculture conversations  
**[0:41:20-0:41:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:41:20):**  and the regenerative field for a long time and to begin looking at the decisions that  
**[0:41:26-0:41:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:41:26):**  we can make for where we are right now whether that is in a rural setting a peri urban setting  
**[0:41:33-0:41:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:41:33):**  an urban setting wherever we find ourselves is where these decisions need to be made.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:41:38):**  And that as we start doing those things and making the decisions that are best for us  
**[0:41:42-0:41:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:41:42):**  in this space the other piece that emerges from David Holmgren and from Ethan Hughes  
**[0:41:48-0:41:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:41:48):**  and you know to mention carnals and Ramanujan again and some others is that the work that  
**[0:41:54-0:41:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:41:54):**  we're doing ultimately is with the people who are in front of us that if we're going  
**[0:41:59-0:42:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:41:59):**  to really create a regenerative world that is as inclusive as we can make it that we  
**[0:42:08-0:42:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:42:08):**  have to be doing this right here right now every day in the moment.  
**[0:42:13-0:42:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:42:13):**  And so when we're with our family or with our friends that if a question arises being  
**[0:42:22-0:42:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:42:22):**  able to take the time to answer it that if somebody we know is having a difficult time  
**[0:42:28-0:42:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:42:28):**  that we make ourselves available to them that we're present as much as possible.  
**[0:42:35-0:42:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:42:35):**  And it was I don't remember who raised this idea to me but that it's you know as much  
**[0:42:40-0:42:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:42:40):**  as we may want to go to the next festival the next convergence these big events they're  
**[0:42:45-0:42:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:42:45):**  really inspiring and can feed a lot of passion for us as we get to be around other people  
**[0:42:51-0:42:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:42:51):**  in their passion and also share our own that those things are great and it's good that  
**[0:42:57-0:43:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:42:57):**  we're doing it and that we're planning for them and we're attending them so that we can  
**[0:43:00-0:43:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:43:00):**  continue to network and have that face to face time but that those large events and  
**[0:43:08-0:43:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:43:08):**  things where we're face to face to others that we need to also like I say pull that  
**[0:43:12-0:43:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:43:12):**  back and spend more face to face time with those people who are interested in these ideas  
**[0:43:15-0:43:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:43:15):**  who are already in our community to go to our township meetings when they're going to  
**[0:43:22-0:43:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:43:22):**  be making a decision about something to let our voices be known and to show that we're  
**[0:43:26-0:43:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:43:26):**  active and interested in these things and then you know as we're in that space with  
**[0:43:32-0:43:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:43:32):**  friends and family to help them work through the choices that they're making to deepen  
**[0:43:37-0:43:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:43:37):**  those relationships to strengthen our community one on one face to face and in ever larger  
**[0:43:43-0:43:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:43:43):**  groups. Marvelous. Yeah I'm really glad that you  
**[0:43:47-0:43:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:43:47):**  brought up that book Permaculture City by Tomi Hemingway. That's been one of the most  
**[0:43:51-0:43:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:43:51):**  inspiring volumes that I've read in the last couple of years and like you touched on the  
**[0:43:56-0:44:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:43:56):**  real takeaway that I got from that is that it flips on its head this idea that the only  
**[0:44:01-0:44:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:44:01):**  way of making regenerative lifestyle choices is to move back to the land and start producing  
**[0:44:07-0:44:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:44:07):**  as much of your own things as possible. Certainly there's a lot of merit to that but like you  
**[0:44:12-0:44:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:44:12):**  said you know the amount of resources consumed when you're that far removed are so much larger  
**[0:44:18-0:44:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:44:18):**  than when you live in a more close knit community which isn't at all to say that our cities  
**[0:44:23-0:44:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:44:23):**  are models of you know progress and sustainability or regeneration. But it also doesn't mean  
**[0:44:30-0:44:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:44:30):**  that you need to abandon your lifestyle because certainly there are advantages to you know  
**[0:44:35-0:44:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:44:35):**  the economic opportunities the conveniences that you know towns and especially cities  
**[0:44:41-0:44:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:44:41):**  can present and that you can start to make positive changes and have an impact in those  
**[0:44:47-0:44:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:44:47):**  places without you know sort of throwing the baby out with the bathwater so to speak. And  
**[0:44:52-0:44:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:44:52):**  I really hope that's one of the largest takeaways that anybody gets either from this podcast  
**[0:44:56-0:45:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:44:56):**  from the courses that we do from listening to your own resources is that there's really  
**[0:45:01-0:45:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:45:01):**  no reason why you would have to wait to start moving and living within the ethics that you  
**[0:45:08-0:45:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:45:08):**  hold dear and that a major you know like single stop lifestyle shift is what is required.  
**[0:45:16-0:45:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:45:16):**  You know all those small decisions like we were talking about earlier every day is an  
**[0:45:20-0:45:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:45:20):**  opportunity for making a small shift in the right direction. And I think a lot of people  
**[0:45:25-0:45:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:45:25):**  find that empowering especially after you know maybe interacting with some of the more  
**[0:45:30-0:45:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:45:30):**  extreme communities that promote this abandonment of modern society and infrastructure.  
**[0:45:39-0:45:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:45:39):**  And it's a friend of mine who has pulled themselves away from society a great deal. Many of our  
**[0:45:46-0:45:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:45:46):**  conversations for a long time felt as if he was encouraging everyone to do that. And then  
**[0:45:53-0:45:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:45:53):**  it was only probably two or three years into talking about many of these ideas that he  
**[0:45:58-0:46:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:45:58):**  became very clear with me that we can't do that. There is no real way for us to escape  
**[0:46:04-0:46:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:46:04):**  society as much as we might want to pull away or you know go back to the land and feel as  
**[0:46:10-0:46:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:46:10):**  if we are away from all of these things and becoming like as you were mentioning earlier  
**[0:46:14-0:46:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:46:14):**  kind of insular or like a hermit that it may feel like we're doing that but because of  
**[0:46:20-0:46:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:46:20):**  the world that we live in today it's not really possible. I mean even many of the back to  
**[0:46:26-0:46:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:46:26):**  the land movements that have occurred over the years whether we're looking at the Anabaptists  
**[0:46:30-0:46:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:46:30):**  and the Amish or some of the more modern eco villages none of them that I'm aware of are  
**[0:46:36-0:46:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:46:36):**  completely disconnected from the resources of our larger nation state and the global  
**[0:46:43-0:46:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:46:43):**  society. And so being aware of that I think allows us to make better decisions as we move  
**[0:46:50-0:46:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:46:50):**  forward because we are connected to all of these things. So how can we take the best  
**[0:46:55-0:47:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:46:55):**  advantage of all of those connections and all the resources that are available to us  
**[0:47:00-0:47:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:47:00):**  as we continue to move towards a more regenerative lifestyle and a model for others.  
**[0:47:06-0:47:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:47:06):**  Yeah I completely agree. Now Scott before I let you go today could you tell us more  
**[0:47:11-0:47:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:47:11):**  about how people can get in touch with you. Find your podcast and any other resources  
**[0:47:16-0:47:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:47:16):**  that you would like to promote here. Sure. One resource that I want to mention  
**[0:47:21-0:47:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:47:21):**  in regards to where permaculture and regenerative living is really going is I want to plug David  
**[0:47:28-0:47:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:47:28):**  Holmgren's retro suburbia which was just recently released and is available through permaculture  
**[0:47:33-0:47:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:47:33):**  principles dot com. I really think that anybody who is in this urban or suburban space and  
**[0:47:38-0:47:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:47:38):**  wants to live regeneratively should pick up a copy of that. I think it's like seventy  
**[0:47:41-0:47:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:47:41):**  dollars in the United States but it's like six hundred pages of everything you can do  
**[0:47:46-0:47:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:47:46):**  where you are right now in the city in the suburbs to make a really big difference. And  
**[0:47:53-0:47:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:47:53):**  the other kind of final thought on that is that where each of us are each day that we  
**[0:47:59-0:48:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:47:59):**  can live regeneratively and that we should be applying these ideas exactly to where we  
**[0:48:03-0:48:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:48:03):**  are and what we do. Not everybody needs to be going off into the world and being a teacher  
**[0:48:07-0:48:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:48:07):**  or a designer or a gardener or a farmer whether you're an accountant or a lawyer or a doctor  
**[0:48:13-0:48:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:48:13):**  a janitor a stay at home parent. All of these things that we've talked about today everything  
**[0:48:17-0:48:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:48:17):**  that you'll hear on your show Oliver on my show. These are all things that you can apply  
**[0:48:24-0:48:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:48:24):**  where you are and just do that and enjoy it. When it comes to my show if people want to  
**[0:48:31-0:48:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:48:31):**  visit and dig into the archives I've got over four hundred and fifty interviews now with  
**[0:48:37-0:48:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:48:37):**  everybody in the permaculture and regenerative community that you might be able to think  
**[0:48:40-0:48:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:48:40):**  of if you have their book on your shelf. They probably appeared on my show at one point  
**[0:48:45-0:48:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:48:45):**  and that's at the permaculture podcast dot com. If folks want to get in touch I always  
**[0:48:51-0:48:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:48:51):**  like to throw this stuff out there. My email address is show at the permaculture podcast  
**[0:48:55-0:48:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:48:55):**  dot com if you want to shoot me an email you have any questions about anything that I've  
**[0:48:58-0:49:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:48:58):**  said today and I always make myself directly available if you want to give me a call. That  
**[0:49:02-0:49:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:49:02):**  phone number is 7 1 7 8 2 7 6 2 6 6. Excellent. Thank you so much for taking the  
**[0:49:11-0:49:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:49:11):**  time and let me just take a moment to say thank you for all of the resources that you've  
**[0:49:15-0:49:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:49:15):**  put out there so consistently over the years. Your podcast has been such a major inspiration  
**[0:49:20-0:49:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:49:20):**  for this show that I'm doing now. And yeah thank you again for taking the time today.  
**[0:49:25-0:49:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:49:25):**  I really hope we can stay in touch and continue to work together and promote these amazing  
**[0:49:33-0:49:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-scott-mann/#t=0:49:33):**  ideas and the incredible work that so many inspiring individuals are doing out there.

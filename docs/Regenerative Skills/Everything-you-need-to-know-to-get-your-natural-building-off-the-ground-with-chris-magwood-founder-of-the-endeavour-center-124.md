**[0:03:28-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:03:28):**  In this interview, Chris talks about how he fell in love with natural building as he aspired  
**[0:03:32-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:03:32):**  to build his own home.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:03:34):**  From there we go into detail about some of the most important considerations when designing  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:03:38):**  a sustainable home and how even natural buildings can be consumptive and wasteful if designed  
**[0:03:43-0:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:03:43):**  incorrectly for their place and climate.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:03:46):**  Chris also unpacks some of the popular building standards and why using them as design guides  
**[0:03:51-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:03:51):**  can limit the full potential of an ecologically responsible project if followed too rigidly.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:03:57):**  We also discuss one of the biggest challenges for natural builders, and that's the codes  
**[0:04:02-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:04:02):**  and regulations that can be tricky to navigate if the regulatory bodies are treated as adversaries  
**[0:04:07-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:04:07):**  from the beginning.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:04:09):**  I especially like his observations from his extensive experience working with rather than  
**[0:04:13-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:04:13):**  against the building inspectors in Canada for so many years.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:04:17):**  This is a really practical and pragmatic look at the wide variety of options and considerations  
**[0:04:22-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:04:22):**  for natural builders and owner builders.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:04:25):**  This episode kicks off a series dedicated to all aspects of building and design that  
**[0:04:29-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:04:29):**  facilitates a regenerative lifestyle.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:04:32):**  Be sure to stay tuned in the next few weeks of episodes as I'll be speaking with builders  
**[0:04:36-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:04:36):**  and designers focusing on in-depth topics and natural building materials.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:04:41):**  With that preface out of the way, I'll turn things over to Chris.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:04:44):**  Hey, Chris, how are you doing today?  
**[0:04:48-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:04:48):**  I'm great, thanks.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:04:49):**  Good to be talking to you.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:04:50):**  Thanks so much for being here.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:04:51):**  Yeah, it's such a pleasure to finally talk to you.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:04:53):**  I've been a big fan of your books and have been following your work for quite some time.  
**[0:04:57-0:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:04:57):**  It's a real pleasure to finally speak to you.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:04:59):**  Now I've got a ton of questions that I'd love to ask kind of circulating around everything  
**[0:05:04-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:05:04):**  you've researched and done with natural buildings.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:05:06):**  So what do you say we just jump right in?  
**[0:05:08-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:05:08):**  That sounds great.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:05:09):**  All right.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:05:10):**  So let's give our listeners a little bit of background information.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:05:15):**  Tell me how you got interested in natural building and what the project was that first  
**[0:05:20-0:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:05:20):**  sparked your passion.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:05:22):**  Sure, yeah.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:05:23):**  The first project was actually a home for myself and my family.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:05:28):**  Back in the late 90s, we ended up building the first permitted straw bale house in Ontario.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:05:36):**  And I didn't really have any building experience going into that.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:05:39):**  So it was a very steep learning curve, but something that I really enjoyed.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:05:45):**  The house was also off grid.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:05:47):**  So I built a lot of our own energy systems and water systems and things like that.  
**[0:05:54-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:05:54):**  And so I had a pretty good crash course in natural building and sort of sustainable living  
**[0:06:02-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:06:02):**  and wasn't intending on making it a career.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:06:06):**  But because it was an early example of something like that going on, people would find out  
**[0:06:12-0:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:06:12):**  about what we'd done and come visit.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:06:14):**  And those visits led to requests to come and teach a workshop.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:06:19):**  And then at the workshop led to somebody who wanted us to build a house.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:06:23):**  And within a couple of years, the natural building side of things became my full time  
**[0:06:30-0:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:06:30):**  occupation.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:06:32):**  And that's what I've been doing basically ever since.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:06:35):**  So you didn't set out at all with the idea of becoming a contractor or a natural building  
**[0:06:39-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:06:39):**  educator?  
**[0:06:40-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:06:40):**  No, not at all.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:06:41):**  I just wanted a good house with a light environmental footprint and no mortgage.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:06:48):**  And that's how that started.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:06:50):**  But I guess a lot of other people did too.  
**[0:06:54-0:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:06:54):**  And once there was an actual example of something like that, that people could come and see  
**[0:07:00-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:07:00):**  and experience, the sort of invitations kind of followed from that.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:07:05):**  And having done my own house first, inevitably, you make a lot of mistakes.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:07:12):**  I think I made every mistake it's possible to make in doing something like that.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:07:17):**  But at each point, I guess I have one of those brains that as I'm doing something, I'm always  
**[0:07:22-0:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:07:22):**  thinking about how it could be done better next time.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:07:25):**  And so when people started offering invitations for there to be next times, I was really sort  
**[0:07:32-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:07:32):**  of keen to try to put some of those insights to work.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:07:37):**  And so, yeah, I've been building and designing ever since.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:07:43):**  I love that.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:07:44):**  It's very similar to my own motivations for getting into this, wanting to build my own  
**[0:07:48-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:07:48):**  house, have a low ecological footprint, and attempt something that without a ton of experience  
**[0:07:55-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:07:55):**  or formal education, one could get started with.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:07:58):**  And I think a lot of other people can relate to that in natural building as well.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:08:02):**  But you've taken it a lot further.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:08:04):**  And I've known you to call yourself a building omnivore.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:08:08):**  Tell me about the inspiration to explore natural and vernacular building techniques from all  
**[0:08:14-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:08:14):**  around the world and in a lot of different contexts.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:08:17):**  Yeah, I think it's because, you know, my start and the decision to build a straw bale house  
**[0:08:25-0:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:08:25):**  in the first place kind of came from my partner and I doing a lot of research into various  
**[0:08:32-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:08:32):**  methods that were being kind of touted as being ecologically friendly at the time.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:08:40):**  And sort of seeing that if we looked at a whole bunch of these things, nothing was the  
**[0:08:46-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:08:46):**  silver bullet.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:08:49):**  People would really talk a lot about the positives.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:08:52):**  But if you did a little scratching, you'd also find, oh, there's this whole other side  
**[0:08:55-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:08:55):**  of drawbacks to all of these things.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:08:58):**  And so right from the get go, I think I was really aware that nothing was perfect and  
**[0:09:06-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:09:06):**  that context mattered a lot.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:09:08):**  So we ended up choosing a straw bale house for a whole bunch of reasons that were specific  
**[0:09:12-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:09:12):**  to our context.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:09:14):**  But I never sort of got started with the notion that one material was the answer to every  
**[0:09:25-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:09:25):**  building's question.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:09:29):**  And also, as we developed that house, I started using solar energy, wind energy, micro hydro,  
**[0:09:37-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:09:37):**  solar hot water and various versions of those things and realized that, again, there isn't  
**[0:09:43-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:09:43):**  sort of a one answer solution that's going to work in all scenarios for all cases.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:09:50):**  And so, yeah, I sort of always had an appetite for trying to figure out what will work in  
**[0:09:57-0:10:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:09:57):**  this particular context, in this location, for this client at this time.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:10:03):**  And so that sort of led to that kind of omnivorous appetite for learning about all kinds of different  
**[0:10:11-0:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:10:11):**  materials and techniques and systems.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:10:14):**  And so since you've had such a broad overlook of a wide variety of materials and techniques,  
**[0:10:20-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:10:20):**  I know you wrote and sort of laid it out very well in one of my favorite books on this,  
**[0:10:26-0:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:10:26):**  The Making Better Buildings book that you released with New Society.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:10:30):**  Can you give me some of the insights that you've gotten from comparing all of these  
**[0:10:35-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:10:35):**  common natural building techniques and how they stack up to one another?  
**[0:10:40-0:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:10:40):**  Yeah, I think, you know, that that book came out of working with so many clients and people  
**[0:10:48-0:10:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:10:48):**  kind of come to me because, you know, they they know there's this sort of background  
**[0:10:54-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:10:54):**  and experience with sustainable building.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:10:57):**  And what we realized as we started, you know, our design team here was working with a lot  
**[0:11:02-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:11:02):**  of different clients is that everybody had a very different notion of what they meant  
**[0:11:07-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:11:07):**  by a sustainable building.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:11:09):**  And we started to see a pattern in the things that mattered to people.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:11:13):**  And we realized that that what people were interested in really directed our designs  
**[0:11:20-0:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:11:20):**  a lot.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:11:21):**  So, you know, somebody might be thinking about a sustainable building as being something  
**[0:11:25-0:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:11:25):**  that's, say, really healthy for them, you know, really clean indoor environment, really  
**[0:11:31-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:11:31):**  good air quality, really good water quality, really good light quality.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:11:35):**  And to them, that's a sustainable building.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:11:37):**  And for somebody else, it might be the carbon footprint of the building.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:11:41):**  And for somebody else, it might be the energy efficiency.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:11:42):**  And for somebody else, it might be being mortgage free and being very low cost.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:11:46):**  So you know, we realized that that of all the materials and systems that are out there,  
**[0:11:52-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:11:52):**  they all kind of stack up differently according to all those different criteria.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:11:57):**  So that book is kind of based around us looking at the kind of like what we saw as the 10  
**[0:12:04-0:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:12:04):**  criteria that people were kind of coming to us with and rating the materials, not so much  
**[0:12:10-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:12:10):**  to compare them to each other, but to compare them to those criteria to help people kind  
**[0:12:14-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:12:14):**  of get directed towards the materials and the systems that really suit them.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:12:21):**  So our whole approach at Endeavor is to really be goal focused with our clients, you know,  
**[0:12:29-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:12:29):**  to try to help them really understand what is it that you actually mean when you say  
**[0:12:35-0:12:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:12:35):**  a sustainable building and what is it that you actually sort of like, want this building  
**[0:12:39-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:12:39):**  to do for you and sort of let that direct the selection, rather than somebody just saying,  
**[0:12:47-0:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:12:47):**  I want a straw bale house, you know, which is a very common reaction or I want an earthship  
**[0:12:51-0:12:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:12:51):**  or I want solar energy, you know, people tend to fixate on a particular material or system.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:12:59):**  But, and sometimes that's the right choice, but sometimes it's just, it's the right notion,  
**[0:13:06-0:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:13:06):**  but it's not necessarily the right choice when you start digging.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:13:09):**  So as a designer, I'm sort of a bit like the annoying three year old child.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:13:17):**  If somebody says, I want a straw bale house, I want to say to them, why?  
**[0:13:21-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:13:21):**  You know, what's the motivation for that?  
**[0:13:25-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:13:25):**  And so maybe a straw bale house is the right thing to answer that question, why?  
**[0:13:29-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:13:29):**  But sometimes it's, sometimes that's not.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:13:34):**  And so, yeah, very interested in sort of that, the criteria of what makes a building sustainable  
**[0:13:43-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:13:43):**  for a particular person.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:13:44):**  Yeah, I'm so glad that you brought that insight up.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:13:47):**  That's one of the main things that I've struggled to communicate and sort of wade through when  
**[0:13:51-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:13:51):**  getting clients initially myself.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:13:54):**  Like you said, a lot of people come, especially with different ideas based on, you know, fads  
**[0:13:59-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:13:59):**  or books or Facebook posts or whatever that motivated them towards a particular material  
**[0:14:05-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:14:05):**  or a building style.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:14:07):**  And when you start to ask those questions, you understand that the motivation may or  
**[0:14:14-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:14:14):**  may not be linked with what they think it correlates with.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:14:17):**  And you may be able to help them find a better solution for their place, their context, their  
**[0:14:22-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:14:22):**  culture, whatever it is their most important criteria are.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:14:25):**  And so my question would be, what are some of the most common criteria?  
**[0:14:29-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:14:29):**  I know you break down 10 in that book, but what are the most common ones or the most  
**[0:14:34-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:14:34):**  popular ones that you mostly hear from, let's say, course participants and clients?  
**[0:14:40-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:14:40):**  I think, you know, what's interesting is that it ends up being very individual, but I definitely  
**[0:14:46-0:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:14:46):**  think that those earlier ones I mentioned, indoor environment quality, sort of overall  
**[0:14:52-0:15:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:14:52):**  ecological impacts, you know, what impact the building and the material has on ecosystems,  
**[0:15:00-0:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:15:00):**  energy efficiency, cost and sort of coming more and more up, more and more these days  
**[0:15:07-0:15:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:15:07):**  is the carbon footprint part as people start realizing what an impact buildings do have  
**[0:15:14-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:15:14):**  on climate change.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:15:17):**  People are really sort of getting motivated to try to, you know, make sure that any project  
**[0:15:23-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:15:23):**  that they're doing has less climate impact.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:15:27):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:15:28):**  Now in my experience, my personal definitions and priorities that I would choose for myself  
**[0:15:36-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:15:36):**  with having a little more experience, and certainly you've got a lot more than I do,  
**[0:15:40-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:15:40):**  but I'm always looking for, often between, yeah, what I see as effective or appropriate  
**[0:15:47-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:15:47):**  for certain contexts based on or in contrast to what the clients say.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:15:52):**  So what are some of your, let's say, priority criteria that if you were building again for  
**[0:15:58-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:15:58):**  yourself, you would prioritize above others?  
**[0:16:03-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:16:03):**  I have been extremely focused on climate change recently and so that's definitely a big motivator  
**[0:16:12-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:16:12):**  for me.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:16:13):**  And one of the things that I've realized as I've been researching more into the climate  
**[0:16:18-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:16:18):**  impact of buildings is that without intentionally setting out to do the right thing for the  
**[0:16:23-0:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:16:23):**  climate from the get go, the kinds of buildings that we've been doing, because so many natural  
**[0:16:28-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:16:28):**  building materials are plant-based, we've actually been building buildings that have  
**[0:16:35-0:16:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:16:35):**  a sort of net atmospheric carbon drawdown impact rather than actually having an emissions  
**[0:16:41-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:16:41):**  impact.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:16:43):**  So the fact that, you know, it's relatively easy to make a building that is a kind of  
**[0:16:49-0:16:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:16:49):**  climate change solution by storing more carbon in the materials than was emitted in making  
**[0:16:54-0:17:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:16:54):**  them, that to me is really exciting because it's hard to find relatively straightforward,  
**[0:17:02-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:17:02):**  easy climate solutions in the fields of transportation and energy and all those sorts of things.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:17:13):**  The solutions are sort of a lot harder to come by, but it's actually relatively easy  
**[0:17:18-0:17:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:17:18):**  to make a building that has a positive impact on the climate rather than the negative ones.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:17:23):**  So that would kind of underlie any building decisions I made for myself for sure.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:17:32):**  And so within that, like what have been some of the biggest steps or changes in the process  
**[0:17:38-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:17:38):**  that you advocate for in your buildings or teach through your courses that differ from  
**[0:17:43-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:17:43):**  the more conventional or industrial model of building that shift things toward a carbon  
**[0:17:49-0:17:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:17:49):**  neutral or carbon drawback structure?  
**[0:17:53-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:17:53):**  Well essentially it's incorporating as much plant material as it's appropriate to incorporate.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:18:01):**  That's how you get that sort of carbon positive profile.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:18:05):**  In contrast to synthetic materials?  
**[0:18:08-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:18:08):**  That's right.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:18:09):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:18:10):**  So if you think about say wall insulation, the amount of energy it takes to produce say  
**[0:18:17-0:18:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:18:17):**  a straw bale is really, really small and that same straw bale actually is storing a really  
**[0:18:26-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:18:26):**  significant amount of carbon.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:18:28):**  And so the net balance between what it took to make the straw bale and how much carbon  
**[0:18:34-0:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:18:34):**  is in it, it's a net positive.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:18:36):**  I'm going to store more carbon in my building than was emitted in making the material.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:18:40):**  If I use something like fiberglass or rock wool or much worse any of the plastic foam  
**[0:18:47-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:18:47):**  insulations, those have a huge carbon footprint in making them.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:18:51):**  So you know with the mineral based ones, you're basically either melting glass or melting  
**[0:18:56-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:18:56):**  rock.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:18:57):**  So you've used a huge amount of energy and created a lot of emissions to make that material.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:19:05):**  And then yeah, if you can focus on the plant based materials and get away from those more  
**[0:19:14-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:19:14):**  synthetic ones, that has a big impact.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:19:17):**  And there are some insulation types that are not quite from the natural building world.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:19:23):**  Things like cellulose insulation, which is ground up recycled newsprint, which also stores  
**[0:19:29-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:19:29):**  a relatively high amount of carbon and wood fiberboard exterior insulation, which is a  
**[0:19:36-0:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:19:36):**  more sort of manufactured product.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:19:38):**  So there are, you know, there's a range of options available that all end up being carbon  
**[0:19:44-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:19:44):**  storing.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:19:45):**  Some are, you know, would be considered quite alternative and some are relatively mainstream.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:19:52):**  And the other thing that I've found really interesting is, you know, as I'm starting  
**[0:19:55-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:19:55):**  to kind of catalog these materials based on their carbon footprint, what's been really  
**[0:20:02-0:20:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:20:02):**  interesting is to note that when I choose the materials that have the lowest carbon  
**[0:20:07-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:20:07):**  impact, I'm pretty much always choosing the materials that also have the least amount  
**[0:20:13-0:20:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:20:13):**  of toxic chemicals in them.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:20:16):**  The ones that have the smallest environmental footprint in sort of other ways besides carbon  
**[0:20:24-0:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:20:24):**  that are produced more locally to me.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:20:27):**  So they kind of, the low carbon materials options kind of by default seem to bring them  
**[0:20:33-0:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:20:33):**  by all these other benefits that kind of make them good choices in all those other criteria  
**[0:20:40-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:20:40):**  contexts too.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:20:41):**  So it ends up being sort of a really good proxy.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:20:44):**  The low carbon house or the carbon storing house ends up being, you know, the better  
**[0:20:49-0:20:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:20:49):**  house for the occupant, the better house for the planet.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:20:52):**  And because you can make those buildings just as energy efficient as a conventional building,  
**[0:20:59-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:20:59):**  you know, they can be really good in terms of long term.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:21:02):**  Yeah, it's so fortunate that those things correlate so beautifully and it makes making  
**[0:21:06-0:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:21:06):**  a transition or looking at other options that much more appealing because it ticks so many  
**[0:21:11-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:21:11):**  boxes when you make one improvement, it can, you know, have effects down the line for your  
**[0:21:17-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:21:17):**  health, for the planet, for your wallet and so many other ways.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:21:21):**  Now, the co-benefits are great.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:21:24):**  And it's, you know, for somebody who's spent 25 years trying to talk to people about all  
**[0:21:28-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:21:28):**  these, you know, these things in terms of a sort of mainstream adoption of, you know,  
**[0:21:39-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:21:39):**  better practices.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:21:41):**  The carbon issue seems to be the one that is finally gaining traction.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:21:47):**  You know, there's governments are interested in it.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:21:50):**  Companies are interested in it.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:21:51):**  People are interested in it.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:21:52):**  So I sort of feel like, well, I don't need to, you know, browbeat people about chemical  
**[0:21:58-0:22:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:21:58):**  content or browbeat people about ecological impacts of material harvesting.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:22:03):**  If they're interested in low carbon building, all of those benefits are going to come along  
**[0:22:08-0:22:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:22:08):**  with that one decision.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:22:10):**  So it kind of makes it easier to kind of make an improvement in general without having to  
**[0:22:18-0:22:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:22:18):**  convince people that they need to think about those other things.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:22:22):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:22:23):**  Now, let's shift gears here for a second and talk about some of the most important considerations  
**[0:22:27-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:22:27):**  when actually designing a building.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:22:29):**  I know one of the points that I always try and get across in the natural building courses  
**[0:22:33-0:22:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:22:33):**  that I've taught in the past is that you can sort of make or break a good building in the  
**[0:22:37-0:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:22:37):**  design process.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:22:39):**  And even if you're using very ecological materials, also found from site or any of those other  
**[0:22:46-0:22:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:22:46):**  criteria for the material side of things, you can still have an extremely inefficient  
**[0:22:50-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:22:50):**  house if the design is incorrect for its place, its context, and its climate.  
**[0:22:55-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:22:55):**  So in your experience, what are some of the most important things to consider when designing  
**[0:23:01-0:23:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:23:01):**  your own building?  
**[0:23:03-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:23:03):**  I would say right off the bat, size.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:23:06):**  You know, everybody tends to want to make the biggest building that they possibly can  
**[0:23:11-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:23:11):**  for the amount of money that they think they have.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:23:15):**  And I've yet to see the building project where everything goes according to plan and according  
**[0:23:21-0:23:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:23:21):**  to budget.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:23:22):**  And so people want to kind of like start with their budget maxed out right from the design,  
**[0:23:30-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:23:30):**  building as much building as they possibly can for the amount of money they have and  
**[0:23:34-0:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:23:34):**  then running out partway through.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:23:40):**  So keeping a sort of grip on size, I think is really important.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:23:45):**  And then from there, really obvious things like passive solar design, which I think in  
**[0:23:53-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:23:53):**  our climate up here in Ontario, passive solar often gets sort of viewed through the lens  
**[0:23:58-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:23:58):**  of trying to maximize winter solar gain in the building.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:24:05):**  And at the expense of summer shading, which is especially with climate change becoming  
**[0:24:12-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:24:12):**  more and more important.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:24:13):**  And you know, in a lot of ways, because we have a cloudier winter climate here where  
**[0:24:20-0:24:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:24:20):**  you often don't have very much direct summer sunshine or winter sunshine to benefit from,  
**[0:24:26-0:24:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:24:26):**  but you sure get a lot of summer sun.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:24:30):**  Thinking about passive solar from the shading point of view, I think is really important  
**[0:24:35-0:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:24:35):**  and often gets overlooked.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:24:38):**  Yeah, so many areas now are using a ton more energy in the cooling process in the summertime  
**[0:24:44-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:24:44):**  than they do in the heating in the winter, partly because you can heat a home with wood  
**[0:24:50-0:24:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:24:50):**  or other local resources fairly easily in a lot of places, whereas you can't burn wood  
**[0:24:55-0:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:24:55):**  to cool a house, obviously.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:24:58):**  And the infrastructure, especially in cities where you're having that sort of heat island  
**[0:25:03-0:25:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:25:03):**  effect for having paved over so many surfaces, not having much green space is exacerbating  
**[0:25:08-0:25:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:25:08):**  the problem hugely.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:25:10):**  What are some of the things that you recommend for passive cooling techniques in a design?  
**[0:25:17-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:25:17):**  Well mostly, you know, on the south face of the building, making sure that whatever overhangs  
**[0:25:24-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:25:24):**  you have for your building roof overhangs will provide adequate shading through the  
**[0:25:30-0:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:25:30):**  summer.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:25:31):**  So that's sort of the easy low hanging fruit part of things.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:25:36):**  And this especially tends to get ignored on houses that are more than one story.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:25:41):**  So if you have an appropriate say 24 inch roof overhang on a two story building, that  
**[0:25:47-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:25:47):**  will do a great job of shading the second story windows, but the main story windows  
**[0:25:51-0:25:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:25:51):**  are still going to be exposed.  
**[0:25:53-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:25:53):**  So you know, making sure that all of those southern windows have summer shading.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:26:01):**  And then really paying attention to the west side of buildings because it's pretty easy  
**[0:26:05-0:26:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:26:05):**  to design in an appropriate overhang on the south side of a building.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:26:10):**  But on the west, as the sun is sort of lower in the sky, a typical roof overhang is not  
**[0:26:16-0:26:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:26:16):**  going to shade those windows.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:26:17):**  And because it's later in the day and the temperatures are already high and the air  
**[0:26:22-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:26:22):**  temperature has gone up, having that west sun sort of beating into your windows is a  
**[0:26:28-0:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:26:28):**  huge cause of overheating.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:26:30):**  So thinking about ways to either just minimize western windows, to use porches on that side  
**[0:26:36-0:26:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:26:36):**  of the building or other kinds of coverings on the windows, whether that's vines or blinds  
**[0:26:45-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:26:45):**  or coatings directly on the glass.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:26:49):**  But really trying to be conscious that what western windows you have are definitely going  
**[0:26:54-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:26:54):**  to be a pretty major source of overheating.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:26:58):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:27:00):**  Now with all of these design considerations in mind, obviously a lot of them are for saving  
**[0:27:06-0:27:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:27:06):**  money or reducing the carbon footprint for consumption of maintaining the building.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:27:11):**  What would you consider sort of the highest potential or the best that one could hope  
**[0:27:17-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:27:17):**  to do with the design of a building and how it performs and how responsible it acts in  
**[0:27:24-0:27:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:27:24):**  the building process as well?  
**[0:27:26-0:27:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:27:26):**  What would be the ideal?  
**[0:27:28-0:27:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:27:28):**  Well, the ideal would be to use plant-based materials, in particular insulation materials,  
**[0:27:39-0:27:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:27:39):**  to achieve the highest degree of energy efficiency that is practical and that somebody can afford.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:27:46):**  You know, in a design that's got really good passive solar characteristics.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:27:58):**  And then to think really carefully about also the fuel source for the heating and the cooling,  
**[0:28:08-0:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:28:08):**  because we tend to be focused very much on energy as the metric, but it's very different  
**[0:28:14-0:28:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:28:14):**  whether that energy comes from say, as you mentioned, burning wood or burning natural  
**[0:28:20-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:28:20):**  gas or say using electricity.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:28:23):**  I'm here in Ontario, Canada where our grid is actually quite clean.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:28:27):**  So relying on electricity for heating and cooling from a climate change point of view  
**[0:28:33-0:28:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:28:33):**  is actually a pretty great option.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:28:36):**  But that same option in say Massachusetts would be a really bad option.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:28:42):**  So making sure that you think about the fuel use as well, because that'll be a huge driver  
**[0:28:50-0:28:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:28:50):**  of your overall carbon footprint.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:28:53):**  Now, there's been a lot of talk, especially in the last couple of decades, with new standards  
**[0:28:59-0:29:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:28:59):**  for building.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:29:00):**  And I'm talking about sort of the more common ones like the LEED standard and increasingly  
**[0:29:05-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:29:05):**  the Living Building Challenge.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:29:07):**  Have you ever thought of those as good metrics to aspire to, or do you feel like they're  
**[0:29:14-0:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:29:14):**  somewhat misguided and are setting up sort of goalposts in the wrong direction?  
**[0:29:21-0:29:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:29:21):**  I would actually say both at the same time.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:29:26):**  I think, you know, again, any sort of standard that has those kind of metrics applied to  
**[0:29:34-0:29:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:29:34):**  it, you do have to think about why you are trying to achieve those things and what it  
**[0:29:41-0:29:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:29:41):**  is you're trying to achieve in doing them.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:29:44):**  So you know, I do, I really like the living building standard a lot.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:29:49):**  I think there's a lot of really great things in it.  
**[0:29:53-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:29:53):**  But I do think that sometimes it doesn't necessarily answer, you know, the question that the owner  
**[0:30:00-0:30:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:30:00):**  had at the start or the desire that the owner had at the start.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:30:03):**  And so, you know, making sure that if you are using those systems, that you're taking  
**[0:30:12-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:30:12):**  into account what it is you want to achieve as well.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:30:16):**  So the LEED standard is sort of definitely a much lower threshold than Living Building  
**[0:30:24-0:30:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:30:24):**  Challenge.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:30:26):**  So you know, we've done a few LEED projects and for example, on the indoor air quality  
**[0:30:31-0:30:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:30:31):**  side of things, you can get the highest number of points for indoor air quality by, you know,  
**[0:30:38-0:30:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:30:38):**  choosing 16 products that are really, you know, low emitting products.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:30:43):**  But you could also then have 20 products that are high emitting products, but you ticked  
**[0:30:48-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:30:48):**  enough boxes that you got the, you know, the good air quality score from LEED.  
**[0:30:55-0:31:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:30:55):**  So if what you want is that stamp of approval, then ticking those boxes is great.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:31:00):**  If what you want is a completely non-toxic house, then you'd want to go further.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:31:07):**  And the Living Building Challenge has a, you know, a really great standard in terms of,  
**[0:31:11-0:31:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:31:11):**  you know, indoor environment quality.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:31:14):**  Their chemical red list is a pretty good one to work with, you know, to sort of avoid the  
**[0:31:22-0:31:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:31:22):**  big offenders in terms of indoor environment quality.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:31:27):**  But again, like it's possible to go further than what that red list has on it if you want  
**[0:31:33-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:31:33):**  to make sure your environment is really clean.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:31:35):**  I think, you know, all of those standards, they're all trying to work from the point  
**[0:31:41-0:31:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:31:41):**  of view of the sort of existing world of construction and the sort of more natural building approaches.  
**[0:31:55-0:32:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:31:55):**  You tend to meet all of the requirements without having to work very hard because you're sort  
**[0:32:01-0:32:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:32:01):**  of starting from a much better point in terms of the basic characteristics of those materials.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:32:10):**  But what the, what especially the Living Building Challenge can be good for is, you know, a  
**[0:32:14-0:32:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:32:14):**  lot of people who are into natural building think about the walls of their house, you  
**[0:32:19-0:32:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:32:19):**  know, and all the talk is about walls.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:32:21):**  Ram, birch walls, straw bale walls, cob walls, these walls, you know, it's all about walls.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:32:27):**  But something like the Living Building Challenge, you know, really drives you to have to think  
**[0:32:30-0:32:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:32:30):**  about what is your foundation?  
**[0:32:33-0:32:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:32:33):**  What is your roof?  
**[0:32:34-0:32:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:32:34):**  What are your windows?  
**[0:32:35-0:32:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:32:35):**  What are your paints?  
**[0:32:36-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:32:36):**  What are your, you know, there's so much else that goes into the building.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:32:39):**  What are your kitchen cabinets made out of?  
**[0:32:41-0:32:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:32:41):**  So Living Building Challenge kind of, you know, holds the designer and the builder to  
**[0:32:46-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:32:46):**  a high standard across the entire, across the entire building.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:32:52):**  And you know, that can be, that can be really helpful for people who really want to have  
**[0:32:57-0:33:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:32:57):**  sort of like a really great building.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:33:01):**  But then, you know, Living Building Challenge also to get, you know, fully certified, you  
**[0:33:04-0:33:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:33:04):**  have to be, you know, net zero energy and net zero water.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:33:11):**  And that's not, you know, again, you'd want to ask why you're doing that, you know, the  
**[0:33:18-0:33:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:33:18):**  net zero energy thing of producing as much renewables as you use on site.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:33:23):**  Here in Ontario, where our grid is relatively clean, I'm not really achieving much in terms  
**[0:33:29-0:33:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:33:29):**  of climate change or pollution reduction by feeding a whole bunch of my own solar energy  
**[0:33:36-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:33:36):**  into a grid that's already relatively clean.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:33:41):**  Right.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:33:42):**  So, you know, and if I have, you know, the Living Building Challenge wants you to treat  
**[0:33:49-0:33:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:33:49):**  all your black and gray water on site.  
**[0:33:54-0:33:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:33:54):**  But if you're in a city, it doesn't really make that much sense for everybody to have  
**[0:33:58-0:34:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:33:58):**  to have their own septic tank and gray water field, you know, on every city lot when we've  
**[0:34:05-0:34:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:34:05):**  already got this infrastructure that's designed to carry that gray water away.  
**[0:34:12-0:34:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:34:12):**  So you know, I think all of those standards have really good pieces.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:34:17):**  And what we try to do is with our clients, we have a kind of criteria matrix that we  
**[0:34:23-0:34:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:34:23):**  get them to fill out.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:34:24):**  So we have those 10 different criteria we talked about earlier.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:34:28):**  And you know, sort of a one through four scale on all of them.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:34:33):**  And what we tried to do is also in that scale point to which existing building standards  
**[0:34:40-0:34:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:34:40):**  kind of relate to that scale.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:34:42):**  So you know, for example, if you're interested in the amount of waste you're producing, number  
**[0:34:49-0:34:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:34:49):**  one on our scale would be, I'm not going to think about waste at all.  
**[0:34:52-0:34:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:34:52):**  Number two would be, I want to have a simple waste management plan, which would be, you  
**[0:34:57-0:35:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:34:57):**  know, along the lines of like, a simple LEED certification.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:35:02):**  A number three would be, I want to have a fairly comprehensive waste management plan,  
**[0:35:06-0:35:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:35:06):**  which might be like LEED Gold kind of standard, or I want to basically make no construction  
**[0:35:12-0:35:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:35:12):**  waste and that would be like the Living Building Challenge standard.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:35:15):**  So you know, we try to direct people towards the pieces of those standards that might relate  
**[0:35:23-0:35:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:35:23):**  directly to their individual goals.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:35:26):**  And in that way, you know, somebody might not get, say, a LEED Platinum certification,  
**[0:35:32-0:35:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:35:32):**  because they don't want to do all of the things or they want to surpass some of the things.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:35:37):**  But you know, you can sort of see for the criteria that matter to you to the degree  
**[0:35:42-0:35:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:35:42):**  that they matter, which of those, you know, existing programs might be a good place to  
**[0:35:48-0:35:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:35:48):**  go to, to figure out how to do that.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:35:50):**  Yeah, yeah, I love that.  
**[0:35:53-0:35:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:35:53):**  And I think it's a really good way of looking at it so that it doesn't become sort of an  
**[0:35:57-0:36:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:35:57):**  arbitrary system of just ticking off boxes in order to get certifications in order to  
**[0:36:02-0:36:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:36:02):**  pass the test or you're kind of like an education, right?  
**[0:36:06-0:36:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:36:06):**  Just studying to the test and not really learning the entire concept in depth.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:36:11):**  I think, like you mentioned, sort of the forest can be lost for the trees, so to speak, by  
**[0:36:17-0:36:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:36:17):**  narrowly focusing on just the criteria that are put forth by these certifications and  
**[0:36:22-0:36:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:36:22):**  missing some of the context, especially when it comes to a client and contractor or designer  
**[0:36:28-0:36:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:36:28):**  relationship, what's more important for their long term lifestyle?  
**[0:36:33-0:36:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:36:33):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:36:34):**  And you know, because as soon as you make something a system, you do end up with sort  
**[0:36:39-0:36:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:36:39):**  of rules that are well intentioned, but sometimes a bit arbitrary.  
**[0:36:44-0:36:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:36:44):**  So you know, our own house was, we were attempting the Living Building Challenge.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:36:51):**  And so we decided that we wouldn't use any plywood because the plywoods all had formaldehyde  
**[0:36:57-0:37:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:36:57):**  glues in them at the time and they had a no formaldehyde rule in the Living Building Challenge  
**[0:37:01-0:37:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:37:01):**  and we didn't want any formaldehyde.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:37:03):**  So we went to a local sawmill, 150 year old operation, family operation.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:37:10):**  The mill is water powered.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:37:12):**  You know, they get all their logs from within a hundred kilometer radius, like really great  
**[0:37:16-0:37:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:37:16):**  forestry practices and we got them to make us one by a decade to replace plywood.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:37:22):**  But the Living Building Challenge only accepts FSC certified wood.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:37:28):**  And so, you know, we ended up making this choice that for us was, you know, clearly  
**[0:37:33-0:37:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:37:33):**  the right choice for our goals and for, you know, our desire to use really sustainable  
**[0:37:39-0:37:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:37:39):**  wood and eliminate chemicals.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:37:42):**  But from the point of view of the Living Building Challenge, we would have been better off ordering  
**[0:37:47-0:37:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:37:47):**  the no formaldehyde plywood from Oregon and having it shipped here because it was FSC  
**[0:37:53-0:37:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:37:53):**  certified.  
**[0:37:55-0:38:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:37:55):**  And so, you know, I kind of understand the reasons that they would want to do that because  
**[0:38:00-0:38:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:38:00):**  if you don't have a certification for the wood, then it can be arbitrary, you know,  
**[0:38:07-0:38:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:38:07):**  is this good wood or not?  
**[0:38:09-0:38:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:38:09):**  Well, it's also difficult, I would imagine, to follow up on every individual decision  
**[0:38:14-0:38:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:38:14):**  that someone is applying to to get a certification.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:38:17):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:38:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:38:19):**  So I think that they know well.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:38:21):**  That's right.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:38:22):**  So I understand it from that's what I was sort of saying is that as soon as you have  
**[0:38:25-0:38:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:38:25):**  a system and you start applying rules and you start, you know, finding yourself in those  
**[0:38:31-0:38:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:38:31):**  situations.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:38:32):**  And so while I really appreciate and do work with those systems a lot, I think there's  
**[0:38:36-0:38:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:38:36):**  a lot of good stuff in them.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:38:39):**  I don't want to get attached to any of them dogmatically because they can sort of push  
**[0:38:45-0:38:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:38:45):**  you into making decisions just so you get the certification and not so that you're trying  
**[0:38:50-0:38:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:38:50):**  to meet your own goals.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:38:52):**  So we're always trying to help clients meet their own goals.  
**[0:38:56-0:38:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:38:56):**  And if there's a particular rating system that gets them there, that's great.  
**[0:38:59-0:39:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:38:59):**  But if that rating system doesn't, then, you know, I'd gladly steer them in the direction  
**[0:39:05-0:39:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:39:05):**  of making sure that that their own goals are met first.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:39:08):**  Wonderful.  
**[0:39:09-0:39:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:39:09):**  I really like that.  
**[0:39:11-0:39:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:39:11):**  Now again, taking a little bit of a shift, but kind of staying on topic, this idea of  
**[0:39:15-0:39:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:39:15):**  systems, there are certain types of natural building materials that have gained enough  
**[0:39:20-0:39:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:39:20):**  popularity that they're starting to make their way into the codes and regulations and starting  
**[0:39:25-0:39:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:39:25):**  to become systematized, especially now I'm thinking about straw bale, hempcrete and increasingly  
**[0:39:33-0:39:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:39:33):**  the prefab version of straw bales and even light straw clay.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:39:36):**  Now maybe light straw clay a little less so, but they kind of all fall into these categories  
**[0:39:41-0:39:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:39:41):**  of increasingly accepted insulative materials that you could consider to be natural materials.  
**[0:39:47-0:39:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:39:47):**  Now hemp maybe being the most recent one that is becoming widely accepted because of the  
**[0:39:54-0:40:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:39:54):**  legalization of hemp recently and the potential to, I guess, systematize or make it, what  
**[0:40:04-0:40:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:40:04):**  would you call it, like basic enough or standardized enough that it can meet codes anywhere.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:40:13):**  What are your opinions on this increasing standardization of non-standard natural products  
**[0:40:19-0:40:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:40:19):**  like this?  
**[0:40:20-0:40:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:40:20):**  Do you think it's a move in the right direction or do you think it's going to start to kind  
**[0:40:23-0:40:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:40:23):**  of take the soul or the individuality out of these vernacular materials?  
**[0:40:30-0:40:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:40:30):**  I think it really depends a lot on how that ends up happening.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:40:36):**  So I think that the case of straw bale to me is kind of the best case scenario that  
**[0:40:43-0:40:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:40:43):**  the group in the US who actually got straw bale as part of the international residential  
**[0:40:49-0:40:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:40:49):**  code in the US now, but that team of people who worked on getting that done really had  
**[0:40:56-0:41:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:40:56):**  it in their minds to make sure that they weren't creating a sort of one solution or a standard  
**[0:41:04-0:41:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:41:04):**  that meant that everybody had to do it the same everywhere.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:41:08):**  And so because they went into it with that intent, that code allows for load bearing  
**[0:41:16-0:41:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:41:16):**  or Nebraska style buildings, it allows for a wide range of different sort of post and  
**[0:41:20-0:41:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:41:20):**  beam style and frame type buildings.  
**[0:41:25-0:41:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:41:25):**  It's more of a performance standard than it is a bunch of prescriptions.  
**[0:41:33-0:41:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:41:33):**  So because there are a hundred different ways you could make a straw bale building, that  
**[0:41:40-0:41:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:41:40):**  code was written in a way that makes sure that 98 of those hundred ways are completely  
**[0:41:46-0:41:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:41:46):**  acceptable.  
**[0:41:47-0:41:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:41:47):**  So I think if codes move in that direction, so rather than saying, one of the things that  
**[0:41:57-0:42:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:41:57):**  a straw bale code could have said is you've got to have a cement or lime based plaster.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:42:04):**  But what the folks doing, the US codes did was said, as long as your plaster meets this  
**[0:42:10-0:42:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:42:10):**  minimum strength requirement, then it's suitable.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:42:14):**  And so then that leaves the door open to earthen based plasters.  
**[0:42:19-0:42:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:42:19):**  And so, the code doesn't say you have to use this type of straw or this type of twine on  
**[0:42:25-0:42:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:42:25):**  your straw.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:42:26):**  It just says a bale needs to be this density, have a minimum of this amount of moisture  
**[0:42:32-0:42:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:42:32):**  content.  
**[0:42:33-0:42:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:42:33):**  And so again, that sort of leaves it open to lots of different types of straw being  
**[0:42:39-0:42:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:42:39):**  able to meet that.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:42:40):**  So I think as long as the codification happens in that way, it's a really positive thing  
**[0:42:47-0:42:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:42:47):**  because that code existing there just makes it accessible to so many more people to be  
**[0:42:53-0:42:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:42:53):**  able to do these buildings so much more affordably without having to have custom engineering  
**[0:42:59-0:43:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:42:59):**  and potentially a code consultant and complicating that whole permit process.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:43:08):**  I think that's really positive.  
**[0:43:10-0:43:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:43:10):**  So hopefully, things continue to go down that path as some of these other materials start  
**[0:43:17-0:43:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:43:17):**  to make their way into the codes.  
**[0:43:20-0:43:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:43:20):**  Now within your own experience working around codes and restrictions and regulations, what  
**[0:43:25-0:43:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:43:25):**  have been some of the biggest challenges in following your conscience and developing the  
**[0:43:32-0:43:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:43:32):**  best buildings that you know how to and the restrictions that are in place that would  
**[0:43:38-0:43:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:43:38):**  maybe limit the potential of what you would like to do in order to comply with what the  
**[0:43:43-0:43:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:43:43):**  state or regulatory bodies require of you?  
**[0:43:48-0:43:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:43:48):**  Well I think one thing that I've learned is to not see those codes necessarily as restrictions.  
**[0:43:55-0:44:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:43:55):**  At the core, all codes are public safety documents.  
**[0:44:01-0:44:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:44:01):**  And I learned a long time ago from a colleague, David Eisenberg, that really we want the exact  
**[0:44:09-0:44:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:44:09):**  same things from a building that a code official does.  
**[0:44:14-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:44:14):**  We want to ensure that this building is safe for all the occupants.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:44:19):**  We want to make sure that it's safe for a long time.  
**[0:44:22-0:44:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:44:22):**  We want to make sure that it can withstand whatever climatic conditions or ground conditions  
**[0:44:30-0:44:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:44:30):**  exist.  
**[0:44:31-0:44:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:44:31):**  So like we share all of those goals and in fact we have a whole bunch of other public  
**[0:44:37-0:44:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:44:37):**  health and safety goals that are complementary to that.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:44:41):**  We want to not just make the building safe kind of structurally, we want to make sure  
**[0:44:45-0:44:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:44:45):**  that it's safe in terms of indoor environment quality.  
**[0:44:49-0:44:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:44:49):**  We want to make sure it's in terms of it's not wrecking the whole rest of the planet  
**[0:44:54-0:44:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:44:54):**  in order to make a safe haven for an occupant.  
**[0:44:57-0:45:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:44:57):**  So we're not really at odds with the intent of the codes at all.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:45:07):**  And I think even just approaching code officials in that way where it's like, you know, instead  
**[0:45:13-0:45:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:45:13):**  of going in bristling and ready for a fight, we go in saying, hey, we want the same things  
**[0:45:22-0:45:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:45:22):**  you want and this is how we're interpreting your notion of safety.  
**[0:45:28-0:45:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:45:28):**  And if you look at it, we're actually trying to do more of what you're trying to do than  
**[0:45:34-0:45:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:45:34):**  less of what you're trying to do.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:45:38):**  And you know, lots of the codes in their sort of preambles talk about the fact that they're  
**[0:45:44-0:45:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:45:44):**  not meant to restrict or limit people and what they want to do, but to just ensure that  
**[0:45:52-0:45:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:45:52):**  those things are done safely.  
**[0:45:54-0:45:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:45:54):**  So I think coming at it from that point of view is really helpful.  
**[0:45:59-0:46:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:45:59):**  We've gotten really good here in Ontario, there's sort of a system for what's called  
**[0:46:04-0:46:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:46:04):**  alternative compliance.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:46:06):**  And so we've gotten really good at sort of writing alternative compliance packages where  
**[0:46:10-0:46:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:46:10):**  we find all the areas of the code where a building official might have questions about  
**[0:46:17-0:46:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:46:17):**  what we're doing, find, you know, relevant test results from Canada and around the world  
**[0:46:23-0:46:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:46:23):**  that kind of show that what we're doing meets the minimum intent of the code and in fact  
**[0:46:29-0:46:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:46:29):**  sort of surpasses it in most cases.  
**[0:46:33-0:46:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:46:33):**  But I think that the thing that we found, it's not really limiting, but the difficulty  
**[0:46:39-0:46:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:46:39):**  in working with alternatives and codes is just you have to expect to take more time  
**[0:46:47-0:46:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:46:47):**  to prepare those documents.  
**[0:46:50-0:46:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:46:50):**  You have to expect to take more time to have the conversations at the building department  
**[0:46:54-0:46:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:46:54):**  to get the permit.  
**[0:46:56-0:47:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:46:56):**  And you may be sort of taking on some additional costs if you need, you know, a structural  
**[0:47:01-0:47:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:47:01):**  engineer involved or an architect involved or a code consultant involved.  
**[0:47:05-0:47:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:47:05):**  So, you know, we've never not been able to do something that we've proposed to do.  
**[0:47:11-0:47:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:47:11):**  And we've done some things that I think people would think are pretty out there an alternative.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:47:15):**  But everything we've done, you know, has received approval from a building department here.  
**[0:47:21-0:47:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:47:21):**  But it's, you know, it hasn't always been the straightest, easiest path to make that  
**[0:47:26-0:47:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:47:26):**  happen.  
**[0:47:27-0:47:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:47:27):**  You know, sometimes we have to work at it.  
**[0:47:30-0:47:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:47:30):**  Sure, and the more people like you and other natural builders kind of work directly with  
**[0:47:35-0:47:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:47:35):**  these coding bodies and regulatory bodies, it sort of it dismantles the hurdles for the  
**[0:47:41-0:47:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:47:41):**  next person coming there because you'll have established sort of a rapport and a system  
**[0:47:45-0:47:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:47:45):**  or at least a reference that someone can point to, especially if you're working at a higher  
**[0:47:49-0:47:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:47:49):**  quality and set a good example that I would imagine would make it much easier for other  
**[0:47:56-0:48:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:47:56):**  people even with less experience to be able to build with these methods, materials or  
**[0:48:01-0:48:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:48:01):**  techniques.  
**[0:48:02-0:48:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:48:02):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:48:03-0:48:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:48:03):**  And I think, you know, for for, you know, owner builders who are thinking about approaching  
**[0:48:08-0:48:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:48:08):**  a building department, it's really beneficial to, you know, take a couple of minutes and  
**[0:48:13-0:48:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:48:13):**  think about what you're doing from the point of view of the person on the other side of  
**[0:48:18-0:48:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:48:18):**  that desk.  
**[0:48:19-0:48:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:48:19):**  So you're walking in with possibly zero building experience, likely not a great depth of code  
**[0:48:28-0:48:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:48:28):**  knowledge and an idea for, you know, a material or an approach or a system or possibly a whole  
**[0:48:35-0:48:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:48:35):**  bunch of them that, you know, the code official has no experience with and no precedent for.  
**[0:48:42-0:48:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:48:42):**  And so, you know, you have all of that sort of baggage sitting on your shoulder when you  
**[0:48:47-0:48:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:48:47):**  go in. And so I think it's really important to kind of acknowledge that and, you know,  
**[0:48:52-0:48:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:48:52):**  think about what can I do to alleviate this person's concerns and their real concerns  
**[0:48:59-0:49:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:48:59):**  if you think about it from that point of view, like building a building department is taking  
**[0:49:04-0:49:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:49:04):**  on the liability for that building for decades to come, long after you as the owner builder  
**[0:49:10-0:49:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:49:10):**  have moved on possibly.  
**[0:49:14-0:49:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:49:14):**  And so if they're looking at somebody with zero experience, zero knowledge and a bunch  
**[0:49:18-0:49:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:49:18):**  of what they see as kooky ideas, you know, the onus is on you to make sure that that  
**[0:49:24-0:49:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:49:24):**  you're able to say, I know you feel like this and that here's what I'm going to do to make  
**[0:49:29-0:49:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:49:29):**  sure that, you know, I'm not exposing you to undo liability from your end.  
**[0:49:36-0:49:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:49:36):**  Yeah. And I think that attitude of collaboration and cooperation goes a long way, especially  
**[0:49:42-0:49:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:49:42):**  when first making contact with these. I know through following your work and the work of  
**[0:49:47-0:49:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:49:47):**  Siggi Coco in the United States and April McGill and some of my other, you know, inspirational  
**[0:49:54-0:50:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:49:54):**  builders that I follow, they've all sort of come with that attitude, with that cooperative  
**[0:50:00-0:50:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:50:00):**  spirit when addressing these bodies that many other people try to avoid or perhaps go in  
**[0:50:05-0:50:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:50:05):**  with an antagonistic attitude. And I've only heard good results by starting the conversation  
**[0:50:11-0:50:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:50:11):**  out on that footing.  
**[0:50:13-0:50:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:50:13):**  Yeah, I think, you know, and one of the unexpected consequences of the career path that I've  
**[0:50:20-0:50:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:50:20):**  had is that I actually know my Ontario building code extremely well. You know, I can now have  
**[0:50:24-0:50:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:50:24):**  those conversations with building officials where, you know, I actually have my code references  
**[0:50:32-0:50:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:50:32):**  down and, you know, know what the code says and where to find things in the code. And  
**[0:50:37-0:50:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:50:37):**  that's, you know, as a professional, that's really helpful. I definitely didn't have that  
**[0:50:41-0:50:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:50:41):**  as a, you know, when I was a first time owner builder. And it's, you know, it's too much  
**[0:50:47-0:50:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:50:47):**  to expect an owner builder to do that. But, you know, maybe at least owning a copy of  
**[0:50:53-0:50:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:50:53):**  the code and having a sense of even just how the document works and what's, you know, what's  
**[0:50:59-0:51:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:50:59):**  expected of you when you go in, I think is really important.  
**[0:51:05-0:51:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:51:05):**  With that in mind, let's talk a little bit about the series that you are co-editing with  
**[0:51:10-0:51:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:51:10):**  New Society Publishers, the Essential Building series. What was the vision behind this series  
**[0:51:16-0:51:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:51:16):**  of books and the base of education that you're hoping to get out to a wider readership, especially  
**[0:51:22-0:51:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:51:22):**  if people aspiring to build for themselves?  
**[0:51:24-0:51:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:51:24):**  Well, basically, I feel like the, you know, everything that I've done in my career since  
**[0:51:30-0:51:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:51:30):**  my first house has been an attempt to try to figure out how to provide the information  
**[0:51:38-0:51:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:51:38):**  that I wish I had when I was starting. So, you know, all the books I've written and all  
**[0:51:43-0:51:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:51:43):**  the courses I teach, you know, to a large degree are sort of aimed at, you know, boy,  
**[0:51:48-0:51:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:51:48):**  I wish these are the things that I wish I knew when I was getting started. So, the Essentials  
**[0:51:56-0:52:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:51:56):**  book series from New Society is, you know, kind of taking each of the key kind of natural  
**[0:52:04-0:52:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:52:04):**  building materials and treating it as its own subject and, you know, really trying to  
**[0:52:11-0:52:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:52:11):**  think about it the way we've just, in the way we've had this conversation, like, how  
**[0:52:15-0:52:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:52:15):**  does this work from all these different criteria levels? How does it work from the code? And,  
**[0:52:22-0:52:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:52:22):**  you know, what are some of the sort of like, you know, key requirements of those systems,  
**[0:52:29-0:52:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:52:29):**  you know, we provide, I guess, in the way that we were talking about the straw bale  
**[0:52:34-0:52:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:52:34):**  code in the US being sort of very open-ended. The idea with the Essentials series is, you  
**[0:52:39-0:52:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:52:39):**  know, not here is the way to work with this material, but here are all the ways you can  
**[0:52:44-0:52:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:52:44):**  work with this material and kind of the pluses and minuses of each of these approaches, you  
**[0:52:48-0:52:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:52:48):**  know, within that topic. So, you know, if it's hempcrete, there's not just, you know,  
**[0:52:55-0:52:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:52:55):**  one way to do hempcrete. The book looks at a bunch of different framing systems, a bunch  
**[0:52:59-0:53:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:52:59):**  of different, you know, binders that you can use, a bunch of different finishes you can  
**[0:53:04-0:53:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:53:04):**  put on the wall and, you know, tries to make the case for each of them in terms of what  
**[0:53:12-0:53:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:53:12):**  are their advantages and what are their disadvantages.  
**[0:53:16-0:53:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:53:16):**  And so through this understanding of so many varied materials and techniques, what sort  
**[0:53:22-0:53:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:53:22):**  of important considerations for people aspiring to build a natural home for themselves? What  
**[0:53:26-0:53:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:53:26):**  sort of advice would you give to them starting out?  
**[0:53:30-0:53:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:53:30):**  The biggest one would be you sort of the upfront time that you spend researching and studying  
**[0:53:38-0:53:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:53:38):**  and thinking is the best investment that you're going to make. So, you know, taking some courses,  
**[0:53:45-0:53:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:53:45):**  getting some books, going and looking at buildings and talking to owners, you know, putting together  
**[0:53:55-0:54:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:53:55):**  a really good design and construction team, you know, all of those things are so important  
**[0:54:02-0:54:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:54:02):**  in how the building comes together. And, you know, the people I've seen have the sort of  
**[0:54:12-0:54:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:54:12):**  worst time in trying to tackle this themselves are the people who've been really rushing  
**[0:54:20-0:54:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:54:20):**  it. You know, they're trying to, you know, go from design to building in six months and,  
**[0:54:27-0:54:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:54:27):**  you know, they're just making decisions really quickly and without a lot of thought and without  
**[0:54:32-0:54:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:54:32):**  a lot of research and that pretty much always turns around and kind of like bites you in  
**[0:54:38-0:54:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:54:38):**  the butt. So, you know, just take the time to, you know, know that, yeah, this is probably  
**[0:54:43-0:54:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:54:43):**  the biggest project you're ever going to undertake. It's probably the most money you're ever going  
**[0:54:47-0:54:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:54:47):**  to spend in your life. You're going to be living with the results for a really long  
**[0:54:51-0:54:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:54:51):**  time and the results are probably going to outlive you. So there's, you know, you've  
**[0:54:58-0:55:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:54:58):**  got some responsibility to future generations. So, you know, give that a decision of that  
**[0:55:06-0:55:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:55:06):**  scope or a project of that scope, you know, the benefit of some really good deep consideration  
**[0:55:13-0:55:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:55:13):**  before you plow forward.  
**[0:55:15-0:55:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:55:15):**  Absolutely. And with that in mind, talking about research and different avenues to get  
**[0:55:21-0:55:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:55:21):**  more information, can you tell our listeners about how they can get in touch with you,  
**[0:55:25-0:55:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:55:25):**  the Endeavour Centre in particular, and how they can find all of those resources that  
**[0:55:30-0:55:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-8m244ldq8to9haahuafbwsxafb8elr/#t=0:55:30):**  you've been putting out for so many years?

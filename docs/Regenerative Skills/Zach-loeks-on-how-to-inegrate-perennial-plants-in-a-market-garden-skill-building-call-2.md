**[0:01:49-0:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:01:49):**  I'm the author of the Permaculture Market Garden and the Edible Ecosystem Solution.

**[0:02:04-0:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:02:04):**  in landscape.

**[0:02:12-0:02:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:02:12):**  any scale farm all the way down to, you know, urban settings.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:02:17):**  And I right now I run the Ecosystem Solution Institute, which works to create various solutions  
**[0:02:25-0:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:02:25):**  that use ecosystem design for home growers, homesteaders, farmers.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:02:31):**  And we also run a nursery on my farm where we nursery a lot of plants that are plants  
**[0:02:38-0:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:02:38):**  that we recommend for farms and homes and homesteads to increase edible biodiversity  
**[0:02:44-0:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:02:44):**  on their property for commercial purposes, as well as for just home resilience.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:02:50):**  So that's so I don't produce vegetables anymore as a as a big commercial operation.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:02:57):**  But at one point, I was running a 300 member CSA.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:03:02):**  I was selling it to urban farmers markets on Saturday and Sunday.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:03:06):**  And I was doing online sales through an online food co-op that brought in from multiple producers  
**[0:03:13-0:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:03:13):**  to produce a custom basket.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:03:14):**  So the peak of my market gardening days, that was that was what I was doing in terms of  
**[0:03:21-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:03:21):**  vegetable production, as well as the small fruits and, and things that I was including  
**[0:03:25-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:03:25):**  in that.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:03:27):**  And yeah, so that's just a little more there.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:03:30):**  And I guess sorry, we got our times mixed up.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:03:32):**  Yeah, I'm not sure how you know this, this world in a million time zones, I, I was like,  
**[0:03:38-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:03:38):**  Okay, I'm right on time.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:03:42):**  But yeah, my bad.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:03:44):**  I'll take the blame on that.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:03:45):**  Thanks for the introduction.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:03:47):**  And like you're saying you will see you first wrote the book, the permaculture market garden,  
**[0:03:52-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:03:52):**  which talked about integrating permaculture concepts into more of the high efficiency  
**[0:03:56-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:03:56):**  and strip down necessities of, of market gardening and making that a profitable enterprise.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:04:03):**  You want to start by talking about kind of balancing that efficiency and diversity for  
**[0:04:08-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:04:08):**  the health of the ecosystem in a market garden setting?  
**[0:04:12-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:04:12):**  Yeah, I mean, I think a lot of my previous work and the work that we're working on right  
**[0:04:19-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:04:19):**  now through the Institute, it can be encapsulated in our perma bed system, which really is about  
**[0:04:28-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:04:28):**  understanding how to create organized patterns.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:04:32):**  It, you know, it occurred to me that the the benefits of including more perennials in our  
**[0:04:40-0:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:04:40):**  market gardens or vegetable market gardens could be better achieved when we had a ratio  
**[0:04:47-0:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:04:47):**  and a pattern and a system of organization around including them into the landscape.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:04:55):**  And this comes from permanence in our garden beds.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:05:00):**  And sometimes we have, you know, raised garden beds on the market garden and sometimes we  
**[0:05:05-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:05:05):**  don't.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:05:06):**  And sometimes we have a garden bed that we grow in and we consider it a raised garden  
**[0:05:11-0:05:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:05:11):**  bed.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:05:12):**  But actually, it's just fluffed soil from the tiller.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:05:14):**  It's not really being raised.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:05:17):**  And often we plow that whole field at the end of the year, and then we recreate the  
**[0:05:25-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:05:25):**  beds every season.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:05:26):**  So it doesn't actually have that permanence.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:05:28):**  So the permanent bed system, you know, one aspect of it is committing to a permanent  
**[0:05:33-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:05:33):**  place in your field for your raised garden bed.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:05:38):**  This is not plowed at the end of the year.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:05:41):**  These beds may be reformed by pulling path material and reforming over, which achieves  
**[0:05:46-0:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:05:46):**  much of the same benefits of plowing in terms of, you know, helping prevent disease cycles  
**[0:05:52-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:05:52):**  through some soil coverage, helping to create a reforming to raise up in case there has  
**[0:06:00-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:06:00):**  been some settling.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:06:02):**  But overall, there's less settling because this isn't a bed that's formed from tillage.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:06:06):**  It's a bed that's formed from physical movement of the soil upwards.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:06:12):**  And so part of the benefit of this can be seen as many other things such as soil health.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:06:19):**  But in terms of the integration of annuals and perennials, once you commit to permanent  
**[0:06:25-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:06:25):**  beds in your landscape, and you can actually go through and even, you know, number them  
**[0:06:30-0:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:06:30):**  or name them or whatever you want, once you commit to that permanence, you commit to the

**[0:07:58-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:07:58):**  Talking about those opportunities, can you explain some of the ones that you expected

**[0:08:09-0:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:08:09):**  and have benefits for the ecosystem as well as for the customer side?  
**[0:08:14-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:08:14):**  Yeah, for sure.

**[0:08:24-0:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:08:24):**  and I experienced from other people talking at conferences was the what it meant to invest

**[0:08:36-0:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:08:36):**  cash cropping too, we're used to an annual investment and an annual return.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:08:41):**  So the idea of making an investment where you don't have return for several years is  
**[0:08:47-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:08:47):**  something that you have to, you know, wrap your mind around.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:08:51):**  And so part of the work we were doing is looking at how that investment was paying us back  
**[0:08:58-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:08:58):**  in the long term, but also looking at ways that it was paying us back in the short term.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:09:03):**  And examples of that included being able to produce high quality summer spinach and salad  
**[0:09:10-0:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:09:10):**  greens in the in the shadows and in the protection of perennial bed guilds.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:09:17):**  And you know, I was just making a ton of money growing high quality salad greens and in the  
**[0:09:24-0:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:09:24):**  spring and if you can keep it going in the summer, it's even more profitable.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:09:30):**  But you need to prevent bolting.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:09:32):**  We you know, where I am in Canada, we get really we're continental.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:09:38):**  So we get really cold, cold winters, and we get really hot summers.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:09:42):**  I mean, it gets hot.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:09:44):**  So this was a great solution to show how investing in perennials is a good long term investment  
**[0:09:53-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:09:53):**  because I have diversified income.  
**[0:09:55-0:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:09:55):**  You know, within a few years, you have raspberries, you can add to your CSA basket.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:09:59):**  And then after that, you start to see cherries.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:10:03):**  And then after that, you start to see plums and then hazelnuts and pears and apples.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:10:09):**  But at the same time, we were seeing short term immediate return in terms of improving  
**[0:10:15-0:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:10:15):**  the quality of our annual production.

**[0:10:24-0:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:10:24):**  and more consistently.

**[0:11:13-0:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:11:13):**  ratios.

**[0:12:52-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:12:52):**  these maples and oaks and such, became just like the richest chocolate brown soil.

**[0:13:53-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:13:53):**  And any perennial bed can be understood as a source of quality compost.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:13:59):**  And when it fits within the design of a triad or a three bed unit that we use, we're able  
**[0:14:04-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:14:04):**  to see that those beds just adjacent are really improving in their soil health quite quickly.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:14:11):**  And then we can move it out from there if we want as well.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:14:14):**  So it protects soil life, it adds organic matter, the roots are breaking up and improving  
**[0:14:20-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:14:20):**  drainage.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:14:21):**  And as we all know, drainage is really important for productivity in agriculture.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:14:25):**  So when we create regular patterns of perennial hedges into our farm landscape, we're getting  
**[0:14:32-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:14:32):**  regular drainage systems that aren't just trying to throw the water into the ditches  
**[0:14:40-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:14:40):**  so that it can run quickly away, you know, down to the, you know, the nearest river to  
**[0:14:46-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:14:46):**  the sea, but rather finding solutions to get drainage while localizing those water reserves.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:14:53):**  And so that's what these trees do as well as also stopping snow in these strips so that  
**[0:14:59-0:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:14:59):**  we have a slower melt so that we're also slowing that period of water rush, reducing the intensity  
**[0:15:07-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:15:07):**  of the melt period.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:15:09):**  So again, more water can be absorbed into the soil locally, because we're giving it  
**[0:15:13-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:15:13):**  the time to do so.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:15:15):**  A bare open field is just completely unnatural.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:15:20):**  There's no system that exists, no ecosystem that exists that does what we do in agriculture.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:15:26):**  And so that's why we have so many problems.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:15:29):**  I would think.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:15:31):**  So let's go into some detail about that triad system, because it's interesting from a design  
**[0:15:36-0:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:15:36):**  perspective.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:15:37):**  But can you give me an example of an actual triad that you implemented on your farm, and  
**[0:15:43-0:15:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:15:43):**  why you chose the different cultivars that you did and how they work together?  
**[0:15:48-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:15:48):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:15:49):**  So for the permabed system, because it's a system that, I mean, it can be brought down  
**[0:15:54-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:15:54):**  to the micro.  
**[0:15:55-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:15:55):**  Again, I talk about that more in the edible ecosystem solution.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:15:59):**  But in the permaculture market garden, we really look at more macro solutions.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:16:04):**  And the triad is the unit of gill design.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:16:07):**  It's a three bed unit of gill design.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:16:09):**  So if your permabeds are, you know, four foot wide or five foot wide, or if you're on the  
**[0:16:13-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:16:13):**  largest scale, I would maybe recommend five and a half to six foot wide.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:16:18):**  Again, based on the equipment you use, are you using a BCS walking tractor?  
**[0:16:22-0:16:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:16:22):**  Are you using a small compact tractor?  
**[0:16:24-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:16:24):**  Are you using a mid-sized tractor, etc.?  
**[0:16:27-0:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:16:27):**  If you're on hand tools, you'll be smaller.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:16:28):**  But anyways, regardless, the three beds makes a really good unit for gill design.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:16:33):**  And we call that the triad.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:16:35):**  An example of a gill is something that takes into consideration a few different things.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:16:42):**  And I approach gill design more from a point of view of first, what I call umbrella management,  
**[0:16:52-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:16:52):**  and essentially how you manage your crops efficiently, and then get into choosing plants  
**[0:16:58-0:17:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:16:58):**  that can do the companion well for other reasons.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:17:02):**  Because in my experience, having diversity of plants automatically instills in the landscape  
**[0:17:10-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:17:10):**  those ideas of pest confusion, pest deterrence, you know, biodiversity benefits, improvement  
**[0:17:16-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:17:16):**  of soil.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:17:17):**  So I don't design my gills from that starting point, because you may end up forgetting to  
**[0:17:24-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:17:24):**  design around really important things, such as efficiency of harvest and accessibility.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:17:32):**  And so an example of how I start from this point of view would be that if I had three  
**[0:17:37-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:17:37):**  beds in my triad, the center bed would go into a key species or a key guild.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:17:44):**  And that would usually be those plants that are the longest maturing or the largest plants,  
**[0:17:50-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:17:50):**  because I really want to design around them.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:17:52):**  If I plant trees that have a solid stem in the middle, that bed really becomes something  
**[0:17:57-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:17:57):**  I can no longer drive over, but I want to be able to drive adjacent.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:18:02):**  So if I put a guild of say fruit trees in that middle bed, perhaps I put in something  
**[0:18:08-0:18:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:18:08):**  like a dwarf cherry as the key species, and then I have other companions I find later,  
**[0:18:14-0:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:18:14):**  the adjacent bed, I want to make sure that at least one of these adjacent beds has good  
**[0:18:18-0:18:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:18:18):**  access.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:18:20):**  So does that mean that I leave it bare so that I can drive a tractor alongside for easy  
**[0:18:24-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:18:24):**  harvest?  
**[0:18:25-0:18:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:18:25):**  Or do I find an opportunity for an alley crop that's going to allow accessibility?  
**[0:18:31-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:18:31):**  So an example of that would be why not plant asparagus there, because if I plant asparagus,  
**[0:18:38-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:18:38):**  I get an early crop, which is beneficial to the bottom line of the farm, but these crops  
**[0:18:45-0:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:18:45):**  don't prevent me accessing my cherries or my plums or my fruit trees later, because  
**[0:18:52-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:18:52):**  the asparagus is finished.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:18:54):**  You know, maybe it fronds, you can mow it, and you can drive right over it without actually  
**[0:18:58-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:18:58):**  having any effect on the crop because your wheat, you know, your tires are in the path  
**[0:19:04-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:19:04):**  and the bed top is, you know, safe underneath the belly.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:19:08):**  If I put a crop of raspberries in this other bed over here, on the sunny side, I could  
**[0:19:16-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:19:16):**  find that those raspberries are getting good harvest access because on the other side from  
**[0:19:21-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:19:21):**  it, outside of that perennial triad, I'm now into my annual garden.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:19:27):**  And so as long as the crop over there is one that allows me to have access to my raspberries  
**[0:19:31-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:19:31):**  for picking, for instance, it could be an early spinach or an early radish or something  
**[0:19:36-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:19:36):**  like that, I'll have good access for picking my raspberries.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:19:39):**  And at the same time, my raspberries are able to give a little bit of shade and protection  
**[0:19:44-0:19:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:19:44):**  on that sunny side against my fruit trees, which in our environment, we get sun scald  
**[0:19:51-0:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:19:51):**  on the fruit trees from a lot of reflection off the snow in the wintertime.  
**[0:19:55-0:19:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:19:55):**  So we're getting a little bit of protection there.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:19:58):**  And at the same time, by not integrating the raspberries in line, in this case with the  
**[0:20:05-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:20:05):**  fruit trees, which is possible, you can do a fruit raspberry guild.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:20:09):**  But one of the benefits for larger farm of integrating the raspberries in their own bed  
**[0:20:13-0:20:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:20:13):**  is that raspberries can benefit from being mowed and being recomposed and allowing to  
**[0:20:20-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:20:20):**  regenerate.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:20:22):**  And you can't do that the moment you integrate it with the cherries or plums, etc.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:20:27):**  So I consider that a regenerative perennial, and I put it in its own bed, or sometimes

**[0:20:35-0:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:20:35):**  And it also allows you the opportunity of harvesting those suckers super efficiently  
**[0:20:40-0:20:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:20:40):**  in order to propagate them out into other places on the farm, because you can move through  
**[0:20:45-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:20:45):**  and undercut that entire raspberry bed.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:20:47):**  So that would be what I would consider a base design for a triad, a bed and raspberries,  
**[0:20:53-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:20:53):**  a bed in a chosen fruit, and a bed in asparagus, the asparagus being doubling as an alley,  
**[0:21:01-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:21:01):**  the fruit trees being your key species that you're designing around primarily understanding  
**[0:21:05-0:21:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:21:05):**  access, and then a regenerative raspberry bed over here for efficient picking distribution  
**[0:21:10-0:21:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:21:10):**  of future plants.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:21:12):**  And then you would diversify within that, choosing other plants that you might want,  
**[0:21:17-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:21:17):**  you might decide to grow gooseberries in between those fruit trees because they do well in  
**[0:21:21-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:21:21):**  that dappled shade.

**[0:21:29-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:21:29):**  to have pollen that's ready just before the fruit trees that are your key variety, because  
**[0:21:36-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:21:36):**  you want to make sure the bees are already in the neighborhood.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:21:39):**  So then we start to design around those other ecosystem services.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:21:46):**  So I guess to encapsulate that, I designed with a three bed triad in the perma bed system,  
**[0:21:52-0:21:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:21:52):**  and I work from the point of view of efficient management.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:21:56):**  I call it umbrella management because I try to make sure that everything that's under  
**[0:22:00-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:22:00):**  that umbrella of that guild are things that work well together.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:22:04):**  You don't want to put a bunch of entities under an umbrella that aren't actually going

**[0:22:20-0:22:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:22:20):**  type of companionship, that's the easy part.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:22:25):**  That's the easy part.

**[0:22:33-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:22:33):**  That's not part of the hard part in guild design for commercial growers is creating  
**[0:22:38-0:22:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:22:38):**  management efficiency because we all work quite intensively over the course of the summers.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:22:43):**  I know you all appreciate.

**[0:22:47-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:22:47):**  All right, so let's talk about some of the other aspects of management.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:22:51):**  Certainly getting your irrigation system right from the beginning is going to be key.  
**[0:22:55-0:22:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:22:55):**  And it's one of the things that we were talking about among the other market gardeners in  
**[0:22:59-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:22:59):**  this group before you showed up.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:23:00):**  Can you tell me about how you plan the irrigation system to accommodate these perennial plantings?  
**[0:23:06-0:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:23:06):**  Yeah, well, you know, for irrigation, my rule of thumb is first healthy soil because healthy  
**[0:23:13-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:23:13):**  soil holds water.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:23:15):**  So then you're better in drought and healthy soil drains.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:23:19):**  So then you're better being able to get in.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:23:21):**  So first of all, by having a permanent bed system with raised permanent beds, investing  
**[0:23:25-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:23:25):**  in that and by integrating annuals and perennials, my beds are drier sooner when I want them  
**[0:23:30-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:23:30):**  drier and they stay moist longer when I want the water.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:23:34):**  So that's always number one.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:23:37):**  Then I go to, you know, the next layer, which is, you know, hoses and drip and sprinklers  
**[0:23:44-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:23:44):**  and water source and etc.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:23:46):**  And then my next thing I would say is, you know, have a system that has several backups  
**[0:23:54-0:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:23:54):**  for water source.  
**[0:23:55-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:23:55):**  Because you know, irrigation hoses, you know, you can have as many sprinklers and everything  
**[0:24:00-0:24:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:24:00):**  you want, but at the end of the day, it comes down to the source.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:24:04):**  How much water do you have when you need it?  
**[0:24:07-0:24:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:24:07):**  So you know, what we have been working on, you know, on the farm and the Institute over  
**[0:24:12-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:24:12):**  the years is now something that is a three source system.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:24:16):**  So we have water catchment off of our barn, which collects in tanks, and that's a reserve.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:24:23):**  And then we pump from that reserve into the fields.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:24:27):**  But that system that is pumping from that tank is also connected to a well.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:24:35):**  So if there is not enough water in the tank from the roof, we supplement it from the well.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:24:41):**  And we're glad that it goes into the tank because we don't want to shock our plants  
**[0:24:45-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:24:45):**  with a bunch of well water in the middle of July.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:24:50):**  They don't want that.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:24:51):**  And then that system is also in conjunction with a pond fed system so that we're able  
**[0:24:57-0:25:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:24:57):**  to actually irrigate directly from a pond as well.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:25:02):**  And while irrigating from the pond, it tops up the tanks.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:25:06):**  So then we're able to choose not to irrigate from the pond in the future.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:25:10):**  And we've our tanks are topped up in case it hasn't been raining as well.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:25:15):**  And then the pond system is a bit stepped right now so that we're creating more wetland  
**[0:25:20-0:25:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:25:20):**  around the pond so that we are balancing how much we draw from the pond while not removing  
**[0:25:28-0:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:25:28):**  so much water that we are harming the ecosystem there.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:25:32):**  Because the reason we're able to dig a successful pond is because this was originally a wetland  
**[0:25:37-0:25:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:25:37):**  in a site that had been converted to a very lush hayfield, but one that was also very  
**[0:25:44-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:25:44):**  hard to access a lot of the time because it was so wet.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:25:47):**  And now what we're doing is we're furthering our water resources by creating bioswales  
**[0:25:55-0:25:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:25:55):**  in the field so that just like you can take a...  
**[0:25:59-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:25:59):**  What's so cool about the permabed system is that each bed you can assign a value.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:26:05):**  So in this case, you can take a triad in the permabed system, but decide that it's gonna  
**[0:26:10-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:26:10):**  become a linear pond.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:26:13):**  Or in this case, we're building bioswales where the two outer beds are going into water  
**[0:26:19-0:26:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:26:19):**  loving species like elderberry for market.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:26:22):**  The middle bed is being excavated out.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:26:25):**  So it's becoming an upside down permabed.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:26:29):**  It's a permabed whose crop is water harvest and we're creating bioswale layers.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:26:34):**  And then we're seeding in native wet loving flower species, water loving, native water  
**[0:26:44-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:26:44):**  loving flowers and other prairie species so that we're getting native habitat, water conservation,

**[0:26:56-0:27:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:26:56):**  So we're using the water again so it doesn't leave the land.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:27:00):**  It drives me nuts, all this water leaving the land.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:27:02):**  As a little aside, I'm working on a restoration project for a gravel pit in conjunction with

**[0:27:17-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:27:17):**  And at the same time, I fought really hard to conserve this big pit that was in the middle  
**[0:27:22-0:27:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:27:22):**  that's filling with water and it's been abandoned for 30 years.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:27:26):**  So it's full of trees.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:27:27):**  And I'm like, just send the water there.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:27:31):**  Like this is a piece of land that's gonna be completely, earth can be all moved around  
**[0:27:38-0:27:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:27:38):**  anyway.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:27:39):**  So it's not gonna cost any money, like it's all happening anyways.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:27:42):**  But the idea that we have in our land management systems is like always like get rid of water,  
**[0:27:49-0:27:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:27:49):**  drain it, get rid of it, drain it, get rid of it, move it away, move it away.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:27:53):**  And we should be sinking it and storing it and creating places for it so that we can  
**[0:27:58-0:27:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:27:58):**  have it when we need it.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:27:59):**  So and then I guess just to wrap up the irrigation side of things, in terms of vegetables, if  
**[0:28:07-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:28:07):**  it's transplanted, I use drip.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:28:10):**  Because if it's transplanted, the bed can be mulched.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:28:13):**  Mulch helps the production of the vegetable with water conservation already.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:28:20):**  And so if it's mulched, I'm not gonna try to weed it with a mechanized weeding method.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:28:25):**  I'm using mulch as my weeding method.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:28:27):**  So if it's transplanted, it's mulched, if it's mulched, it's drip.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:28:31):**  If it's seeded, it's a micro sprinkler.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:28:35):**  And that's my choices.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:28:37):**  So first soil health, water conservation, multiple sources, you know, like NASA, and  
**[0:28:44-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:28:44):**  then drip for transplants and sprinkler for seeded crops.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:28:48):**  Do you have any recommendations on specific drip irrigation or sprinkler systems?  
**[0:28:54-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:28:54):**  Well, I mean, I think that like the systems are fairly ubiquitous around the world in  
**[0:29:02-0:29:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:29:02):**  terms of like the technology that exists.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:29:04):**  I work with a company out of Quebec here.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:29:06):**  And for the sprinklers, I like something called the XL wobbler.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:29:11):**  It has a softer, like raindrops style.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:29:16):**  Those impact sprinklers aren't great, because they're really hard.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:29:20):**  You can compact your soil with sprinklers, essentially.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:29:23):**  And you can compact the top layer, so then your soil is not able to absorb more water.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:29:28):**  So the ones that mimic rain are better in terms of not over packing it.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:29:35):**  And I guess I would just say again, you know, it's easy to over water and not, you know,  
**[0:29:41-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:29:41):**  because you water and then the soil looks dry again.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:29:45):**  And so it's easy to think that you need to water more than you really need to, you know.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:29:50):**  And this is why it's good to have again, the hedgerows and stuff that that's removing the  
**[0:29:55-0:29:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:29:55):**  issue of just water loss from wind.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:29:58):**  We have quite a windy site.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:30:00):**  So for me, like,  
**[0:30:06-0:30:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:30:06):**  for trees, I love there's a there's a there's a it's kind of like a heavy duty drip tape.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:30:11):**  It's called blue line.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:30:12):**  And it's, you know, it's great.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:30:14):**  It's really heavy duty.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:30:15):**  And honestly, if I was doing a lot of vegetables right now, I probably would go to using the  
**[0:30:21-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:30:21):**  the like, tree, you know, vineyard, like heavy duty drip tape, even for my vegetables, just  
**[0:30:27-0:30:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:30:27):**  because you can you can use it and I'd probably just, you know, shift it into one bed at the  
**[0:30:32-0:30:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:30:32):**  end of the year as like a storage place for it because it wouldn't it won't it won't get  
**[0:30:37-0:30:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:30:37):**  destroyed by mice and stuff like that and you won't have to bother wrapping it up.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:30:41):**  So I like these supplies, but I always try to find solutions where, you know, I'm not  
**[0:30:48-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:30:48):**  having to buy supplies all the time.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:30:51):**  And I like things that are reusable, you know, so  
**[0:30:54-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:30:54):**  Love it.  
**[0:30:55-0:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:30:55):**  Yeah, that's really good information.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:30:58):**  Now, let's switch gears a little bit before I hand it over to our listener questions and  
**[0:31:02-0:31:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:31:02):**  talk a bit about the business side of running a market garden.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:31:05):**  Because like we were discussing before this conversation, that is often the sticking point  
**[0:31:10-0:31:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:31:10):**  or the point of failure for people who have no issue raising the crops themselves and  
**[0:31:15-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:31:15):**  managing the ecosystem for some of us that comes easier than the actual business side.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:31:20):**  So can you talk from your own experience about how you made the profitability of the business  
**[0:31:26-0:31:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:31:26):**  work in all of the dynamics of a living system that you had to manage?  
**[0:31:32-0:31:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:31:32):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:31:34):**  I mean, that's definitely, you know, often that is the fact like, you know, once you  
**[0:31:38-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:31:38):**  once you learn a system and you create your own systems to write, because I truly believe  
**[0:31:43-0:31:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:31:43):**  in model designs that are, you know, adapted and adopted to your situation, we're all,  
**[0:31:48-0:31:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:31:48):**  you know, innovating a system that works for us.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:31:50):**  Once you succeed at finding your rhythm, usually you're right, there's, it's not hard to produce  
**[0:31:56-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:31:56):**  a lot.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:31:57):**  So it's about selling it, it's about not overproducing so that you are failing, but you're only failing  
**[0:32:05-0:32:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:32:05):**  because you're doing so well.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:32:06):**  So growing slowly is really important because, you know, if you end up with an overproduction  
**[0:32:12-0:32:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:32:12):**  of delicata squash, and you can't do anything with it, you know, it costs you a lot of money.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:32:18):**  And even though you're like, you're like a successful grower, because you didn't manage  
**[0:32:23-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:32:23):**  to market it, you feel like you failed and your pocketbook shows that you essentially  
**[0:32:27-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:32:27):**  failed because you have the expense but not the income.

**[0:32:43-0:32:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:32:43):**  It needs, like, you should not be in the summer thinking at all about where your food is going.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:32:51):**  You should absolutely be like, it goes to this many CSA, it goes to this grocery store,  
**[0:32:57-0:33:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:32:57):**  it goes to this wholesale buyer, all of that needs to be determined ahead of time.

**[0:33:48-0:33:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:33:48):**  The other thing what I did too is I tried to really understand specifically what my

**[0:33:56-0:34:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:33:56):**  And I created a model that we use called Guild Enterprise Production.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:34:01):**  So just like you have a guild, say annual vegetables as a, you know, a guild crop, or  
**[0:34:09-0:34:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:34:09):**  a guild of perennials, I created a guild of businesses.

**[0:34:46-0:34:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:34:46):**  I would always bounce it back against my holistic goal and against my Guild Enterprise Production

**[0:35:25-0:35:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:35:25):**  world.

**[0:35:33-0:35:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:35:33):**  making sure that we return to the biodiverse world that we want.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:35:36):**  If it's not profitable, it ain't gonna happen.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:35:38):**  So if we are really focused, what I found is that as I focused on a limiting of what  
**[0:35:47-0:35:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:35:47):**  my production was, I ended up with a more biodiverse farm.  
**[0:35:53-0:35:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:35:53):**  You would think it would be the opposite, but that's not what happened.  
**[0:35:56-0:35:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:35:56):**  Because as I focused, I succeeded.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:35:58):**  And as I succeeded, I integrated diversity into other ways as kind of companionships,  
**[0:36:04-0:36:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:36:04):**  but it was all oriented around the global sphere of enterprise businesses.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:36:11):**  So I think that's really important.  
**[0:36:14-0:36:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:36:14):**  I think those are kind of some big takeaways I could say is that, you know, make sure that  
**[0:36:19-0:36:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:36:19):**  you do your research and you orient yourself in terms of where you're going to sell way

**[0:36:29-0:36:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:36:29):**  you stick to that and you only vary from that if you're really conscious of it.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:36:36):**  It's not that you can't change your businesses or evolve your businesses.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:36:39):**  We all do this.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:36:40):**  This is life.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:36:41):**  It's that we never want to do it just because.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:36:46):**  Another example of that is a tractor or a certain, really define the way you grow.  
**[0:36:57-0:37:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:36:57):**  So don't do it unless you are doing it from a point of view of I'm doing this because  
**[0:37:03-0:37:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:37:03):**  this is my business plan.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:37:06):**  It's really easy to get pulled off on tangents, especially when we get into like emergency  
**[0:37:11-0:37:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:37:11):**  mode in the summer, you know, where you just start throwing, you know, solutions at something  
**[0:37:17-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:37:17):**  that haven't had the time to think them through.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:37:19):**  And then they end up defining the way that you grow later.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:37:22):**  So excellent advice there.  
**[0:37:25-0:37:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:37:25):**  And it's echoed by a lot of the others that have experience in this conference so far  
**[0:37:30-0:37:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:37:30):**  and talking about how in the beginning there was just so much going on.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:37:34):**  And over the years, as they started to become more confident in their business model, it  
**[0:37:39-0:37:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:37:39):**  all started to simplify and they just cut any of the fat that was not absolutely necessary  
**[0:37:44-0:37:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:37:44):**  to keep that business running and to keep their plants healthy.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:37:48):**  I'm going to leave it to the participants now to ask any questions.  
**[0:37:53-0:37:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:37:53):**  And if you want to ask it yourself, just raise the hand so I know who to call on.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:37:59):**  Otherwise you can type it in the chat and I'll read it out for you.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:38:03):**  Whichever person wants to go first.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:38:05):**  All right.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:38:06):**  Well, they're not jumping to talk, but I've got some questions here from before.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:38:11):**  One of which was from Alex about why you would not want to suddenly start irrigating with  
**[0:38:17-0:38:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:38:17):**  well water in the middle of July in your market garden.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:38:21):**  Yeah.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:38:22):**  Well, so I always work from a system of mimicry natural ecosystem.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:38:27):**  So natural ecosystem plants very early in the spring, they would have cold melt water  
**[0:38:36-0:38:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:38:36):**  around them.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:38:38):**  And they've adapted with that.  
**[0:38:41-0:38:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:38:41):**  But in the summertime, in my ecosystems in where I am in temperate North America, there  
**[0:38:48-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:38:48):**  wouldn't be ice cold water or essentially the water that we get from 12 feet below ground  
**[0:38:56-0:39:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:38:56):**  and deeper that wouldn't fall from the sky as cold rain, the rain water is warmer.  
**[0:39:03-0:39:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:39:03):**  So we're wanting to create an irrigation system that is as close as possible is mimicking  
**[0:39:11-0:39:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:39:11):**  a natural watering system.  
**[0:39:16-0:39:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:39:16):**  And so that we don't shock the plants.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:39:17):**  This is also really important in greenhouses.  
**[0:39:20-0:39:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:39:20):**  So in a greenhouse, you often have like a 250 gallon tank as well.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:39:23):**  And water will be put into that tank.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:39:25):**  And then it'll have a jet pump that pumps out of that tank that's used to water the  
**[0:39:30-0:39:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:39:30):**  the transplants.  
**[0:39:34-0:39:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:39:34):**  Okay, can I can I elaborate on my question?  
**[0:39:38-0:39:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:39:38):**  Because I'm wondering, I mean, one one reason why I'm hesitant to to run the water through  
**[0:39:46-0:39:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:39:46):**  a tank is that I don't have I don't have electricity on my side.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:39:51):**  So for that, I would need to use an engine pump, which would create noise and pollution.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:39:57):**  So in the tunnel, it wouldn't be an option for that reason, I would have to have it outside

**[0:40:52-0:40:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:40:52):**  off grid for 15 years.

**[0:40:57-0:41:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:40:57):**  So I did I pumped up to storage tanks on my ridge.  
**[0:41:01-0:41:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:41:01):**  And then I allowed the the gravity to pressurize and I understood exactly how many feet of

**[0:43:13-0:43:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:43:13):**  Sounds sounds good to me.

**[0:43:42-0:43:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:43:42):**  It's it's probably the first time I actually listened to a serious conversation about how  
**[0:43:46-0:43:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:43:46):**  to make perennial based or agroforestry systems work financially.  
**[0:43:52-0:43:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:43:52):**  We put in Portugal, we have quite a dry climate and there's a lot of experiments being done.  
**[0:43:57-0:44:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:43:57):**  But usually, the people behind it don't have actually an experience selling food, you know,  
**[0:44:05-0:44:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:44:05):**  producing and selling.  
**[0:44:06-0:44:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:44:06):**  So that's, it's, it makes all sense.  
**[0:44:09-0:44:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:44:09):**  Everything is said to until now.

**[0:44:15-0:44:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:44:15):**  Yeah, awesome.  
**[0:44:17-0:44:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:44:17):**  Thanks for the question.

**[0:44:26-0:44:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:44:26):**  around here and there.  
**[0:44:27-0:44:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:44:27):**  And there's a part that I do.  
**[0:44:32-0:44:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:44:32):**  All of which is so awesome.

**[0:44:39-0:44:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:44:39):**  Go back.

**[0:44:44-0:44:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:44:44):**  So on a really small scale, you know, a good ergonomic shovel, a broad fork, you know,  
**[0:44:51-0:44:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:44:51):**  ways of bringing in compost, like this is all achievable.  
**[0:44:54-0:45:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:44:54):**  It's about, it's about working with the lines in your landscape that what I call common  
**[0:45:00-0:45:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:45:00):**  lines.

**[0:45:08-0:45:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:45:08):**  And this could be something you have built yourself or fabricated at a welding shop,  
**[0:45:13-0:45:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:45:13):**  where you take you know, a disc from like an old tractor disc set, and you just put  
**[0:45:18-0:45:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:45:18):**  one disc behind each tire, and they're oriented to throw soil into the space between the tires  
**[0:45:25-0:45:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:45:25):**  and that creates your initial bed.

**[0:45:33-0:45:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:45:33):**  the beds quite high.  
**[0:45:35-0:45:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:45:35):**  You can get like 24 inch wide discs, and even doubles of them.  
**[0:45:40-0:45:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:45:40):**  And these can help bed shape and form that that bed as well.  
**[0:45:43-0:45:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:45:43):**  So there's a few different ways on a project that we have been working on in Winnipeg in  
**[0:45:49-0:45:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:45:49):**  in the suburbs, we've done almost a three acre property completely converted to market  
**[0:45:56-0:45:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:45:56):**  garden and food forest.  
**[0:45:59-0:46:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:45:59):**  And that one we did with framing it framing in the permabeds using small square bales,  
**[0:46:05-0:46:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:46:05):**  and then in filling.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:46:06):**  So this is like a hugh culture model for building the permabeds.  
**[0:46:11-0:46:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:46:11):**  So there's multiple ways to approach that.  
**[0:46:15-0:46:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:46:15):**  And I just depends on the scale and the situation and the equipment that is that is used.  
**[0:46:20-0:46:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:46:20):**  So I think we lost our friend there on his drive.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:46:23):**  But that's

**[0:46:26-0:46:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:46:26):**  Luckily, we're recording this, this will go up later.

**[0:46:38-0:46:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:46:38):**  Well, so in in the edible ecosystem solution book, that looks at at starting as small as  
**[0:46:46-0:46:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:46:46):**  25 square feet in terms of design.  
**[0:46:50-0:46:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:46:50):**  And in I still consider this the permabed system, because this is really the design  
**[0:46:56-0:47:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:46:56):**  methodology of creating highly organized systems, highly pattern based systems that are that  
**[0:47:03-0:47:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:47:03):**  are focused on efficiency as the gateway to abundance and edible biodiversity on homes,  
**[0:47:10-0:47:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:47:10):**  homesteads and farms.  
**[0:47:11-0:47:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:47:11):**  So I say you can get as small as 25 square feet in this model, because you can have an  
**[0:47:15-0:47:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:47:15):**  entire ecosystem within 25 square feet.

**[0:47:25-0:47:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:47:25):**  the bed based patterning.  
**[0:47:28-0:47:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:47:28):**  And so, you know, at three beds, at whatever length, you have a triad.  
**[0:47:33-0:47:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:47:33):**  And so you can choose to have, you know, an annual triad that's designed this way or a  
**[0:47:38-0:47:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:47:38):**  perennial triad, or you can have a triad that's blending those two, the moment you get to,  
**[0:47:45-0:47:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:47:45):**  you know, a couple of triads, you know, let's say two triads in annual, and one triad and  
**[0:47:52-0:47:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:47:52):**  perennials, you're really starting to have the beginning of a permaplot.  
**[0:47:58-0:48:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:47:58):**  And again, at whatever length.  
**[0:48:00-0:48:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:48:00):**  So I consider a permabed, you know, if you have if you have a permabed that's just five  
**[0:48:05-0:48:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:48:05):**  feet long, I consider this just a guild spot, that's 25 square feet.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:48:11):**  If you have a permabed that's over 15 feet, then I would consider that a full bed, anything  
**[0:48:17-0:48:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:48:17):**  under 15 feet, I kind of consider it a like a micro landscape, it's a it's a it's a guild  
**[0:48:21-0:48:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:48:21):**  spot, it's a piece of land that's in a guild, it's more landscaping, once you go over 15  
**[0:48:26-0:48:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:48:26):**  feet, you have a real garden bed.  
**[0:48:28-0:48:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:48:28):**  So then, you know, three permabeds at 15 feet, you have a triad, but they could be up to  
**[0:48:33-0:48:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:48:33):**  300 feet.

**[0:48:39-0:48:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:48:39):**  So once you get to having, you know, about 12 beds, you know, you really start to be  
**[0:48:47-0:48:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:48:47):**  on let's say 12 beds by 25 feet or 12 beds by 50 feet, you're really starting to have  
**[0:48:53-0:48:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:48:53):**  the potential to do quite a lot of organized patterning that you might want to see for  
**[0:48:58-0:49:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:48:58):**  a mark like a market garden style.  
**[0:49:02-0:49:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:49:02):**  And then you know, you just go from there, like it can go up to any scale you want.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:49:05):**  So you know, we're doing this on 150 acres right now.  
**[0:49:08-0:49:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:49:08):**  So it's, you know, sky's the limit.  
**[0:49:13-0:49:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:49:13):**  That's awesome.

**[0:49:21-0:49:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:49:21):**  So first of all, great information.  
**[0:49:24-0:49:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:49:24):**  I wanted to ask something about the water management that you mentioned and to ask you  
**[0:49:30-0:49:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:49:30):**  if, if you thought about and have used key line design to capture water, and if not,

**[0:49:41-0:49:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:49:41):**  Yeah.  
**[0:49:42-0:49:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:49:42):**  Um, essentially, what I work with is that the more steep your land is, the more you  
**[0:49:49-0:49:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:49:49):**  want to build your bed on contour.

**[0:49:57-0:50:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:49:57):**  And the more you probably want to lean towards perennials as your dominant production, because  
**[0:50:03-0:50:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:50:03):**  growing annuals on hillsides, you know, is just not as conducive as growing perennials.  
**[0:50:09-0:50:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:50:09):**  So and the, and so the more that my land is more gentle and flat, the more my perma beds  
**[0:50:16-0:50:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:50:16):**  are roughly on contour, but I don't get too nitpicky about it, because I'm creating permanent  
**[0:50:24-0:50:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:50:24):**  beds anyways.

**[0:50:31-0:50:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:50:31):**  as well.

**[0:51:05-0:51:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:51:05):**  diameter by a foot or so deep natural pits.

**[0:51:32-0:51:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:51:32):**  my hillside through a lot of, you know, work and rearranging of the soil.

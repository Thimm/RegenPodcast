**[0:02:30-0:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:02:30):**  We're here with the usual suspects.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:02:31):**  Although Neil is gone this time, he actually just left yesterday with his partner Adriana,  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:02:36):**  and they're off to a much-deserved vacation with his family in Madrid in Spain.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:02:41):**  So good for them.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:02:42):**  They've been slogging it out here with us all through the rainy season and working tirelessly.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:02:47):**  So I'm really hoping that they have a good time, and hopefully we'll get to post some  
**[0:02:51-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:02:51):**  pictures on the Instagram once they start sending them back.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:02:56):**  So everybody has kind of different responsibilities and tasks that they manage here on the farm.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:03:01):**  Adriana was doing a lot of the accounting for the business and also managing the sales  
**[0:03:06-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:03:06):**  of the dairy products, so the milk, yogurt, and different cheeses that we have.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:03:11):**  So they've both passed on their responsibilities.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:03:13):**  Neil's passed some of his projects that he was co-managing with Jeremy, and Adriana has  
**[0:03:19-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:03:19):**  passed them on to Jeremy's partner, Carla.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:03:21):**  So everybody's sort of figuring out each other's roles, but it's really good for having a little  
**[0:03:26-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:03:26):**  bit of redundancy in our processes, right?  
**[0:03:29-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:03:29):**  Yeah, you know, it's both equally exciting and stressful.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:03:36):**  And we know, but we tried to plan as much as possible, especially Adriana and Carla.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:03:41):**  It was a pretty seamless passover.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:03:45):**  So I can see that she's already getting pretty good at managing the accounts.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:03:51):**  I'm impressed.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:03:53):**  And you know, with Neil and my projects, we oftentimes work together on just about anything.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:03:58):**  So it really just means extra workload for us.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:04:01):**  But you know, we need to be able, we need to have this redundancy so that people can  
**[0:04:06-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:04:06):**  take time off.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:04:07):**  It's very important, and I'm happy to facilitate that, you know.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:04:11):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:04:13):**  So let's talk a little bit about some of the new things that have happened, both in the  
**[0:04:16-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:04:16):**  animal systems especially, as well as the focus of the nursery that we've been working  
**[0:04:22-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:04:22):**  on as well.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:04:23):**  So we just added an extension to the goat house.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:04:26):**  Let's talk a little bit about why.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:04:28):**  Yeah, you know, it may not sound that exciting to some people, but for us, it's important  
**[0:04:35-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:04:35):**  because the goats are our moneymaker here in some ways, or at least they provide that  
**[0:04:41-0:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:04:41):**  consistent support that we need to pay the staff basically, and to keep things rolling  
**[0:04:48-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:04:48):**  here.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:04:49):**  And so what that means is more goats.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:04:52):**  And we have to think of inventive ways of amplifying our space a bit without it costing  
**[0:04:59-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:04:59):**  too much.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:05:00):**  Because we don't, you know, we're not pulling in bank here, you know.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:05:05):**  So we got, like usual, people give us things, and what that means is we have to kind of  
**[0:05:12-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:05:12):**  make executive decisions on the spot.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:05:15):**  Our Colombian friend who's going to work in the States needed someone to watch his goats,  
**[0:05:21-0:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:05:21):**  and you know, he was offering to pay us or blah, blah, blah.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:05:25):**  And we're like, and they're all pregnant, and we're like, just give us some of your  
**[0:05:28-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:05:28):**  goats when they give birth, and we're square.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:05:33):**  These kind of trades are perfect because it's really helpful for everyone involved, and  
**[0:05:40-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:05:40):**  we get to have more goats.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:05:42):**  And so by next year, we'll have double the capacity of milk coming out of here.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:05:47):**  And all we had to do to really provide for them was divide one of the enclosures because  
**[0:05:54-0:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:05:54):**  it was just, it was quite big, but it would be like our goats would sit on one side and  
**[0:05:59-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:05:59):**  then the other goats who are honestly scared out of their lives sitting on the other side.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:06:06):**  So all we do is put a division in and the space works, you know, they're both comfortable

**[0:06:13-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:06:13):**  And we even opened up a fenced in area with a door on it for them, for the new goats to  
**[0:06:18-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:06:18):**  go outside and have even more space.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:06:22):**  So we doubled the space in a sense.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:06:24):**  Yeah, the trick with this is that like there may technically still be enough space in the

**[0:06:39-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:06:39):**  Like seven new ones that were looking after, six, yeah.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:06:44):**  When they first came in, they immediately kind of started fighting and jostling for  
**[0:06:48-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:06:48):**  position in hierarchy with the goats that we already had.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:06:52):**  And it makes for a bit of an uncomfortable social situation for them and giving them  
**[0:06:58-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:06:58):**  extra space, especially while they're pregnant, had more to do with just the comfort and not

**[0:07:09-0:07:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:07:09):**  Yeah, in any case, it's tricky deciding on these types of things because they're pretty  
**[0:07:14-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:07:14):**  permanent and, but immediately we saw the results.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:07:19):**  We put in just a simple wall with a door on it inside of the enclosure and it didn't affect  
**[0:07:24-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:07:24):**  our goats at all.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:07:26):**  Like they're totally fine and the new goats were just thrilled.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:07:30):**  They just like, you can see they're just so much happier, they behave better.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:07:35):**  They get to actually bask out in the sun if they want to, which our goats don't, but they  
**[0:07:40-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:07:40):**  also don't seem to notice that they're able to do that.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:07:42):**  So it works out pretty good.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:07:43):**  As well, we can now milk each group separately, which is also huge, that's a very stressful  
**[0:07:49-0:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:07:49):**  time in the day with the goats.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:07:52):**  It's one of those times where they really start to fight for their position in the hierarchy.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:07:57):**  So if you have them separate, you can still milk them in the same spot.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:08:01):**  Like I said before, it's probably not that exciting to some people, but for us it's a

**[0:08:08-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:08:08):**  Also gives the chickens a new area to scratch and they seem to be pretty happy about that.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:08:13):**  Yeah, it's just one of those things that you start to learn as you interact with your living  
**[0:08:18-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:08:18):**  systems.

**[0:08:23-0:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:08:23):**  of the designs for the animal enclosures just kind of had to be amended for the new things  
**[0:08:28-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:08:28):**  that we're observing in their behavior and observations of their level of health and  
**[0:08:33-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:08:33):**  how they interact with one another.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:08:35):**  And it's just one of those things that you have to be paying attention to or else you'll  
**[0:08:38-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:08:38):**  miss because a lot of it's subtle or it doesn't happen all day.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:08:42):**  Just like Jeremy was saying, when it comes to milking time, that's really when they start  
**[0:08:45-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:08:45):**  to kind of jostle for position and they really butt heads literally kind of pushing some  
**[0:08:53-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:08:53):**  of the smaller and weaker ones out into the corner and chasing them around.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:08:57):**  None of them seem to get hurt particularly bad, but it definitely makes it more difficult  
**[0:09:02-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:09:02):**  to wrangle them into their milking positions and it makes the process more stressful than  
**[0:09:08-0:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:09:08):**  it has to be.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:09:09):**  So yeah, like Jeremy was talking about, these types of observations just kind of take some  
**[0:09:13-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:09:13):**  time and as you observe them over a period of time, you can make additions or alterations  
**[0:09:20-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:09:20):**  to the structures to sort of reflect how they're interacting with each other.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:09:25):**  Yeah, it brought to mind for both Neil and I one of the principles, one of the mollisonium  
**[0:09:31-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:09:31):**  principles of permaculture, which is make the greatest effect with the least amount  
**[0:09:36-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:09:36):**  of change.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:09:38):**  How much do you have to alter a system that you have in place for it to work much better?  
**[0:09:43-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:09:43):**  A lot of times it's like either dividing up things or orienting components differently  
**[0:09:49-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:09:49):**  or figuring out new ways that they interact with one another instead of just, what's the  
**[0:09:56-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:09:56):**  expression?  
**[0:09:57-0:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:09:57):**  Taking the baby out with the bathwater.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:09:59):**  Yeah, yeah, don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:10:02):**  Yeah, now that I think about it, it's kind of weird.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:10:04):**  But anyways.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:10:05):**  Yeah, it's a bit of an extreme saying, but I think we all know what we're talking about.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:10:11):**  So what else are we talking about here, Ollie?  
**[0:10:14-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:10:14):**  Well, so we've had to change up the way that we are managing the ducks and the chickens  
**[0:10:18-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:10:18):**  together.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:10:19):**  Now, Jeremy led the adjustments to this and tell me some of the observations that came  
**[0:10:26-0:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:10:26):**  up that made it essential for us to segregate them for the chickens.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:10:30):**  Yeah, a lot of times there's surprises with the animals, I notice.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:10:36):**  The ducks and the chickens were in there together.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:10:38):**  We would separate them after feeding and then we would feed the ducks separately because  
**[0:10:43-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:10:43):**  the chickens are just far more aggressive.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:10:45):**  What we didn't realize until careful observation and one moment, one startling moment was that  
**[0:10:52-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:10:52):**  the chickens were starting to gang up on the ducks and they're doing it at times of the  
**[0:10:57-0:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:10:57):**  day.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:10:58):**  And I didn't really notice, like first thing in the morning, the chickens wake up hungry  
**[0:11:02-0:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:11:02):**  and they just are mean.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:11:03):**  And I didn't notice that they were plucking the feathers out of the ducks so much because  
**[0:11:07-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:11:07):**  they didn't look so bad.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:11:09):**  But then one of the ducks who wasn't so healthy lost some feathers while it was bathing and  
**[0:11:15-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:11:15):**  the chickens started to just go after it.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:11:17):**  They noticed it was weak and they just started to pluck at where the feathers came out.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:11:22):**  And this duck is white and we woke up in the morning and there is blood coming out of the  
**[0:11:25-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:11:25):**  tips of its wings like quite bad.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:11:28):**  And the chickens would just start going at more and more when more blood came out.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:11:31):**  It was kind of nightmarish.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:11:34):**  So we're like, uh-oh, now we got to change things.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:11:36):**  The ducks really need their own space.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:11:40):**  We have six of them and I think that there can be a much more useful part of the system  
**[0:11:47-0:11:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:11:47):**  and then just being penned up there with the chickens anyways.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:11:51):**  So what that meant was that we would experiment a little bit and see what they really liked.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:11:58):**  It works out perfectly in some ways because we have water systems around.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:12:02):**  We have a pond.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:12:03):**  We have these sort of little flooding swales that the water flows out of the pond onto  
**[0:12:09-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:12:09):**  and it would be perfect for ducks.

**[0:12:17-0:12:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:12:17):**  In the pen, they don't really get to eat many greens because the chickens are just far more  
**[0:12:22-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:12:22):**  aggressive.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:12:23):**  They don't really let them get to it.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:12:24):**  So now all of a sudden the ducks can go around and chew back the weeds growing out of the  
**[0:12:29-0:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:12:29):**  rocks on the side and the walls.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:12:32):**  They can go after the weeds growing in the pathways.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:12:34):**  And it's funny, they actually like a lot of these sort of tender weeds growing out than  
**[0:12:39-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:12:39):**  even the crops that were growing.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:12:41):**  It seems so far.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:12:42):**  I mean, we've had them out there for two days now and all I see them doing is just going  
**[0:12:46-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:12:46):**  around the edges sort of cleaning stuff up for us.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:12:48):**  So I'm immediately thrilled.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:12:51):**  The one problem we have though is that we have to put the ducks back into the pen at  
**[0:12:56-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:12:56):**  night.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:12:57):**  What that means is that if we have one laying right now, we'll probably have two soon.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:13:03):**  If they can't lay on their eggs and if they don't have a place where they are all day,  
**[0:13:08-0:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:13:08):**  that means they can't hatch new ducklings, which for us is pretty important because,  
**[0:13:13-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:13:13):**  well, you know, we'll probably be eating them pretty soon.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:13:15):**  So we need to have new ones on the way.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:13:18):**  So that makes things a bit more complicated.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:13:20):**  What that means now is making a new enclosure for them and we got to think about how we  
**[0:13:25-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:13:25):**  can do that most effectively and without taking too much of our valuable time to do it.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:13:31):**  Yeah, it's sort of as you tweak the systems, you notice sort of weak points or difficulties  
**[0:13:39-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:13:39):**  in the way that you have changed it.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:13:41):**  So like this morning I got up a little bit earlier and one of the first things that I  
**[0:13:44-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:13:44):**  saw was that there were feathers all over the place.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:13:48):**  So we were able to get them away from the predation of the chickens.  
**[0:13:53-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:13:53):**  But overnight we had a stray dog get into the fenced off area where the ducks were,  
**[0:14:00-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:14:00):**  where the market garden is and also where the pond is.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:14:03):**  So the ducks were very happy during the day.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:14:06):**  But unfortunately, one of the dogs actually got that same chicken that had the wounds  
**[0:14:12-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:14:12):**  from it from the chickens the other day.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:14:16):**  And yeah, so we ended up losing one.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:14:19):**  And right now it's an issue of figuring out where the dogs are getting in, how we can  
**[0:14:25-0:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:14:25):**  segregate and protect the ducks at night in a way that doesn't move them around too much  
**[0:14:32-0:14:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:14:32):**  so that they can remain sitting on their eggs and actually hatching new ducklings.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:14:36):**  Yeah, the dog situation.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:14:38):**  It was just like another little nightmare happened right there.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:14:43):**  But you know, you got to crack a couple eggs to make an omelet.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:14:46):**  You know what they say.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:14:49):**  Poor little duckling though.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:14:50):**  We lost one.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:14:52):**  But that was the only way to really know because I've had ducks outside before and if they  
**[0:14:56-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:14:56):**  have like a safe little area, they seem to be fine.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:14:59):**  The problem is really we just have a lot of hungry dogs prowling about at night here and  
**[0:15:06-0:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:15:06):**  it's probably not safe to ever expect that our fence line is really going to keep them  
**[0:15:10-0:15:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:15:10):**  out 100%.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:15:12):**  There's always a chance that one will find a way to get in.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:15:15):**  So yeah, that on top of the whole laying situation kind of tells us, all right, we need to figure  
**[0:15:21-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:15:21):**  out some way that we can make an enclosure for the ducks that why not that we can move  
**[0:15:29-0:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:15:29):**  around, right?  
**[0:15:30-0:15:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:15:30):**  Because we don't know how much we want them in our market garden either.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:15:35):**  So we got to think about that as well.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:15:37):**  Yeah, and that's one of the advantages of using those movable enclosures is that you  
**[0:15:42-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:15:42):**  can try them out in a number of different spots.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:15:46):**  The ducks aren't really grazers and they're not nearly as aggressive with the vegetation  
**[0:15:49-0:15:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:15:49):**  as the chickens are.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:15:51):**  So it won't work so much like a chicken tractor in which you have to move them over a pile  
**[0:15:56-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:15:56):**  of earth regularly so that they don't just become forced to eat the types of plants that  
**[0:16:03-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:16:03):**  aren't really healthy for them because they are selective and they'll definitely start  
**[0:16:07-0:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:16:07):**  out eating things that they prefer.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:16:09):**  And if you leave them in one spot without any new options for long enough, they'll start  
**[0:16:13-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:16:13):**  to eat plants that really aren't healthy for them or that they don't like.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:16:17):**  And so with chicken tractors, you have to move them very regularly just so that they  
**[0:16:22-0:16:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:16:22):**  don't eat away all of their better options.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:16:24):**  The ducks are much more looking after like small insects and caterpillars and grubs and  
**[0:16:30-0:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:16:30):**  things like that, as well as more aquatic plants.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:16:34):**  So there's always a risk of having them eat back all of our edible aquatic plants around  
**[0:16:39-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:16:39):**  the pond.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:16:40):**  But just after two days, they don't seem to be too aggressive towards that and they're  
**[0:16:44-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:16:44):**  still eating some of the cracked fermented corn that we give them as well.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:16:48):**  So it'll be interesting to observe this as we continue to try out different solutions.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:16:53):**  And I think, yeah, the next step is going to be coming up with a small movable enclosure  
**[0:16:58-0:17:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:16:58):**  so that they'll be safe overnight, but that we can try it out in a few different places  
**[0:17:02-0:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:17:02):**  and see where they interact best with the systems that we have.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:17:06):**  So let's switch gears again a little bit and talk more about the nursery that has been  
**[0:17:10-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:17:10):**  planted over the last almost two months now.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:17:13):**  Jared, can you talk to us a little bit about how we're finding a balance between native  
**[0:17:18-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:17:18):**  species and heirloom varieties that do really well here and sort of the larger demand from  
**[0:17:24-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:17:24):**  the landscaping job clients that we have and what their needs are?  
**[0:17:29-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:17:29):**  Yeah, so it's, you know, it's kind of a tricky situation when we start talking about natives  
**[0:17:35-0:17:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:17:35):**  here.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:17:36):**  But what we've realized is that most of the natives that are like, you know, authentic  
**[0:17:45-0:17:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:17:45):**  to this area as opposed to ones that have been introduced in the last hundred years,  
**[0:17:50-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:17:50):**  is that a lot of them are canopy species.  
**[0:17:55-0:18:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:17:55):**  I think that that's an important thing to keep in mind because the rest of the species  
**[0:18:00-0:18:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:18:00):**  we use we'll consider more opportunistic or like forest edge species.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:18:05):**  And that's also where we see the change in terms of introduction of plants is that the  
**[0:18:10-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:18:10):**  opportunistic species that are introduced oftentimes occupy that niche on the edge of

**[0:18:18-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:18:18):**  And so we can kind of work with that, you know, especially considering that our clients  
**[0:18:24-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:18:24):**  are also interested in a lot of these species that have been introduced.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:18:28):**  A lot of the medicinal and culinary herbs are, you know, either European, well, European  
**[0:18:35-0:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:18:35):**  stock and then brought over and sort of being conditioned to this environment in a lot of  
**[0:18:40-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:18:40):**  ways.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:18:42):**  And as well as our veggies, I mean, everyone here eats veggies that either came from the  
**[0:18:47-0:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:18:47):**  new world and went to the old world and came back or from the old world.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:18:52):**  And we're all using here.  
**[0:18:55-0:19:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:18:55):**  So the way I look at it is I think that we can work as a stable late succession model,  
**[0:19:03-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:19:03):**  work with trees that are native to here, bring those back in.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:19:06):**  But in the interim, you know, we try to take advantage of working on environments that  
**[0:19:12-0:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:19:12):**  are exposed and, you know, people really want to pay attention to to grow whatever species  
**[0:19:18-0:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:19:18):**  they want, in my opinion.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:19:20):**  And so working in our zone four, try to maintain this kind of native species canopy and try  
**[0:19:26-0:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:19:26):**  to attract and that attracts a lot of the fauna that are native to here as well.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:19:32):**  And so if we keep that in mind with a lot of our projects, reforesting, things like  
**[0:19:37-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:19:37):**  that, we can kind of hold true to the ethics that we want to in terms of those projects,  
**[0:19:44-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:19:44):**  which we have one coming up in a couple of weeks.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:19:46):**  We have a retreat coming in and they like they have a karma yoga duty that comes along  
**[0:19:52-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:19:52):**  with their course.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:19:54):**  And they have asked us to put together a reforestation project for them.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:19:59):**  So that simply means is we start planting avocado trees that are endemic stock to this  
**[0:20:05-0:20:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:20:05):**  area.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:20:06):**  We're planting some of these nitrogen fixing species that accompany them really nice that  
**[0:20:10-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:20:10):**  are also native to this area.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:20:13):**  And then working on whatever species we can find that kind of like just show up a lot  
**[0:20:18-0:20:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:20:18):**  of times and that we can work into the system.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:20:20):**  There's a lot of volunteer species once you start adding water and you can create a whole  
**[0:20:25-0:20:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:20:25):**  basically just see what does well and works with the system.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:20:29):**  This kind of thing also works great for our goats because we plant areas around our neighbors.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:20:34):**  Basically, we give them new fruit trees.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:20:36):**  We give them these hardwood species that you can cut for firewood at times.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:20:43):**  And then we maintenance it by basically going out and cutting the fodder for our goats.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:20:48):**  And we were talking to our neighbor yesterday and I was like, is it OK if we clean your  
**[0:20:52-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:20:52):**  coffee zone where we're planting the trees when there's like weeds that grow up?  
**[0:20:56-0:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:20:56):**  And he's like, yeah, please.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:20:58):**  That would be awesome.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:21:00):**  Thank you.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:21:01):**  Great, you guys are going to plant fruit trees and firewood species and you're going to clean  
**[0:21:07-0:21:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:21:07):**  it for us and water it?  
**[0:21:09-0:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:21:09):**  Why would they say no?  
**[0:21:11-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:21:11):**  What this also did for us, I'll just wrap up this little story here, was also get us  
**[0:21:16-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:21:16):**  a contact for coffee.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:21:17):**  So we have a beneficial that we're almost done with.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:21:21):**  It's where we depulp coffee and sell it to our neighbor after it's been dried.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:21:26):**  He roasts it and sells it nationally to expats and to even to locals and anyone really that  
**[0:21:33-0:21:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:21:33):**  wants it here.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:21:35):**  And so working with our neighbors, trying to rehabilitate their canopy species means  
**[0:21:42-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:21:42):**  that we'll also be in connection for buying the coffee from them at a better price than  
**[0:21:47-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:21:47):**  what it already is, because we know that the quality will only get better as we help them  
**[0:21:51-0:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:21:51):**  with their their coffee fields here.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:21:54):**  Yeah, and if anybody is interested in knowing more about what we're doing with this coffee  
**[0:21:58-0:22:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:21:58):**  processing plant, it's a pretty small and simple operation.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:22:02):**  We've had the facility and the machine donated by our friend and neighbor, Tim Rare.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:22:09):**  If anybody remembers from a previous regenerative roundtable where Neil and I actually interviewed  
**[0:22:14-0:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:22:14):**  him, talked a little bit about how coffee started to become a commodity in this area  
**[0:22:19-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:22:19):**  of the world, even though it's originally from the eastern horn of Africa and Ethiopia  
**[0:22:24-0:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:22:24):**  region.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:22:26):**  It's a fantastic talk and Tim really knows his stuff.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:22:29):**  He walks us through the entire process of picking all the way to processing and final  
**[0:22:35-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:22:35):**  roasting of the beans.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:22:36):**  So if you want to look back on that, I believe it's regenerative roundtable seven, but you  
**[0:22:40-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:22:40):**  can find it by just doing a search for the regenerative roundtables with coffee.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:22:46):**  And yeah, so over it's been about a week and a half now since the masons have come by and  
**[0:22:51-0:22:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:22:51):**  started to build out the design that I worked on with Tim.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:22:54):**  And we're nearly finished, which is perfect because a lot of our own coffee here on site  
**[0:22:58-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:22:58):**  is starting to ripen.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:23:00):**  And I'm really excited to see not only the quality of coffee that we can help to produce  
**[0:23:05-0:23:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:23:05):**  and the better prices that we can offer to our neighbors who would otherwise sell it  
**[0:23:09-0:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:23:09):**  for a price that I mean, this year is barely worth even bothering to harvest.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:23:14):**  And if we can help to engage growers to continue to improve their production methods, then  
**[0:23:22-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:23:22):**  they can continue to get higher prices.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:23:25):**  Tim can continue to produce higher end coffee and everybody sort of wins.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:23:31):**  The nice thing for our site here is that we get to keep a lot of the fertility.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:23:36):**  So the depulping process puts out a very sort of sugar rich and nutrient dense pulp that  
**[0:23:45-0:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:23:45):**  we then process first through what they call Lombri compost.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:23:50):**  Lombrisas are worms and we've got our red regulars already reproducing.  
**[0:23:56-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:23:56):**  So they'll process a lot of this coffee pulp before we introduce it to the larger composting  
**[0:24:01-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:24:01):**  system that we have in the goat pen where each successive unload of material goes down  
**[0:24:08-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:24:08):**  into different chambers where it gets tossed, it gets picked through by the chickens and  
**[0:24:13-0:24:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:24:13):**  sometimes by the ducks.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:24:15):**  And as it goes down to later stages, it gets aerated more.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:24:18):**  And then finally we sift it into the high value compost that we propagate plants in  
**[0:24:24-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:24:24):**  and that we sell to clients and use on our own market garden.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:24:27):**  So really we're using as many of the products as possible, even the waste products that  
**[0:24:32-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:24:32):**  normally otherwise just get chucked away.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:24:35):**  Yeah, you guys kind of just went through the ringer with us there.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:24:39):**  We tried talking about the nursery and somehow we got all the way back to it again, but beforehand  
**[0:24:45-0:24:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:24:45):**  talking about every other thing going on.

**[0:24:51-0:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:24:51):**  So you really can't talk about one subject here without going through paragraphs of looking  
**[0:24:58-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:24:58):**  at every other aspect of it.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:25:00):**  But that's really what it's all about.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:25:02):**  We can't waste any time on a single outcome kind of process here.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:25:09):**  We need to see how it feeds in.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:25:13):**  And it works really well.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:25:14):**  I mean, it's the only way we can really effectively use our time.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:25:20):**  So I'm happy to run the nursery and just kind of be in charge of that because it's one of  
**[0:25:26-0:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:25:26):**  the main kind of outcomes of a lot of this stuff is having plants available.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:25:32):**  When we talk to people and we tell them what plants we have available for them to buy right  
**[0:25:37-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:25:37):**  away, their eyes light up and they're like, oh my God, finally someone's doing this.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:25:43):**  So it's great for us because we have our own plants.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:25:46):**  But I think being able and we oftentimes will go and install the plants for people too and  
**[0:25:53-0:25:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:25:53):**  just seeing a whole landscape full of food at the end of a day ready to produce stuff  
**[0:25:59-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:25:59):**  for people is great.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:26:01):**  And being a catch all service is really kind of fulfilling for me in a sense as opposed  
**[0:26:07-0:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:26:07):**  to just building a terrace and then saying good luck with that.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:26:12):**  We can actually just we can see the whole thing fill out in front of our eyes.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:26:17):**  So that's why I'm into it.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:26:19):**  Well, so along those lines, Jar, tell me a little bit about the Intro to Permaculture  
**[0:26:24-0:26:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:26:24):**  course that you got and Neil just finished up with a few other facilitators.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:26:27):**  I wasn't able to participate as much as I would have liked to because I was sort of  
**[0:26:30-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:26:30):**  finishing up the detail work on the Hobbit House I was building for a friend and neighbors  
**[0:26:35-0:26:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:26:35):**  down the hill.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:26:36):**  But tell me a little bit about what you covered in that course and the practicals that you  
**[0:26:40-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:26:40):**  did here on the farm as well.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:26:42):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:26:43):**  So I was involved more in the practicals on this one, which was worked out in a way because  
**[0:26:49-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:26:49):**  I was able to like hold down the fort.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:26:53):**  You know, there's so many things going on.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:26:54):**  I was just getting the nursery started and we finally have like a nice stock sitting.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:26:59):**  So I was kind of focused on that.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:27:02):**  But when the groups came in here, basically, I gave them a practical on Earthworks, which  
**[0:27:10-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:27:10):**  was great that I was able to focus in on it because I could really kind of land home some  
**[0:27:15-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:27:15):**  very important sort of underlying patterns to design for the students.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:27:22):**  And it's something I'm very passionate about and I think I was able to really get that  
**[0:27:25-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:27:25):**  across for them.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:27:27):**  What we find oftentimes when we teach these courses at Earthworks, people don't really  
**[0:27:33-0:27:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:27:33):**  get what it means for the design to really like think this phase through.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:27:39):**  So I just like hammered them with it for hours.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:27:42):**  It's like and you know, you see people start to really get it and they get impassioned  
**[0:27:47-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:27:47):**  by it.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:27:48):**  And it's just only gonna make better designers in my opinion.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:27:53):**  And it's like it's the one step that I really focused on when I do design work is like,  
**[0:27:59-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:27:59):**  how is the landscape going to be like formed before anything else goes on to it, you know?  
**[0:28:06-0:28:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:28:06):**  And it's amazing because it can really just like show you, teach you how the rest of the  
**[0:28:12-0:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:28:12):**  aspects of the design will come through.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:28:14):**  It kind of just tells you after you start working on it.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:28:17):**  And we got to do a whole contour terrace on the bottom parcel of the land with them.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:28:24):**  And you know, we marked it out and we started carving it out.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:28:28):**  I said, all right guys, like, you know, what does this mean for the landscape?  
**[0:28:31-0:28:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:28:31):**  And we started to realize that like there's different places where water could be stored  
**[0:28:36-0:28:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:28:36):**  that would make sense.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:28:38):**  Some of the areas opened up more and they could be an area for a structure, you know,  
**[0:28:42-0:28:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:28:42):**  and the whole landscape started to come together before our eyes.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:28:46):**  And I don't know, I found it to be a really good course.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:28:51):**  Everyone came away very excited.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:28:53):**  And yeah, I'm excited to do more.  
**[0:28:56-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:28:56):**  We got a couple more coming up here soon.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:28:59):**  And I think it's only going to get better as the high season progresses.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:29:03):**  I know one of the practicals that you guys also worked on was double digging the beds  
**[0:29:07-0:29:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:29:07):**  in the garden.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:29:08):**  Can you talk a little bit about why that's so important in our context with the type  
**[0:29:11-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:29:11):**  of soil that we have?  
**[0:29:13-0:29:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:29:13):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:29:14):**  So that's the other empowering, one of the other empowering practicals that we do with  
**[0:29:19-0:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:29:19):**  the students.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:29:21):**  Another thing that we don't really get to get into much is a lot of the fine-tuned techniques  
**[0:29:26-0:29:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:29:26):**  for gardening that you can employ.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:29:29):**  And it's one of the things that people come into it wanting to get out because it's really  
**[0:29:33-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:29:33):**  applicable to anyone how to grow food, you know, and quickly too.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:29:38):**  So we try to focus our sort of cultivation of the soil in very like intense and kind  
**[0:29:48-0:29:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:29:48):**  of condensed areas.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:29:49):**  So what that means is we just provide every comfort and luxury that our soil will need  
**[0:29:56-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:29:56):**  to give us good food.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:29:57):**  One of those things is filtering the soil a bit and putting it back into the bed that  
**[0:30:04-0:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:30:04):**  we're growing stuff in over some semi-broken down compost, mostly carbon material with  
**[0:30:12-0:30:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:30:12):**  a lot of kind of like still kind of poopy stuff hanging around it.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:30:18):**  So yeah, we basically dig out the bed for this double dig technique.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:30:21):**  We dig out the bed, we put in the sort of semi-raw compost because it doesn't need to  
**[0:30:28-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:30:28):**  be perfectly broken down.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:30:29):**  And I'll explain in a minute why.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:30:31):**  And we start to add some lime to it or magnesium to help it break down a bit, give it some  
**[0:30:38-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:30:38):**  structure and we add all the soil on top of it with some finely broken down compost.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:30:45):**  So the reason why we put all the stuff at the bottom of it is that the plants don't  
**[0:30:48-0:30:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:30:48):**  access it right away.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:30:50):**  But what it is is sort of a fuel source or food for the microbial community that we're  
**[0:30:55-0:30:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:30:55):**  creating.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:30:57):**  The worms really love this sort of like semi-broken down sloppy stuff because it's loaded with

**[0:31:05-0:31:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:31:05):**  And once you get it under the soil there, it starts breaking down quite quickly because  
**[0:31:08-0:31:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:31:08):**  there's so many things looking for food in the soil, all sorts of bugs and stuff.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:31:13):**  But the important one is the worms because they will consume all these bacterias and  
**[0:31:18-0:31:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:31:18):**  just start turning it into castings immediately and also giving the soil a thing we call tilth,  
**[0:31:25-0:31:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:31:25):**  which is what you get after you cultivate the soil.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:31:27):**  But shortly thereafter disappears as rain and other conditions start to compact the  
**[0:31:35-0:31:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:31:35):**  soil again.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:31:36):**  The worms stop that from, the worms stop that compaction phase.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:31:40):**  They keep it in this sort of rich, spongy, aerated form that we really need for our plants.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:31:47):**  So by the time the plants have grown through this topsoil layer, we put in the soil down  
**[0:31:51-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:31:51):**  or the organic matter down beneath is perfectly ready for them to start tapping into.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:31:57):**  And so we kind of like don't have to worry.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:32:02):**  We put a lot of work in right away, but then we can kind of just watch it grow for a long  
**[0:32:06-0:32:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:32:06):**  time because there's so many resources there down beneath and the soil is so well conditioned  
**[0:32:12-0:32:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:32:12):**  to be healthy.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:32:13):**  And we probably won't have to till it for years as well because of this whole factor.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:32:19):**  So that's kind of the idea behind our double dig beds.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:32:24):**  It's permaculture.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:32:25):**  Yeah.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:32:26):**  And moving towards a system which we no longer have to till, the no-till method allows the  
**[0:32:32-0:32:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:32:32):**  microbial life down below to be undisturbed.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:32:36):**  And sometimes what happens is immediately when you till, you get a big flush of bacteria  
**[0:32:40-0:32:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:32:40):**  because it's suddenly oxygenated.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:32:43):**  And that's all great, but then you also have a die off very shortly after.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:32:47):**  And like Jeremy was talking about, we also inoculated with EM's that we brew here on  
**[0:32:51-0:32:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:32:51):**  site just charges it with a ton of microbial life.  
**[0:32:55-0:33:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:32:55):**  And there's plenty of nutrition at multiple levels.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:33:00):**  Another reason why it was really important for us is that we're in extremely rocky soil.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:33:04):**  Basically our entire acre that we have here a little less is a boulder field, which we  
**[0:33:09-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:33:09):**  are trying to grow plants in.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:33:10):**  And so that requires a lot of conditioning of the soil to get the nutrient matter in  
**[0:33:14-0:33:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:33:14):**  there and the life that's necessary to cultivate the amount of annuals that we're putting in  
**[0:33:20-0:33:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:33:20):**  our market garden.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:33:22):**  Now almost all the rest of the site is going to be focused more on perennials, but for  
**[0:33:27-0:33:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:33:27):**  some of our own veggie needs and yeah, just as far as like popular plants to sell vegetables  
**[0:33:35-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:33:35):**  and stuff to sell here, annuals are the easiest for turnover and for profit.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:33:41):**  And we're showing a lot of demonstrations about what you can do with a small piece of  
**[0:33:45-0:33:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:33:45):**  land.  
**[0:33:46-0:33:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:33:46):**  So though it's only a small portion of this parcel here that's dedicated to annuals, it  
**[0:33:51-0:33:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:33:51):**  does need to be sort of babied given the amount of rocks that we have on site.  
**[0:33:56-0:34:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:33:56):**  So little by little with this double dig method and being able now to leave it and just sort  
**[0:34:02-0:34:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:34:02):**  of top dress it with more nutrition and compost, I think that's about as good as we can do  
**[0:34:06-0:34:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:34:06):**  here on this site.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:34:08):**  Yeah, and I'm glad you brought up the rocks because that is a big portion of the project.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:34:15):**  We tend to have 40 to 50% rock in the mass of the soil or pebbles, rocks, etc.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:34:22):**  Anything bigger than like a couple of centimeters, we generally take out.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:34:28):**  Sometimes we leave some of that stuff in there, but what it means is we have a massive byproduct  
**[0:34:33-0:34:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:34:33):**  of gravel and small rocks, right?  
**[0:34:35-0:34:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:34:35):**  So we got to figure out what do we do with all this stuff.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:34:38):**  So we end up making these, we dig out trenches and we put them in for pathways so that water  
**[0:34:43-0:34:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:34:43):**  doesn't build up where we step along.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:34:47):**  But we're like, we still have too many.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:34:49):**  So we're trying to think of different ways we can use them and rocks are great for drainage,  
**[0:34:54-0:34:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:34:54):**  but they are also considered a mulch layer if you have them and if you have enough of  
**[0:34:59-0:35:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:34:59):**  them.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:35:00):**  So we've been sort of testing out these rock mulch borders or I don't know, I just made  
**[0:35:06-0:35:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:35:06):**  that up.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:35:07):**  But the idea is basically you make terrace walls out of rocks along the edges of your  
**[0:35:13-0:35:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:35:13):**  parcels.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:35:15):**  That's where a lot of your perennial plants are and it's also where a lot of weeds grow  
**[0:35:19-0:35:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:35:19):**  and you don't feel like picking them.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:35:22):**  So we'll pile up rocks along these edges.  
**[0:35:25-0:35:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:35:25):**  We'll even fill in whole areas with rocks and gravel and before we do that, we actually  
**[0:35:31-0:35:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:35:31):**  plant into those areas.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:35:33):**  Oftentimes the rocks create a massive kind of mulch layer above the plant that actually  
**[0:35:39-0:35:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:35:39):**  doesn't get too wet, but it also doesn't get too dry.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:35:43):**  So it's sort of a, what's the word I'm thinking of?  
**[0:35:47-0:35:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:35:47):**  It's like well-draining.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:35:49):**  Well, what it does is it moderates the temperature for the roots of the plant.  
**[0:35:54-0:35:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:35:54):**  So during the day when it gets really hot, the heat doesn't penetrate the rocks so much,  
**[0:35:58-0:36:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:35:58):**  they kind of absorb a lot of it.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:36:01):**  And then overnight as they cool down, moisture condenses on the rocks themselves.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:36:05):**  So it actually is a great way to catch energy, yeah, to catch extra humidity overnight for  
**[0:36:12-0:36:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:36:12):**  the plants.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:36:13):**  And on top of that, we don't have to weed those areas.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:36:16):**  And we're actually seeing a lot of plants really, really like this and it's a superior  
**[0:36:21-0:36:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:36:21):**  sort of soil cap to a lot of other materials because it doesn't break down as well.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:36:27):**  So that was a great little kind of aha moment and I think we'll start to use all this extra  
**[0:36:33-0:36:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:36:33):**  rubble kicking around for the rest of the parcels that we're working on on the edges  
**[0:36:38-0:36:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:36:38):**  basically.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:36:39):**  Oh yeah, geez, I just keep talking here.  
**[0:36:42-0:36:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:36:42):**  Ali, why don't you tell us about your natural building course, the first one of the season,  
**[0:36:47-0:36:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:36:47):**  correct?  
**[0:36:48-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:36:48):**  How did that go?  
**[0:36:49-0:36:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:36:49):**  Yeah, thanks.  
**[0:36:50-0:36:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:36:50):**  It was awesome.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:36:51):**  So I'm following up the intro to natural or sorry, the intro to natural building always  
**[0:36:54-0:37:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:36:54):**  follows up the intro to permaculture and they pair together really well because you first  
**[0:37:00-0:37:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:37:00):**  get to understand a lot about ecology and how to interact in a healthy way with ecosystems.

**[0:37:11-0:37:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:37:11):**  that you have on any given site.  
**[0:37:13-0:37:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:37:13):**  So that better understanding of ecology then better informs how you're going to design  
**[0:37:17-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:37:17):**  the built world as well.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:37:19):**  And a lot of the students from the intro to permaculture course sort of hit the ground  
**[0:37:24-0:37:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:37:24):**  running when they came over to the natural building one with their new understanding  
**[0:37:28-0:37:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:37:28):**  of the ecology, especially of this site.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:37:31):**  So we actually, I completely overhauled the course for this season and we're trying out  
**[0:37:36-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:37:36):**  a lot of new things.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:37:37):**  So we got to do a test wall for rammed earth, one for light straw clay as well.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:37:44):**  And to be honest, this was the very first time I've even tried rammed earth and it went  
**[0:37:48-0:37:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:37:48):**  swimmingly, like we put together the forms really well.  
**[0:37:53-0:37:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:37:53):**  And in fact, we've got some videos and some pictures that I'll post.  
**[0:37:56-0:38:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:37:56):**  And that's actually, it's the cover picture of last week's podcast because I went through  
**[0:38:02-0:38:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:38:02):**  the intro to design and siting as the episode of last week.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:38:06):**  So if anybody's interested in kind of seeing some of the content that we cover on the course,  
**[0:38:11-0:38:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:38:11):**  you can hear that first lecture from day one and download an accompanying PDF to go along  
**[0:38:16-0:38:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:38:16):**  with it.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:38:18):**  We did some work on the house here as well because we're starting to go into some of  
**[0:38:21-0:38:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:38:21):**  the finished work and add on some of the last essential features to make this a really comfortable  
**[0:38:26-0:38:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:38:26):**  living area.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:38:28):**  Now that we're all moved into the house, we just need to get better bathrooms.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:38:32):**  We've been using one composting toilet out on the side of the house during this entire  
**[0:38:37-0:38:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:38:37):**  time.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:38:38):**  And quite frankly, it serves really well, but we're thinking of moving it to a different  
**[0:38:41-0:38:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:38:41):**  part of the property, more for the workers and for the volunteers to use because we've  
**[0:38:45-0:38:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:38:45):**  got space behind the house, which we're now converting into private bathrooms.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:38:50):**  And so we're going to do some extra framing for the walls there and fill those in with  
**[0:38:55-0:38:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:38:55):**  the Bahareke technique, which is more commonly known in English as wattle and daub, which  
**[0:38:59-0:39:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:38:59):**  is what the rest of our house is built out of as well.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:39:02):**  So we did some framing there.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:39:04):**  We strapped it up with what they call sintas or fajitas, strips of bamboo that act as the  
**[0:39:10-0:39:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:39:10):**  wattle to hold in the earth and elements of the wall system.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:39:13):**  And we also did a lot of plastering, especially the base coat layer or brown coat, sometimes  
**[0:39:21-0:39:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:39:21):**  also referred to as a scratch coat on the outside of the building.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:39:24):**  So since that course, we've actually hit the ground running because Neil's room is unoccupied  
**[0:39:29-0:39:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:39:29):**  for the week and a half that he's away on vacation.  
**[0:39:32-0:39:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:39:32):**  We've started to do the base coat on the walls in his upper floor.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:39:36):**  So his place is really coming along now because he's got his windows, he's got the base coat  
**[0:39:39-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:39:39):**  plaster in there.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:39:41):**  And not only does it help to reduce the powdering and the cracking that's coming off of the  
**[0:39:46-0:39:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:39:46):**  unfinished walls, but it's also hopefully going to do a lot for the privacy there because  
**[0:39:50-0:39:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:39:50):**  we do have some cracks and separations just from normal shrinkage in the clay that we've  
**[0:39:57-0:39:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:39:57):**  put in the walls.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:39:59):**  But those openings are kind of reducing the privacy that we have.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:40:02):**  And you can hear pretty clearly in between the rooms.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:40:05):**  So I'm hoping that this is going to be a big step up for all of us just as far as comfort  
**[0:40:09-0:40:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:40:09):**  and privacy goes and plastering is just one of my favorite tasks in natural building.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:40:15):**  So we've got our team here.  
**[0:40:16-0:40:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:40:16):**  We've got Nico, Miguel and Ricardo, though, all jumping in and I'm showing them leveling  
**[0:40:21-0:40:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:40:21):**  techniques with the wooden trowels as well.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:40:23):**  So after you put that first coat on, then you get it really nice and level, even though  
**[0:40:27-0:40:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:40:27):**  it roughs up the surface.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:40:29):**  And then pretty soon we'll start going on to the final coat, which I was finally able  
**[0:40:34-0:40:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:40:34):**  to find a source of kale and clay here in the country that they mined directly from  
**[0:40:39-0:40:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:40:39):**  here.  
**[0:40:40-0:40:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:40:40):**  So though it is a little bit of an industrial process to acquire the clay, it's a really,  
**[0:40:44-0:40:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:40:44):**  really nice quality, pure white, very low cracking for the shrinkage that happens with  
**[0:40:50-0:40:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:40:50):**  the clay.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:40:51):**  And we've got different types of sand right here in our valley that we know to source  
**[0:40:57-0:40:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:40:57):**  from and can get it sifted.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:40:59):**  So a lot of those materials are already ready to go and we can make really nice finished  
**[0:41:03-0:41:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:41:03):**  plasters from them, which I've actually been testing out on that hobbit house that is coming  
**[0:41:07-0:41:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:41:07):**  to a close at our neighbor's place down lower in the valley.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:41:12):**  So yeah, a lot of fun stuff going on here with all those new things that we got to try  
**[0:41:16-0:41:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:41:16):**  out in the natural building course.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:41:18):**  I think this next round that will be happening in December is going to be really fun.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:41:23):**  So if anybody's interested in jumping in on those and wants to come out here and help  
**[0:41:27-0:41:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:41:27):**  us do some work and learn a lot in the process, just look for us under the courses page in  
**[0:41:33-0:41:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:41:33):**  the tab on our website at abundantedge.com.

**[0:41:40-0:41:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:41:40):**  So if you want to keep following us in the progress of our demonstration farm, which

**[0:42:27-0:42:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:42:27):**  plans.

**[0:42:31-0:42:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-animal-pens-native-plant-nursery-and-teaching-at-the-farm-rrt-10/#t=0:42:31):**  If you just want to come in and see what we're doing, we offer farm tours on Fridays that

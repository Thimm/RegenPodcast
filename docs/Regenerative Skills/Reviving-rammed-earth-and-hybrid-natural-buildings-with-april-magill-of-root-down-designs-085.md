**[0:06:16-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:06:16):**  Out of all of the options that there are for earthen building, what made you focus mostly  
**[0:06:20-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:06:20):**  on those?  
**[0:06:21-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:06:21):**  Yeah, so after attending some of my first workshops and really kind of entering into  
**[0:06:33-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:06:33):**  that self-education process of what natural building is and all the different methods  
**[0:06:42-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:06:42):**  and I came back to where I live in the southeast of the United States kind of wondering the  
**[0:06:48-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:06:48):**  same thing, okay, well what methods are the most appropriate for this region, which methods  
**[0:06:55-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:06:55):**  are going to be most accepted by people in this region and so the problems that we have,  
**[0:07:06-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:07:06):**  the major problems that we have in my climate region is water and moisture based, so rot,  
**[0:07:15-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:07:15):**  termites, mold issues, these are the common issues and so I felt more compelled to work  
**[0:07:23-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:07:23):**  with mass systems.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:07:26):**  So looking at some of the heavier mass wall systems versus like straw bale and some of  
**[0:07:34-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:07:34):**  the straw heavy systems, straw made me a little uncomfortable in our super wet humid region  
**[0:07:41-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:07:41):**  here and I felt that people are going to naturally be a little bit weary of any heavy straw based  
**[0:07:51-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:07:51):**  systems but then the major turning point for me was in my research, I came across 200 year  
**[0:08:02-0:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:08:02):**  old rammed earth structures in South Carolina and so that was major turning point for me  
**[0:08:08-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:08:08):**  and I thought well we have a local regional history of this method and I began to dig  
**[0:08:16-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:08:16):**  more and I found that there were periods in the past where rammed earth was quite popular  
**[0:08:22-0:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:08:22):**  in different parts of the southeast including Alabama and other southeast states where the  
**[0:08:32-0:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:08:32):**  climate is very wet, very hot and humid and so I felt that if rammed earth was used 200  
**[0:08:41-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:08:41):**  years ago, we have these buildings that are still standing today and they're in really  
**[0:08:45-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:08:45):**  great shape and they were not reinforced, they were not, there was no soil testing,  
**[0:08:51-0:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:08:51):**  there was no engineering, very, very primitive basic rammed earth structures and they're

**[0:09:05-0:09:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:09:05):**  earth and from there the compressed earth block really is I think a method that is more  
**[0:09:16-0:09:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:09:16):**  accessible and available to more people just because of the simplicity of building with  
**[0:09:23-0:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:09:23):**  blocks instead of having to deal with form work and having to have the some carpentry  
**[0:09:30-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:09:30):**  skills. So that is the major reason is really because of the history that I found with the  
**[0:09:41-0:09:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:09:41):**  rammed earth.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:09:42):**  Now you mentioned that there's all these challenges in your region especially due to  
**[0:09:46-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:09:46):**  moisture, humidity and termites specifically. Now I know that there's not any organic  
**[0:09:54-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:09:54):**  material in rammed earth or compressed earthen blocks so that gets rid of the risk of termites  
**[0:10:00-0:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:10:00):**  off the bat. How does the clay structure and the makeup of your wall systems help to address  
**[0:10:07-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:10:07):**  the moisture issues?  
**[0:10:11-0:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:10:11):**  So I think like any good building should be detailed, we want to keep the earthen walls  
**[0:10:22-0:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:10:22):**  off of the ground and out of any kind of flood activity and of course good roof covering  
**[0:10:32-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:10:32):**  so we're always going to strive to protect the walls as much as possible from moisture  
**[0:10:38-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:10:38):**  but with the ability of the clay to take on a pretty substantial amount of moisture and  
**[0:10:46-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:10:46):**  then release it unlike wood or any cellulose kind of based material. Just that the breathable  
**[0:10:59-0:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:10:59):**  nature of earthen materials for me was really reassuring and one of the biggest questions  
**[0:11:14-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:11:14):**  I get all the time from people when I'm talking or teaching or whatever is they think  
**[0:11:22-0:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:11:22):**  that the walls are going to melt. Their misconception is that if the wall gets rammed on or if it  
**[0:11:31-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:11:31):**  gets wet it's going to just deteriorate and melt away but as we know if it's built correctly  
**[0:11:42-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:11:42):**  with the right composition of materials and the right compaction and proper detailing  
**[0:11:48-0:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:11:48):**  you can – I mean these walls are close to being like stone when they're done and once  
**[0:11:56-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:11:56):**  people see it and they feel it and they go inside one of these then they get it, you  
**[0:12:01-0:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:12:01):**  know, oh, okay and they realize that an earthen wall doesn't mean that it's going to melt  
**[0:12:07-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:12:07):**  or it's going to deteriorate and in fact it's quite the opposite and these walls should  
**[0:12:14-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:12:14):**  be timeless and sustainable and should last for hundreds of years if not thousands of  
**[0:12:21-0:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:12:21):**  years if detailed properly. So, you know, it all boils back to proper detailing, proper  
**[0:12:29-0:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:12:29):**  design and proper construction. So, like any method if it's not done right or not done  
**[0:12:36-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:12:36):**  well then you're going to have issues but if it's done correctly then we shouldn't have  
**[0:12:44-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:12:44):**  any issues. So, let's unpack that a little bit. Let's  
**[0:12:47-0:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:12:47):**  talk about some of the ways that you can ensure that a rammed earth structure is done correctly.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:12:53):**  Let's talk about a little bit of that composition that allows it to weather what most people  
**[0:12:58-0:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:12:58):**  would consider conditions that would not be correct for building something with clay because  
**[0:13:05-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:13:05):**  rammed earth is one of the few natural building materials that I have not had any personal  
**[0:13:10-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:13:10):**  experience with and I'm really interested to know how you sort of solve these issues  
**[0:13:17-0:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:13:17):**  and made sure that these structures are going to last for a long time.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:13:21):**  Yeah, so I've actually seen both. I've seen it done well and I've seen it done not well  
**[0:13:31-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:13:31):**  and so just like any other method you know you want to start with the right soil composition  
**[0:13:38-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:13:38):**  so you're looking for that kind of 70% sand to 30% clay and I have been able to find that  
**[0:13:51-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:13:51):**  particular soil. I have a source here that it comes from so I've identified the right  
**[0:14:00-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:14:00):**  soil and done some testing on it just to make sure it's the right clay to sand proportions  
**[0:14:11-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:14:11):**  and there's not a bunch of silt or organic material in it. So that's the first step is  
**[0:14:16-0:14:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:14:16):**  finding the right clay soil.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:14:19):**  And how do you test to make sure that those ratios are what you're looking for?  
**[0:14:23-0:14:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:14:23):**  Yeah, so I work with a testing lab here in the Charleston area. They are a soil testing  
**[0:14:30-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:14:30):**  lab, geotechnical engineers and they can run different kinds of tests that will tell you  
**[0:14:37-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:14:37):**  the basically break all that down for you and then you know they you know sand just  
**[0:14:47-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:14:47):**  clay soil. Clay to sand is a very broad and generic way of talking about it and because  
**[0:14:56-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:14:56):**  they get into much more detail with clay soil can be categorized in hundreds of different  
**[0:15:06-0:15:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:15:06):**  soil types but the bottom line is that they have some tests that they can run and then  
**[0:15:14-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:15:14):**  also I have some of my own you know sort of what I call backyard test that I do which  
**[0:15:20-0:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:15:20):**  is you know the standard jar test where you put the soil in the jar of water, the worm  
**[0:15:28-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:15:28):**  test where you roll it into a worm, the making little hamburger patties out of the soil and  
**[0:15:36-0:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:15:36):**  letting it dry in the sun. So lots of the kind of backyard soil tests that I think most  
**[0:15:44-0:15:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:15:44):**  of us have in the natural building world have learned to do. So just lots of experimenting,

**[0:19:02-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:19:02):**  other listeners who will ask these questions otherwise. Really what is the difference in

**[0:19:39-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:19:39):**  and over the years. Have you ever tried putting renders or plasters  
**[0:19:41-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:19:41):**  on your own rammed earth walls? I know that's not common.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:19:45):**  Yeah, so you can do that but most people are drawn to this method because of the beautiful  
**[0:19:56-0:20:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:19:56):**  natural aesthetic of the layering that you get with rammed earth because you're compacting

**[0:20:08-0:20:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:20:08):**  really with any other method. So a lot of people are drawn to this method because of

**[0:20:21-0:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:20:21):**  the only methods where you don't have to do any finishing to the walls once the form work  
**[0:20:27-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:20:27):**  comes down. So historically these structures did use a lime render on both sides and it  
**[0:20:39-0:20:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:20:39):**  was over the years they would replaster it and the wall the buildings that have lasted  
**[0:20:45-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:20:45):**  the longest are the ones that had ongoing plaster work happening over the years. Every  
**[0:20:54-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:20:54):**  five or six years or whatever they would come in and do another plaster render. So I think  
**[0:21:01-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:21:01):**  the integrity of those walls had a lot to do with that kind of sacrificial plaster layer  
**[0:21:08-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:21:08):**  and so the problem that I also encounter with modern day building is that we have to meet  
**[0:21:19-0:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:21:19):**  really stringent codes. In my area we have seismic, really high seismic which a lot of  
**[0:21:27-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:21:27):**  people don't realize here in South Carolina but this particular region we have high seismic  
**[0:21:33-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:21:33):**  and we have 150 mile per hour hurricane. So the engineering and the codes that we have  
**[0:21:41-0:21:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:21:41):**  to meet are just so stringent that I work with a structural engineer and he in order  
**[0:21:50-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:21:50):**  for us to really gain the confidence of the code officials and really the general public  
**[0:22:01-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:22:01):**  I just found that when you add just that small amount of cement you get a much stronger wall.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:22:12):**  Without the cement what I have found is while it's still strong and there's no doubt in  
**[0:22:17-0:22:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:22:17):**  my mind that it would be fine I mean I would build an unstabilized rammed structure and  
**[0:22:22-0:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:22:22):**  live in it. The problem is having to get it through all of the bureaucracy and all of  
**[0:22:30-0:22:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:22:30):**  the codes and all of the permitting. You can just gain people's confidence a lot more when  
**[0:22:37-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:22:37):**  you have a wall system that's not flaking or crumbling you do get a little bit more  
**[0:22:46-0:22:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:22:46):**  I have found you get a little bit more of the dusting and the crumbling without that  
**[0:22:52-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:22:52):**  stabilization. And so and I prefer to not plaster the walls for the reasons that I mentioned  
**[0:23:01-0:23:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:23:01):**  before. So let's talk about those aesthetic aggregate  
**[0:23:07-0:23:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:23:07):**  layers that you add in there. What do you do to sort of highlight the different layers  
**[0:23:12-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:23:12):**  and add color and some depth to those walls to get the aesthetic finish that you're looking  
**[0:23:18-0:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:23:18):**  for? So far we haven't really added any color  
**[0:23:24-0:23:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:23:24):**  I mean we're just using the color of the earth that that soil and that soil really is what  
**[0:23:32-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:23:32):**  determines the color. And so we really just haven't done anything at this point to change  
**[0:23:46-0:23:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:23:46):**  the color or add pigment. And you just you end up seeing the natural striations just  
**[0:23:54-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:23:54):**  from how it's compacted. And then there's just a lot of natural changes to the color  
**[0:24:05-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:24:05):**  that you see just when you know there might be more sand or clay in certain areas. So  
**[0:24:13-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:24:13):**  you end up seeing just the beautiful variations of the clay soil itself. But at this point  
**[0:24:23-0:24:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:24:23):**  yeah I have not I have not really experimented with adding any kind of pigments to change  
**[0:24:30-0:24:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:24:30):**  the color. Fair enough. So I know from following your

**[0:27:43-0:27:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:27:43):**  incorporating natural building systems. So I'm looking to really in a sense create a  
**[0:27:50-0:27:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:27:50):**  market for them here in Charleston so we can come up with a prototype for a timber framed

**[0:28:33-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:28:33):**  has to be custom examined and what system, what method you use has to be determined by

**[0:29:09-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:29:09):**  where there are pros and cons to each one and then that person can choose which prototype

**[0:29:22-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:29:22):**  with Liz Gjondro as well with the timber framing workshops haven't you?

**[0:29:36-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:29:36):**  when I embarked on my journey and she and I have just really kept in close contact over  
**[0:29:42-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:29:42):**  the years and she's been a mentor of mine. I've been down and worked with her in Nicaragua  
**[0:29:48-0:29:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:29:48):**  several times and then she has just recently asked me to serve on her board for her Pueblo  
**[0:29:59-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:29:59):**  project which is her nonprofit organization that does a lot of work in Central America.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:30:06):**  Oh that's excellent. Yeah so I'm super excited about that. So yeah I will be working with  
**[0:30:12-0:30:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:30:12):**  Liz and her more in the coming years as I start to develop that relationship on her  
**[0:30:20-0:30:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:30:20):**  board and working with her now and helping to design a timber framed structure up in

**[0:30:37-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:30:37):**  So yeah. Liz is fantastic. She was the teacher on the first natural building workshop that  
**[0:30:45-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:30:45):**  I assisted on here in Guatemala and she was on, if anybody is interested in hearing from  
**[0:30:51-0:30:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:30:51):**  her, her interview is in season one and she had some fantastic insights as well as great  
**[0:30:57-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:30:57):**  explanations of the Pueblo project in Nicaragua as well.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:31:01):**  Yes she's fantastic, great resource. So aside from all of these different types  
**[0:31:06-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:31:06):**  of natural building materials that you're using to address the challenges of your region,  
**[0:31:11-0:31:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:31:11):**  I know you've also pioneered using natural materials to renovate conventional homes.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:31:16):**  Could you talk about some of the challenges in that context and where you found the most  
**[0:31:21-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:31:21):**  success in integrating natural materials in industrial homes?  
**[0:31:28-0:31:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:31:28):**  Yeah, so mostly it's just been cosmetic, aesthetic situations. So like in my own home,  
**[0:31:42-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:31:42):**  and my home has really served as my experimental playground over the years. So I mean I've  
**[0:31:51-0:32:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:31:51):**  done some crazy funky things like cob and fill and just playing around with different  
**[0:32:00-0:32:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:32:00):**  clay plasters and paint. So most of the conventional renovation applications has been more about  
**[0:32:16-0:32:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:32:16):**  using clay paints, clay plasters or lime plasters and I'm just increasingly trying to encourage  
**[0:32:24-0:32:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:32:24):**  clients to go with natural paints and natural plasters and we have artisans in this region  
**[0:32:33-0:32:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:32:33):**  who are well versed in lime plasters. And so I'm doing, I have clients with 1950s  
**[0:32:43-0:32:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:32:43):**  kind of mid-century homes that are looking to modernize and so we're bringing in lime  
**[0:32:50-0:33:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:32:50):**  plasters and really it's more about the finishes, the plasters and paints. I haven't to this  
**[0:33:01-0:33:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:33:01):**  point done any kind of like insulation or wall systems so to speak.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:33:08):**  Fair enough. I know you also focus a lot on low carbon building and energy efficiency  
**[0:33:14-0:33:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:33:14):**  within homes. Now one of the things that I often try and get through to the students  
**[0:33:18-0:33:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:33:18):**  that I have here on my own natural building workshops is that building with natural materials  
**[0:33:24-0:33:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:33:24):**  does not automatically mean that you're going to have an energy efficient home. Could you  
**[0:33:28-0:33:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:33:28):**  talk about some of the challenges of communicating that to clients first of all and making sure  
**[0:33:34-0:33:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:33:34):**  that the correct materials are designed in such a way that energy efficiency is a part

**[0:33:44-0:33:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:33:44):**  Yeah, this is quite a topic. So I think one of the first things I try to do with any new  
**[0:33:58-0:34:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:33:58):**  client is really zero in and identify what their priorities are because when you say  
**[0:34:09-0:34:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:34:09):**  things like energy efficiency or green home or a natural home that can mean so many different  
**[0:34:16-0:34:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:34:16):**  things and oftentimes unfortunately the vision and the goals don't align with the budget.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:34:27):**  So the challenge is always in okay let's really identify the things that are most important  
**[0:34:37-0:34:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:34:37):**  to you. If you're saying energy efficiency are you talking about you want a super insulated  
**[0:34:46-0:34:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:34:46):**  sealed up home, passive house kind of style with a really efficient HVAC system or are  
**[0:34:56-0:35:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:34:56):**  you wanting a more passive home where we are integrating passive cooling strategies so  
**[0:35:06-0:35:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:35:06):**  that you're just not even having to turn the air conditioner on as little as possible.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:35:17):**  I mean really just to start with my opinion is just minimizing the square footage and  
**[0:35:27-0:35:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:35:27):**  having a really good design from the start. So you can really minimize your square footage  
**[0:35:37-0:35:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:35:37):**  which is then going to minimize your energy use from the start and yeah there's just so  
**[0:35:48-0:36:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:35:48):**  many different ways to address these things. So for me it's just it's always I find that  
**[0:36:02-0:36:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:36:02):**  people a lot of times don't really know what they want and they're kind of they know they  
**[0:36:07-0:36:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:36:07):**  want a home that is more sustainable and more has that lower carbon footprint but they don't  
**[0:36:17-0:36:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:36:17):**  really quite know how to get there or exactly what they want. So I have to try and help  
**[0:36:23-0:36:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:36:23):**  them determine really what their goals are and then we look at the whole system. Would

**[0:36:39-0:36:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:36:39):**  to use it. There's some clients who really just don't like air condition and they want

**[0:38:52-0:38:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:38:52):**  pretty mild but our summers are intense. So cooling is the much bigger issue here. But  
**[0:38:59-0:39:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:38:59):**  you know people if you look at the old vernacular architecture you see the high ceilings, you  
**[0:39:06-0:39:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:39:06):**  see the covered porches, transom windows. You start to see how people were able to passively  
**[0:39:16-0:39:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:39:16):**  cool their homes and now you know that a lot of that knowledge has gone out the window.  
**[0:39:21-0:39:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:39:21):**  So I try to bring a lot of that back you know and say okay here's the low hanging fruit  
**[0:39:28-0:39:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:39:28):**  you know first let's reduce the square footage. Let's just you know get a really tight efficient  
**[0:39:34-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:39:34):**  plan. We don't need a lot of square footage and then if we have the ability to position  
**[0:39:41-0:39:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:39:41):**  it on a site the way that we want to you don't always have that option. But if you do you  
**[0:39:47-0:39:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:39:47):**  know how can we properly shade the sun in the hot months and then let it in the cool  
**[0:39:56-0:40:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:39:56):**  days. And you know that's the biggest thing right there. But even I mean like my house  
**[0:40:05-0:40:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:40:05):**  it's a 1950s house and it's not positioned on the site the way I would want it. But some  
**[0:40:11-0:40:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:40:11):**  things that I've done is I've put I've done some lime plaster on the western facade which  
**[0:40:18-0:40:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:40:18):**  really helps with cooling in the in the summertime that late afternoon sun. I've actually I've  
**[0:40:26-0:40:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:40:26):**  took a temperature reading as an experiment one day. I have sort of a light gray masonry  
**[0:40:35-0:40:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:40:35):**  home and then I did a lime plaster over it and it was a 20 degree difference surface  
**[0:40:42-0:40:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:40:42):**  temperature. And is that just because the white of the lime reflects more of the heat  
**[0:40:46-0:40:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:40:46):**  off? Yep just that reflective quality. So even something as simple as just like the  
**[0:40:53-0:41:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:40:53):**  color that you choose or you know lime just has these amazing cooling properties to it  
**[0:41:00-0:41:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:41:00):**  or even you know sun shades or getting into some of the permaculture ideas of planting  
**[0:41:10-0:41:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:41:10):**  the right kind of trees and plants on the you know western facade or the western side  
**[0:41:16-0:41:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:41:16):**  so you're shading yourself from that late afternoon sun or maybe you put the living  
**[0:41:26-0:41:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:41:26):**  spaces on the cooler side of the house. So and then around here also we have so much  
**[0:41:36-0:41:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:41:36):**  water. So water catchment systems are really nice ways of just mitigating some of that  
**[0:41:42-0:41:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:41:42):**  water that would flood your yard. OK well let's just gutter the eaves and get some cisterns  
**[0:41:48-0:41:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:41:48):**  and let's capture that water you know and you can just reuse it on as irrigation or  
**[0:41:55-0:42:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:41:55):**  if you want to you know add a pump and a filter you can pump it back in and flush your toilets  
**[0:42:01-0:42:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:42:01):**  with it. So it's there's just varying degrees on every project of what can be done and unfortunately  
**[0:42:11-0:42:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:42:11):**  it's largely determined by the budget. It's just the reality of most projects you know  
**[0:42:18-0:42:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:42:18):**  I tend to see people come to the table and with so many ideas you know I want all solar

**[0:42:33-0:42:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:42:33):**  you know I'm always like the bearer of bad news.

**[0:43:48-0:43:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:43:48):**  owner builder kind of scenarios. Of course you're going to spend a lot less money that  
**[0:43:54-0:44:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:43:54):**  way. But I have first of all I have some information on my website where I address costs and I  
**[0:44:03-0:44:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:44:03):**  try to get people just a real honest opinion about costs upfront. But then I typically  
**[0:44:12-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:44:12):**  offer a kind of one hour consultation session with any potential client where they can come  
**[0:44:19-0:44:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:44:19):**  in and let's just sit down and brainstorm on your project and then by the time they  
**[0:44:24-0:44:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:44:24):**  leave I can typically give them just some real ballpark ideas of cost you know cost  
**[0:44:29-0:44:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:44:29):**  per square foot whether they're going to build themselves or whether they're looking to hire

**[0:44:41-0:44:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:44:41):**  your cost. So it's a conversation that I have gotten really comfortable with and you know  
**[0:44:49-0:44:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:44:49):**  there is a lot of misinformation out there. And it's kind of what I tell people is like  
**[0:44:56-0:45:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:44:56):**  it's kind of like anything you know think about food. Okay you can go to Food Lion and  
**[0:45:03-0:45:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:45:03):**  buy a little Debbie cake for you know 75 cents or conventional grown produce but and it's  
**[0:45:16-0:45:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-reviving-rammed-earth-and-hybrid-natural-buildings-with-april-magill-of-root-down-designs-085/#t=0:45:16):**  going to be at a lower price point but you could go to your local farmers market and

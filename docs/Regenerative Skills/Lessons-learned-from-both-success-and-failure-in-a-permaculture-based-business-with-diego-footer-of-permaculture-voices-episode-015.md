**[0:00:58-0:01:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:00:58):**  first started his business, what he learned from the experience and some valuable advice

**[0:01:10-0:01:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:01:10):**  landscapes that are often the reasons why people quit early.

**[0:01:23-0:01:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:01:23):**  How are you doing?  
**[0:01:24-0:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:01:24):**  I'm doing well.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:01:25):**  Thanks for having me on.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:01:26):**  I appreciate you giving me the chance to talk to your audience.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:01:28):**  Hey it's my pleasure.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:01:30):**  I've been following your podcast for quite a while and you've been one of the inspirations  
**[0:01:33-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:01:33):**  for why I do this as well.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:01:35):**  It's good to hear.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:01:36):**  It's cool to see because I've said this on my show before, not a lot of people actually  
**[0:01:40-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:01:40):**  go through and start their own podcast.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:01:42):**  I hear a lot of people want to do it or talk about doing it and very few actually follow  
**[0:01:45-0:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:01:45):**  through and do it.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:01:46):**  So good on you for actually doing it.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:01:49):**  Well thank you.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:01:50):**  On that note let's jump right in.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:01:51):**  I've got a ton of questions I want to ask you and my listeners I'm sure are big fans  
**[0:01:56-0:01:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:01:56):**  of what you do as well so let's get started.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:01:59):**  So if you could tell me a little bit about yourself and your background first.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:02:03):**  How did you first get into permaculture?  
**[0:02:07-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:02:07):**  Backed into it through health.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:02:09):**  A client from the business I was working at back in 2007 sent me a book that really inspired  
**[0:02:15-0:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:02:15):**  him.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:02:16):**  It was a book called Anti-Cancer talking about a man and his wife going through cancer.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:02:22):**  That book really shocked me in terms of the food I was eating.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:02:25):**  I kind of described the food I was eating at the time as the men's health level of nutrition,  
**[0:02:32-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:02:32):**  supplements that type of thing.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:02:34):**  So reading that book it was a big realization food has a link to cancer.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:02:38):**  That sent me down a rabbit hole of watching all these videos out there.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:02:43):**  Everything from the food inks through forks over knives and then I started getting into  
**[0:02:49-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:02:49):**  eating your healthy and usually when you go down that route you start looking at growing  
**[0:02:53-0:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:02:53):**  your own food.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:02:54):**  It got me into things like soil remineralization and in looking through those videos at the  
**[0:02:58-0:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:02:58):**  time I stumbled upon some of the old Bill Mollison videos or Jeff Lawton videos on YouTube  
**[0:03:04-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:03:04):**  and Seth Polzer's work that got me sucked into permaculture.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:03:08):**  Started gardening from there and it's been an ongoing journey from 2007 ever since.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:03:14):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:03:15):**  I think a lot of people who listen to these resources would find a really similar path  
**[0:03:20-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:03:20):**  that they got into as well.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:03:22):**  Health and the sources of food that we consume are a big reason why people find their way  
**[0:03:28-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:03:28):**  into permaculture and other regenerative lifestyle skills.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:03:31):**  I think so.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:03:32):**  It's the commonality and it's the most personal thing where you see people sick and if you  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:03:38):**  make that connection between that could happen to me and look at the food I'm eating.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:03:43):**  Could the food lead to potential illness down the line?  
**[0:03:46-0:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:03:46):**  Could I eat better food and change my life now in terms of the way I feel, have more  
**[0:03:50-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:03:50):**  energy, just be healthier?  
**[0:03:53-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:03:53):**  Then you start to look at the egg system and how that food is produced and you start to  
**[0:03:57-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:03:57):**  think well is there a better way?  
**[0:04:00-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:04:00):**  Exactly and it hits home really fast especially for people who are taking care of families  
**[0:04:05-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:04:05):**  or who have had a history of you saying that cancer and wanting to avoid that was one of  
**[0:04:12-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:04:12):**  your motivations.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:04:13):**  I think a lot of people can relate to that.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:04:15):**  Now what point in your permaculture journey did you decide that this is what you want  
**[0:04:20-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:04:20):**  to dedicate your time and your efforts to?  
**[0:04:24-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:04:24):**  It's a tough question to answer.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:04:26):**  I'm somebody who lets myself get pulled along with personal interests.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:04:33):**  I'm somebody who finds something new and if I really gravitate towards it I really gravitate  
**[0:04:38-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:04:38):**  towards it and start to go all in on it.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:04:42):**  Read about it, watch as much as I can, start practicing as much as I can.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:04:46):**  Along the way though that's a hobby and where it shifted over to a business for me I guess  
**[0:04:52-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:04:52):**  is that what you're asking in terms of how it's going to go down that route?  
**[0:04:57-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:04:57):**  Well certainly that's a big decision too and I have some other questions about taking those  
**[0:05:01-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:05:01):**  plunges into actually supporting yourself and doing the business.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:05:05):**  But what part of the concepts of permaculture, I know you mentioned the health motivation  
**[0:05:10-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:05:10):**  but were there other parts that really sealed the deal for you and made you focus your efforts  
**[0:05:15-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:05:15):**  into making a transition towards permaculture and regenerative based efforts?  
**[0:05:21-0:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:05:21):**  It's probably not what the permaculture teachers would want to hear but there was really the  
**[0:05:25-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:05:25):**  coolness of it, the inspiration that came out of permaculture, the earlier videos that  
**[0:05:31-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:05:31):**  were out there.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:05:32):**  There wasn't as much out there, nearly as much out there as there is today going back  
**[0:05:36-0:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:05:36):**  ten years.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:05:37):**  So it was seeing the work that people like Jeff Lawton were doing with the greening the  
**[0:05:42-0:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:05:42):**  desert, that inspired me.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:05:45):**  That made me think wow, look what you could do.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:05:47):**  You could take this burned out patch of land and turn it into something lush.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:05:53):**  Even though I didn't have that to work with at the time because I was still renting where  
**[0:05:57-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:05:57):**  I was living, it inspired me.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:06:01):**  I am somebody I think who likes to chase challenges too and I like the idea of taking something  
**[0:06:06-0:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:06:06):**  that somebody wouldn't think would be possible and converting it into something that was  
**[0:06:09-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:06:09):**  possible.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:06:12):**  Seeing all the work that the first generation of permaculture people had put out there was  
**[0:06:18-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:06:18):**  really what got me motivated.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:06:20):**  The more I learned about it, the more it made sense in terms of a design system.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:06:25):**  Things like stacking functions and greatest effect for least amount of change.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:06:33):**  Those types of principles really resonated with me.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:06:36):**  I'm an engineer, my background.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:06:38):**  Those principles, a lot overlapped with what you do in engineering and I think they just  
**[0:06:43-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:06:43):**  made sense.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:06:44):**  But initially the thing that got me hooked and really got me into it was seeing what  
**[0:06:50-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:06:50):**  the big people were doing.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:06:51):**  That was inspiring.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:06:52):**  Then going out and doing it because it's one of the things you can do and start to see  
**[0:06:57-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:06:57):**  an impact on and participate in really right away.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:07:01):**  Somebody can go out and start planting trees and doing work on the land where other hobbies  
**[0:07:06-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:07:06):**  and other things require investment or longer time frames to play out.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:07:11):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:07:13):**  I think you and I have a lot of commonalities.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:07:15):**  My background is in engineering as well and that video about regreening the desert from  
**[0:07:20-0:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:07:20):**  Jeff Lawton was also one of the huge drivers that got me to focus in and do so much more  
**[0:07:25-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:07:25):**  research and sort of devote the direction of my own business in that way.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:07:32):**  Yeah, I think that's a big video that's got most people into this sector.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:07:37):**  It's just so inspiring when you see a before and after and it's real.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:07:42):**  You can't deny it.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:07:45):**  I think it challenges people's paradigms.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:07:48):**  They think desert is one thing and the general approach I think to desertification is it's  
**[0:07:54-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:07:54):**  getting worse.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:07:56):**  We just have to go along with it and here's somebody showing, well, no, you can stop,  
**[0:08:01-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:08:01):**  do the work and design your way out of this slowly.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:08:07):**  By utilizing all these natural patterns and a design system, you can reverse the effects  
**[0:08:12-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:08:12):**  of desertification even on a small scale and then hopefully down generations do it on a  
**[0:08:18-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:08:18):**  much larger scale.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:08:19):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:08:20):**  There are so many other types of landscapes that you can regenerate but of course the  
**[0:08:25-0:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:08:25):**  desert all of a sudden into a forest makes for really great before and after pictures.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:08:30):**  Now you were saying that those were some of the motivations that really made this click,  
**[0:08:36-0:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:08:36):**  made this make sense to you.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:08:37):**  And now since then, how has your life changed and what have been some of the accomplishments  
**[0:08:42-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:08:42):**  that you're most proud of?  
**[0:08:45-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:08:45):**  I think I've came a long way in terms of permaculture and maybe full circle.  
**[0:08:51-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:08:51):**  I started out with that irrational exuberance, a bit of innate ignorance around it, seeing  
**[0:09:00-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:09:00):**  that work and just being inspired by it but not truly understanding what went into it.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:09:08):**  And along the way in that permaculture journey, as I learned more, I felt like there was a  
**[0:09:14-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:09:14):**  lot of claims being made in permaculture that were very much unsubstantiated.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:09:20):**  And I thought that devalued some of the work that had already been done and some of the  
**[0:09:25-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:09:25):**  design system itself.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:09:28):**  And then I have kind of now gotten to the point where I've let go of that and said,  
**[0:09:33-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:09:33):**  just let the design system do what it has or do what it can.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:09:38):**  Utilize it for what it is.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:09:39):**  It's a tool.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:09:40):**  If some people want to claim it does one thing, so what?  
**[0:09:42-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:09:42):**  That doesn't matter.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:09:43):**  So I now look at work that's done on the landscape that's been successful in a totally different  
**[0:09:50-0:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:09:50):**  way.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:09:51):**  I'm in awe.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:09:52):**  I still think, wow, that's awesome when I see those types of landscapes.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:09:56):**  But having done a lot of work on a personal level, I understand the massive amount of  
**[0:10:02-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:10:02):**  time, planning, work, effort, water, and money that goes into creating those changes.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:10:11):**  It's like watching one of those home makeover shows on TV.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:10:15):**  If you just watch the beginning first five minutes and the last five minutes, you see  
**[0:10:19-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:10:19):**  a tremendous turnaround.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:10:20):**  But there's days in between there and tons of people throwing in effort at the change  
**[0:10:25-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:10:25):**  that comes at the beginning of the show to the end of the show.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:10:28):**  And that's no different than landscapes.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:10:29):**  And initially I looked at these landscapes and thought, wow, I knew work went in, but  
**[0:10:33-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:10:33):**  I didn't understand how much.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:10:36):**  And part of that appreciation of the work that goes in, and this is probably what I'm  
**[0:10:41-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:10:41):**  most proud of, is going out there myself and doing projects that on the surface I probably  
**[0:10:49-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:10:49):**  wouldn't have thought I can do, and putting the time and work in to get those projects  
**[0:10:55-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:10:55):**  done.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:10:56):**  Whether that's on a very small scale, turning around the landscape on the property that  
**[0:11:00-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:11:00):**  I own, moving big piles of soil around, mulching areas, filling up garden beds.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:11:08):**  All things that take a massive amount of time.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:11:11):**  I've spent thousands of hours doing that since I've had my property.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:11:15):**  And it's something that's just been chipped away at, but I think when the common person,  
**[0:11:20-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:11:20):**  the average person just walks by a property, they never notice those changes.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:11:25):**  And for me, that work has been what's been most fulfilling.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:11:28):**  It's doing the work, doing the accomplishments, so I'm most proud of that.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:11:32):**  And then by doing that work and seeing the amount of work it takes to make those changes  
**[0:11:37-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:11:37):**  happen, that's what's caused me to come full circle when I see these designs, where it's  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:11:43):**  now just, that's awesome, but man, they did a lot of work and a lot of people and a lot  
**[0:11:48-0:11:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:11:48):**  of time went into these changes.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:11:51):**  And also thinking going forward, how are we going to change a lot of these landscapes  
**[0:11:56-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:11:56):**  now that are getting worse, or how are we going to change farms around?  
**[0:12:00-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:12:00):**  And knowing this time effect, I'm very slow to say, oh, just apply permaculture, that'll  
**[0:12:09-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:12:09):**  fix it, that'll solve the problems that we have.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:12:13):**  And while that's true on some level, it's going to take a long time and there's a long  
**[0:12:20-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:12:20):**  curve to go from start to finish, and that's only going to come through the dedication  
**[0:12:25-0:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:12:25):**  of a lot of hard work for a lot of people to make those changes.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:12:29):**  So that's really how I've come full circle in this all, and it's been through the work  
**[0:12:34-0:12:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:12:34):**  that I've done that I'm most proud of, which is just the long slow grind of getting projects  
**[0:12:39-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:12:39):**  done and not seeking out the instant gratification of it all.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:12:45):**  I'm really glad you brought that up because it's one of the things that doesn't get talked  
**[0:12:48-0:12:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:12:48):**  about that much, either in permaculture or in natural building.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:12:52):**  All that unglamorous work that doesn't make it to the highlight reel, to the after photos  
**[0:12:57-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:12:57):**  and the ways that you can show off the finished product.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:13:02):**  But really, if you're not invested and if you don't have the stamina to go through that  
**[0:13:06-0:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:13:06):**  aspect of it, you're never going to arrive at your goals.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:13:09):**  So I'm really glad you brought that up.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:13:11):**  I'll tell you a story in relation to natural building that further emphasizes this point.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:13:17):**  I've been involved in one natural building project ever.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:13:20):**  It's just not an area that I don't know anybody really doing it.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:13:24):**  So one person I do know doing it, I got involved with a project they were doing just for one  
**[0:13:29-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:13:29):**  day, maybe three years ago.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:13:31):**  I went an hour and a half across San Diego to this project out in the middle of the desert,  
**[0:13:35-0:13:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:13:35):**  and they were building a – it's probably not the right terminology, but like a straw  
**[0:13:40-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:13:40):**  bale kitchen.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:13:42):**  So they had framed out this room.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:13:45):**  I'll say it wasn't huge.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:13:46):**  It was maybe 15 by 15, maybe 20 by 20, just a square with, let's say, a concrete floor  
**[0:13:53-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:13:53):**  on it.  
**[0:13:55-0:14:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:13:55):**  They had framed it out with wood and they were putting straw bales in between the framing,  
**[0:14:01-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:14:01):**  and then they would dunk the straw bales in like a clay slip, for lack of a better word.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:14:07):**  Probably not the right terminology.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:14:10):**  You would then take the cob or the clay on the outside of this building and I would just  
**[0:14:17-0:14:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:14:17):**  push it on.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:14:18):**  The people that were experienced with this were like, no, you got to use your fingers  
**[0:14:22-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:14:22):**  and push the clay into the straw bale.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:14:27):**  I'm looking at this building thinking, okay, it's a 20 by 20-foot building.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:14:33):**  It's 10 feet high.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:14:35):**  There's some massive amount of straw bales in here, 100, and you're looking to take three  
**[0:14:42-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:14:42):**  hours per straw bale to pound all this clay in.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:14:46):**  I remember just working and working, and it was like there was 30 people there working  
**[0:14:51-0:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:14:51):**  on this building.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:14:52):**  It wasn't like the building was done in a day.  
**[0:14:55-0:15:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:14:55):**  The building was going to take weeks to finish, given the way that they were approaching it.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:15:00):**  I had a new appreciation for, well, if this is really the right way, there's a lot of  
**[0:15:04-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:15:04):**  work involved here where I think people initially, just like you're saying, they see the finished  
**[0:15:09-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:15:09):**  product, they want the finished product, and they don't understand how much finger action  
**[0:15:13-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:15:13):**  goes into that finished product.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:15:15):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:15:16):**  That's been one of my biggest uphill battles when speaking with clients who get really  
**[0:15:21-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:15:21):**  excited about these projects and the fact that in a lot of cases, especially where I  
**[0:15:25-0:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:15:25):**  am in Guatemala, the projects can be done for a very small budget, but they want all  
**[0:15:31-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:15:31):**  of the different aspects at the same time.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:15:33):**  They want it to be done quickly.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:15:35):**  They want it to be done cheap, and they want it to be done at a high quality.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:15:39):**  Sort of stopping and explaining the process is often the part that is the least popular.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:15:46):**  I always appreciate when people bring some attention to the fact that these processes,  
**[0:15:53-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:15:53):**  if done correctly, are really an investment in time, labor, and often education, making  
**[0:15:59-0:16:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:15:59):**  sure that you do it right the first time.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:16:00):**  Well, that's it.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:16:01):**  We're in a society that wants it all now.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:16:04):**  If I can't just go pick it up at Home Depot or have Amazon Prime deliver it, well, then  
**[0:16:09-0:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:16:09):**  I'm not satisfied.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:16:11):**  Where if you take the time that goes into building one of these straw bill structures  
**[0:16:15-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:16:15):**  appropriately initially and then extrapolate that over the life of that structure, it's  
**[0:16:22-0:16:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:16:22):**  a finite amount of time, but it seems like a ton in the beginning when you just want  
**[0:16:26-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:16:26):**  the building and the building is taking forever to get built, but people just don't think  
**[0:16:32-0:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:16:32):**  that way in today's time.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:16:34):**  They're thinking, I want the building now.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:16:36):**  I don't care if I'm going to have it 50 or 60 or 100 years from now.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:16:40):**  That's not what's important to me.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:16:41):**  I need it tomorrow.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:16:43):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:16:44):**  Now, I know that you personally took on the challenge of building a permaculture-based  
**[0:16:49-0:16:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:16:49):**  business at a time when most people would be looking for security and stability.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:16:54):**  On top of that, you say you had a major business failure too.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:16:58):**  Tell me the story of how that all happened.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:17:00):**  What was going through your mind at the time and how did you bounce back from that setback?  
**[0:17:04-0:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:17:04):**  Yeah, the business probably follows along the line of that irrational exuberance and  
**[0:17:10-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:17:10):**  ignorance that I had when I first got into permaculture because I think I looked at the  
**[0:17:16-0:17:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:17:16):**  permaculture space and I wanted a permaculture-based business or I wanted a business really.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:17:23):**  I didn't have to be permaculture-based, so I think I imposed a business upon the permaculture  
**[0:17:31-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:17:31):**  space without really doing as much planning, stress testing, due diligence as I should  
**[0:17:39-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:17:39):**  have when I launched that business.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:17:42):**  Now, which business was that?  
**[0:17:44-0:17:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:17:44):**  This is the conference.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:17:45):**  Okay.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:17:46):**  When I did the first conference back in 2013, the initial thought was there's an opportunity  
**[0:17:54-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:17:54):**  here.  
**[0:17:55-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:17:55):**  That was it.  
**[0:17:56-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:17:56):**  I didn't necessarily want to run a conference.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:17:59):**  I didn't necessarily think it was the best business.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:18:03):**  At a nuts and bolts level, I just dove into it thinking that was a really good opportunity  
**[0:18:08-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:18:08):**  here.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:18:09):**  I think I can make it work.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:18:10):**  I can make some money.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:18:11):**  I like doing this.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:18:12):**  I'm interested in this space.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:18:14):**  If it works, great.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:18:15):**  There's a future here.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:18:17):**  I did that, again, out of not enough planning and I would never approach it that way ever  
**[0:18:25-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:18:25):**  again.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:18:27):**  I've since now questioned when I hear permaculture business, I've asked this on my podcast, what  
**[0:18:32-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:18:32):**  is that?  
**[0:18:33-0:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:18:33):**  I'm not quite sure what a permaculture business is.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:18:36):**  A lot of people, I think they say, is your business involved in permaculture?  
**[0:18:40-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:18:40):**  It kind of is, but really I was a conference business that focused on permaculture.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:18:47):**  I didn't really have a permaculture business, so I'm reluctant to say that.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:18:50):**  Similarly, I wouldn't call anything like natural building or a composting business or a farm  
**[0:18:56-0:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:18:56):**  and permaculture business, but it's easy to extend that umbrella over them.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:19:01):**  Sure, I understand.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:19:03):**  I did that event because really if we go with the I was looking for a permaculture business  
**[0:19:10-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:19:10):**  theme, and I guess in some ways I kind of was looking for a business within this space.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:19:16):**  The real business is that people would start within permaculture and really still today  
**[0:19:21-0:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:19:21):**  this is no different.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:19:23):**  They're going to teach, they're going to do design work, or they're going to do some sort  
**[0:19:27-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:19:27):**  of eco-service like installing garden beds, installing landscaping, composting.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:19:36):**  Those were the things.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:19:37):**  I didn't want to do that.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:19:38):**  I wanted something I could do from home and I wanted something I could do on the side.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:19:43):**  Fast forward ahead three iterations of that event and in hindsight, all that non-planning,  
**[0:19:52-0:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:19:52):**  all that not as thorough planning that I needed to do at the beginning turned out to come  
**[0:20:00-0:20:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:20:00):**  to light.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:20:01):**  Finally, it had all floated through and it realized it just wasn't a business that worked.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:20:05):**  Where it really hit me the hardest was after the second conference where I took a big loss  
**[0:20:13-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:20:13):**  after that.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:20:17):**  That's the danger of falling a passion, forcing something, not doing the research is you end  
**[0:20:29-0:20:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:20:29):**  up with something that doesn't work.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:20:31):**  That's what I had.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:20:32):**  I had something that didn't work at all.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:20:36):**  The recovery from that has been slow.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:20:37):**  It's still there.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:20:40):**  Yet I'll say that even though that business failed, it failed financially.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:20:48):**  If we look at the eight forms of capital that Gregory Landaway and Ethan Rowland came up  
**[0:20:55-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:20:55):**  with, financial capital is one of the eight forms.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:20:59):**  There's other forms like spiritual, experiential, social capital.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:21:04):**  I benefited in all those other ways over the three years of doing that event.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:21:13):**  I try and compartmentalize how did that event fail.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:21:17):**  It failed as a business.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:21:19):**  It failed financially, but I built a lot of social capital over that time.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:21:23):**  I gained a lot of experience, real world hard knocks, MBA experience over that time.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:21:29):**  It's through that failure of that business that I still go today.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:21:37):**  I'm using the wreckage of that business to forage a way ahead to build something to get  
**[0:21:42-0:21:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:21:42):**  me forward.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:21:44):**  I'm not sure I would be here today or doing what I'm doing today or have the opportunity  
**[0:21:50-0:21:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:21:50):**  that I have today if I didn't have that disaster that was a business.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:21:57):**  Now, maybe it could have all worked out.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:22:00):**  That's actually an interesting thought.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:22:01):**  Like say that whole business had worked out and it all turned out to be great.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:22:07):**  That could have been a blessing or a curse in disguise.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:22:09):**  Not a blessing in disguise, a curse in disguise because I really don't know that I had thought  
**[0:22:15-0:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:22:15):**  or knew enough to handle the success of it or plan.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:22:19):**  We're now having gone through the disaster going forward.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:22:23):**  I know how to approach things differently.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:22:25):**  I know how to navigate things differently.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:22:30):**  I think people within this space that the thought is, I want to start a business within  
**[0:22:37-0:22:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:22:37):**  this space and they impose that.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:22:40):**  I go to this Larry Santoyoism, if you don't impose the solution, you arrive at the solution.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:22:46):**  If you're forcing a business into this space, which is exactly what I did and what I think  
**[0:22:51-0:22:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:22:51):**  a lot of people do, I think that's the wrong approach.  
**[0:22:54-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:22:54):**  If you want to start a business, I would say look for the best business that there is to  
**[0:23:00-0:23:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:23:00):**  start for you in your context, in your market.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:23:05):**  Maybe that's not within the space.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:23:07):**  Maybe this space is better treated as a hobby.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:23:10):**  Maybe this space is better treated as a pastime or maybe this space is good for a business,  
**[0:23:16-0:23:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:23:16):**  but it's going to take you time to find, to arrive at that right business for the space  
**[0:23:23-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:23:23):**  versus sitting down tomorrow and saying, I want to be an entrepreneur.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:23:27):**  Like permaculture, what type of permaculture business can I start?  
**[0:23:33-0:23:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:23:33):**  That's a bad approach in my opinion.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:23:36):**  Might work for some people.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:23:37):**  I don't know that it's going to work for everybody.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:23:39):**  That's how I ran through the ringer of it all, starting not knowing what I was doing,  
**[0:23:45-0:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:23:45):**  forcing a solution, going through hell, learning from that failing forward and then taking  
**[0:23:51-0:23:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:23:51):**  all those failures and building off of them based on those learnings in a way that I think  
**[0:23:59-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:23:59):**  is going to be much more resilient in the long run.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:24:05):**  What advice based on what you've learned from that failure would you give to people who  
**[0:24:09-0:24:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:24:09):**  want to step up and create permaculture based businesses for themselves?  
**[0:24:14-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:24:14):**  I'll reiterate because we haven't decided on what a permaculture based business is.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:24:19):**  Myself I would call that something, some sort of enterprise or business that uses permaculture  
**[0:24:26-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:24:26):**  principles as sort of an operator's manual and not necessarily just planting gardens  
**[0:24:32-0:24:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:24:32):**  or food forests or what have you.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:24:37):**  I would say first put the operator manual on the back burner.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:24:45):**  Get a business that works first then start layering on the operator manual, the permaculture  
**[0:24:55-0:24:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:24:55):**  principles, the design principles.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:24:59):**  I think this is a big mistake a lot of people make.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:25:03):**  You need a business that survives in reality in the world now first and foremost.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:25:09):**  You need a cash flow generating business.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:25:12):**  Now you can think here's where I want to go long term, here's how I want the business  
**[0:25:17-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:25:17):**  design to look long term, here's how I can involve these principles long term.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:25:26):**  Maybe you can use them in the near term at the beginning but don't become beholden upon  
**[0:25:31-0:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:25:31):**  those.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:25:32):**  If you do sometimes those principles I think will stop you from making moves that you need  
**[0:25:39-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:25:39):**  to make to allow the business to succeed today.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:25:43):**  I always tell people this and I've learned this from experience and I've seen enough  
**[0:25:47-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:25:47):**  examples of this now to know it doesn't matter where you want the business to be in 20 years  
**[0:25:56-0:25:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:25:56):**  if you don't make it to year 20.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:25:58):**  If you don't make it out of year one your 20 year plan doesn't matter.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:26:04):**  If you want the best, most regenerative, most permaculture based business in 2030 the most  
**[0:26:13-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:26:13):**  important thing you need is to make it to 2018 in business and then 2019 and so on.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:26:21):**  That means this is a continuum, it's a pathway.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:26:25):**  This has been really something I've learned from experience and I've heard it from people  
**[0:26:29-0:26:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:26:29):**  that live and die with this.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:26:31):**  Ethan Roland, Gregory Landaway they run Terrigenesis International.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:26:35):**  They work with companies like Lush Cosmetics and they have to explain this to them.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:26:41):**  This is a continuum.

**[0:26:58-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:26:58):**  In fact it probably will be.

**[0:27:06-0:27:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:27:06):**  Meaning can you solve a problem with it?  
**[0:27:11-0:27:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:27:11):**  Is there a big enough customer base?

**[0:27:17-0:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:27:17):**  Are they willing to pay to have this problem solved?  
**[0:27:21-0:27:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:27:21):**  Then I would look at what is your level of interest in this business?  
**[0:27:28-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:27:28):**  This is something I've thought a lot about.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:27:32):**  If you're super passionate about it, it may not be the best business to start.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:27:37):**  You have to follow your passion, follow your bliss to some extent.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:27:41):**  But there's a danger in that because sometimes following your bliss blinds you to the reality  
**[0:27:46-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:27:46):**  that you should be paying attention to.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:27:48):**  You may love natural building but people may say nobody's going to pay for natural building  
**[0:27:54-0:27:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:27:54):**  in San Diego.  
**[0:27:56-0:27:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:27:56):**  You're pushing a string.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:27:58):**  It's just not going to work.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:28:00):**  Maybe your better bet is to start by building repurposed bungalows in people's backyards  
**[0:28:08-0:28:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:28:08):**  that look like barn wood and that type of thing and then slowly integrate natural building  
**[0:28:15-0:28:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:28:15):**  elements into that or tiny houses or something like that on trailers because that's where  
**[0:28:20-0:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:28:20):**  the demand is and then you slowly start to offer other services.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:28:26):**  Your passion comes in here because you don't want to mix up the opportunity with the passion.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:28:31):**  I fell in love I think with the permaculture.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:28:33):**  I imposed it.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:28:34):**  I thought there was an opportunity but I think really that was my passion saying there was  
**[0:28:37-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:28:37):**  an opportunity.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:28:39):**  Then think about do you want to spend 40 hours or more realistically like 60 hours a week  
**[0:28:45-0:28:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:28:45):**  on this thing that you're passionate about.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:28:47):**  A lot of people may love gardening or whatever that thing is but when you do it for a career  
**[0:28:54-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:28:54):**  suddenly your views change.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:28:56):**  You want to do it every day year round for five years.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:29:02):**  You may hate that thing at the end of the day where you still love it spending an hour  
**[0:29:05-0:29:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:29:05):**  or two a night on it or some time on the weekends doing it.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:29:09):**  You got to think about how much do you like doing this and are you going to love doing  
**[0:29:14-0:29:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:29:14):**  this all the time, all parts of it like the crappy parts to the best parts because even  
**[0:29:19-0:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:29:19):**  your dream job is going to suck a lot of the time.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:29:21):**  Again, natural building, I'll go back to that and not something I know a lot about but you  
**[0:29:26-0:29:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:29:26):**  know, the fun part of natural building might be like putting the structure up together,  
**[0:29:30-0:29:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:29:30):**  putting the structure together.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:29:31):**  The hard part of a natural building business is knocking on doors, finding clients, those  
**[0:29:37-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:29:37):**  types of things, probably working out code, legalities, all that boring stuff, the fun  
**[0:29:42-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:29:42):**  parts of the building.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:29:43):**  Do you want to do everything else that goes with it?  
**[0:29:46-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:29:46):**  Then I would say don't let passion be necessarily the driver.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:29:51):**  I think this would suss out with most people.  
**[0:29:56-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:29:56):**  A business that works, meaning it makes money, if you don't love it, that's better than a  
**[0:30:04-0:30:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:30:04):**  business that you love that doesn't make money.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:30:07):**  You can only not make money doing something you love as a business for so long before  
**[0:30:11-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:30:11):**  you hate that thing and you shut down the business.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:30:15):**  A business that makes money, at least it makes money, you're not stressed about that.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:30:19):**  You can learn to love it and slowly swing it to what you love or focus on the parts  
**[0:30:25-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:30:25):**  of that business that you do love and use the money that it's making to hire people  
**[0:30:29-0:30:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:30:29):**  or outsource the parts that you don't love.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:30:32):**  I think that's the thing.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:30:33):**  Find something that works first, then apply your ideology, then look at the passion equation.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:30:41):**  Those are the approaches I would take to it and I don't think those are the intuitive  
**[0:30:46-0:30:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:30:46):**  approaches that anybody takes to it, or at least most people.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:30:49):**  But sometimes that's okay.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:30:50):**  I agree.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:30:51):**  Sure.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:30:52):**  I really resonate with that, especially since I've been working over the past three years  
**[0:30:56-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:30:56):**  to develop my own business and I've gone through a couple of those stages that you've mentioned,  
**[0:31:01-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:31:01):**  being overly focused on the passion portion, realizing how many other hats you have to  
**[0:31:07-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:31:07):**  wear when you're the sole proprietor in the beginning.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:31:11):**  That steep learning curve of doing marketing, doing accounting and all the other managerial  
**[0:31:17-0:31:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:31:17):**  tasks that a lot of people don't think about when they get into something that they're  
**[0:31:21-0:31:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:31:21):**  passionate about.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:31:25):**  Sounds really fun at the get-go.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:31:27):**  There's so many other steps behind it, much like we were talking about at the beginning.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:31:30):**  Exactly.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:31:31):**  I mean, look at what we're doing today here.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:31:32):**  We're talking on a podcast.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:31:34):**  You do a podcast, I do a podcast.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:31:35):**  A lot of people think I want to do a podcast and they don't.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:31:38):**  I think here's one reason why, because the fun part is what we're doing now.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:31:43):**  It's the talking part.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:31:44):**  The part that isn't so fun, at least for me after doing thousands of these, is the editing.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:31:50):**  I hate editing these things.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:31:52):**  I'm sick of looking at audacity.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:31:54):**  I'm sick of editing audio.  
**[0:31:56-0:31:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:31:56):**  I've done it for four years.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:31:58):**  Almost every single day for four years, I just don't want to do it anymore.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:32:03):**  But it's like, what am I going to do?  
**[0:32:06-0:32:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:32:06):**  I can outsource it, but that doesn't necessarily work as easy as it sounds.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:32:11):**  I'm going to have to pay somebody to do it.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:32:14):**  If I want to do the podcast and get the gain out of it, if I want to do the fun part, then  
**[0:32:19-0:32:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:32:19):**  I have to bite my tongue and do the negative part.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:32:22):**  Really the negative part is a greater slice of the pie, the time pie, than the fun part.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:32:27):**  It's like sometimes you're just going to have to take the bad if you want the good.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:32:33):**  Most people don't know that going in.  
**[0:32:37-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:32:37):**  They might say, oh, I'll do it.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:32:39):**  Yeah, I'll do it.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:32:40):**  It's fine for a month or two months or three months, but nine months or two years into  
**[0:32:45-0:32:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:32:45):**  it, are you still wanting to eat that bad every day just to keep the good going?  
**[0:32:50-0:32:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:32:50):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:32:51):**  Now, I wanted to revisit another thing that you talked about earlier, how there are multiple  
**[0:32:55-0:33:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:32:55):**  forms of capital that you can get from a business venture and how money is just one of those.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:33:01):**  You've had the privilege of interviewing and learning directly from some of the biggest  
**[0:33:05-0:33:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:33:05):**  names and innovators in the world of permaculture.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:33:08):**  What have been some of the most important takeaways and lessons that you've learned  
**[0:33:11-0:33:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:33:11):**  from these people and maybe some other benefits that you've gotten even though the business  
**[0:33:16-0:33:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:33:16):**  didn't pan out the way you wanted?  
**[0:33:18-0:33:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:33:18):**  Okay, I'll do takeaways first, and then if I forget to get to the second part, just prompt  
**[0:33:24-0:33:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:33:24):**  me on that.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:33:25):**  Yeah, no worries.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:33:27):**  The big takeaways, just two of the ones I highlighted earlier, would be this is a continuum  
**[0:33:33-0:33:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:33:33):**  we're on.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:33:35):**  It's a process.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:33:36):**  That comes from Ethan Roland and Gregory Landaway.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:33:40):**  They both echo that.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:33:42):**  That is applicable to anything, landscapes, businesses, life.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:33:47):**  If you want to lose weight, if you want to get stronger, if you want to run faster, it's  
**[0:33:51-0:33:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:33:51):**  not going to happen tomorrow.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:33:52):**  It's going to be incremental changes, small, tiny incremental changes over a very long  
**[0:33:57-0:33:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:33:57):**  period of time.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:33:58):**  There's one big takeaway.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:34:00):**  The other idea that came out of somebody else who works for TerraGenesis with Ethan and  
**[0:34:05-0:34:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:34:05):**  Gregory, and I go to this every day, move in the direction of the most open doors.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:34:10):**  That's something Christian Shearer talks about.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:34:14):**  Give yourself optionality.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:34:16):**  The best plan is the plan that you can change easiest that has the most options with it.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:34:21):**  I love that is a takeaway.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:34:24):**  Curtis talks about this all the time, and I referenced this when I was talking about  
**[0:34:30-0:34:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:34:30):**  businesses.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:34:31):**  Put your ideology in your back pocket.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:34:33):**  Sometimes you don't need that ideology or you can't have that ideology to get to where  
**[0:34:38-0:34:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:34:38):**  you want to go, so you have to put it aside.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:34:41):**  That can be very hard for people that are new, people that are passionate to do.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:34:46):**  The Larry Santoyos, in which I talked about earlier, arrive at the solution.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:34:50):**  Don't impose the solution.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:34:51):**  Again, applicable to many things in life, relationships, raising kids, businesses.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:34:59):**  I think somebody like Stefan Subkowiak has shown that you have to be willing to have  
**[0:35:07-0:35:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:35:07):**  a long-term vision and put in the time.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:35:10):**  There were many years, many, many years, there was an eight-year period in there where he  
**[0:35:15-0:35:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:35:15):**  wanted to hang it up and throw it all away and just give up, but he persevered and got  
**[0:35:19-0:35:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:35:19):**  through it and made it through.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:35:23):**  There's been episodes that I've done on depression and alcoholism, real issues that people deal  
**[0:35:31-0:35:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:35:31):**  with.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:35:32):**  I think the takeaways from that is everybody is dealing with something.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:35:37):**  Everybody has some sort of issue.  
**[0:35:39-0:35:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:35:39):**  It's not always the fun stuff we all want to talk about or admit, even to ourselves,  
**[0:35:44-0:35:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:35:44):**  but there's people who can overcome these issues.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:35:49):**  So whether that's change on the landscape or change within us and our landscape, differences  
**[0:35:56-0:35:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:35:56):**  can be made dramatically.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:35:58):**  It just comes down to, do you want to put the work in?  
**[0:36:00-0:36:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:36:00):**  Do you want to believe in it?  
**[0:36:02-0:36:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:36:02):**  Can you last it out?  
**[0:36:06-0:36:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:36:06):**  Those are probably some of the initial ones that stick out.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:36:09):**  There's just been so many.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:36:11):**  The biggest macro theme of it all is, it's never easy.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:36:18):**  It's always going to be a lot of work, but there are people doing it.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:36:23):**  Odds are, if you want to do something in this space, there's someone out there successfully  
**[0:36:31-0:36:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:36:31):**  doing it and successfully doing it really, really well.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:36:36):**  What are they doing?  
**[0:36:38-0:36:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:36:38):**  Model them.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:36:39):**  And if it's not working for you, why isn't it working and how can you emulate them?  
**[0:36:45-0:36:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:36:45):**  Are you working as hard as they are?  
**[0:36:47-0:36:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:36:47):**  Are you doing the same things?  
**[0:36:48-0:36:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:36:48):**  Is something just different?  
**[0:36:51-0:37:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:36:51):**  So I've interviewed on the main show, let's say 220 people, probably some overlap in there.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:37:01):**  And these are people, in many cases, that didn't start out in this space.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:37:05):**  They came into it from other careers.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:37:07):**  They've transitioned in.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:37:09):**  They followed interests and found an opportunity to make it work.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:37:12):**  And some people are still trying to make it work out of those people that I've talked  
**[0:37:15-0:37:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:37:15):**  to.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:37:16):**  They don't know the right answer either.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:37:18):**  And what was the second part of that question?  
**[0:37:22-0:37:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:37:22):**  Oh, and what other benefits have you taken in forms other than money from the endeavors  
**[0:37:29-0:37:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:37:29):**  and the businesses that you've gotten into?  
**[0:37:34-0:37:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:37:34):**  If we think another lesson that came out of all this is the eight forms of capital and  
**[0:37:40-0:37:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:37:40):**  really becoming aware of that in many ways.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:37:43):**  One, what is it, meaning learning what it was from the people who created it, and also  
**[0:37:49-0:37:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:37:49):**  seeing how other people interpret it and apply it.  
**[0:37:54-0:37:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:37:54):**  And that's been how I've benefited.  
**[0:37:55-0:38:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:37:55):**  I've talked about this just recently because I'm four months out of employment, four months  
**[0:38:01-0:38:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:38:01):**  into self-employment now, total self-employment.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:38:06):**  And the work that I do going forward isn't coming out of the ether, isn't necessarily  
**[0:38:16-0:38:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:38:16):**  all new work.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:38:18):**  It's maybe new projects and new businesses.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:38:21):**  But it's new projects and new businesses that are built on a foundation that was built over  
**[0:38:25-0:38:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:38:25):**  the last three and a half or four years.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:38:28):**  I can do things now faster, start further ahead, start at a higher point because of  
**[0:38:38-0:38:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:38:38):**  work that I've put in previously.  
**[0:38:41-0:38:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:38:41):**  An example of that is like social capital.  
**[0:38:44-0:38:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:38:44):**  I've worked with a lot of people in the space.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:38:46):**  I have good relationships with a lot of people in the space.  
**[0:38:49-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:38:49):**  So if I need advice, if I need somebody to help promote, if I need somebody to give feedback  
**[0:38:56-0:39:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:38:56):**  or supply some sort of knowledge content, a lot of times that's just a text message  
**[0:39:02-0:39:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:39:02):**  away.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:39:04):**  And I couldn't have done that at day one.  
**[0:39:07-0:39:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:39:07):**  So if I think of the conference, again going back to that, the negative and all that, the  
**[0:39:12-0:39:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:39:12):**  one form of capital negative was finance.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:39:14):**  I lost money doing it and I didn't get paid for the time that I put in in dollars.  
**[0:39:21-0:39:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:39:21):**  But what did I get paid in?  
**[0:39:24-0:39:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:39:24):**  Relationships, that's within people within the space, that's learning how to deal with  
**[0:39:31-0:39:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:39:31):**  contractors.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:39:33):**  Over that same time, I learned everything about the web that I'm doing, how to do podcasting,  
**[0:39:41-0:39:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:39:41):**  that all came out of this.  
**[0:39:42-0:39:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:39:42):**  I've learned how to do bookkeeping for a business.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:39:45):**  I've learned everything else that comes with entrepreneurialism.  
**[0:39:48-0:39:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:39:48):**  I've learned how to manage myself, which is a big part of being an entrepreneur.  
**[0:39:56-0:40:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:39:56):**  It's largely a battle of you versus you, because there's going to be ups and downs.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:40:02):**  The ups are great, but the downs are what seems to hang around in our minds.  
**[0:40:06-0:40:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:40:06):**  And if you yourself can't handle those downs, you're going to tap out on you.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:40:13):**  So going through the negatives and seeing how I've gone through them has helped when  
**[0:40:20-0:40:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:40:20):**  I get new negatives.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:40:21):**  I bounce back quicker.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:40:23):**  I learn to risk assess and balance out those negatives so the bottoms aren't as deep anymore.  
**[0:40:33-0:40:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:40:33):**  And seeing a business fail has allowed me to do a post-mortem and say, why did it fail?  
**[0:40:38-0:40:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:40:38):**  Why did it not work?  
**[0:40:40-0:40:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:40:40):**  What could I have done differently?  
**[0:40:42-0:40:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:40:42):**  So naturally, now any new business venture I want to start, I look at what didn't work,  
**[0:40:48-0:40:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:40:48):**  what went wrong, and say, well, how can I avoid these things?  
**[0:40:52-0:40:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:40:52):**  And start stress testing these businesses.  
**[0:40:56-0:40:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:40:56):**  Where could they fall apart?  
**[0:40:58-0:40:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:40:58):**  What's the biggest risk?  
**[0:40:59-0:41:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:40:59):**  What's the amount of downside here?  
**[0:41:02-0:41:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:41:02):**  I learned how to manage money in all this, limit your capital risk.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:41:07):**  In many ways, the failure, like I said before, was good.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:41:14):**  And I'm not sure, and I'm really, I'll have to think a lot about this, but I'm not sure  
**[0:41:21-0:41:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:41:21):**  what would have happened if that would have been successful.  
**[0:41:26-0:41:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:41:26):**  Because I don't know that I would have learned these lessons, and might I have gone lottery  
**[0:41:31-0:41:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:41:31):**  winner and taken a gross misstep at some point in the future, not having learned these lessons,  
**[0:41:39-0:41:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:41:39):**  and really stepped into the Grand Canyon and blew it all up.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:41:44):**  I don't know.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:41:46):**  I think, and this doesn't mean everybody has to fail, but if you look at successful entrepreneurs  
**[0:41:52-0:41:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:41:52):**  or people that are successful in anything in life, there's a lot of failures in their  
**[0:41:56-0:41:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:41:56):**  wake.  
**[0:41:57-0:42:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:41:57):**  It's really those failures that have enabled them to move forward.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:42:03):**  So a takeaway from this too is something like Davin Bernakovich would say, fail forward.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:42:12):**  I look at the things I did in the past, and I try and look at the positives of them.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:42:20):**  Like I can't, what am I going to do focusing on how much money I lost on the event or why  
**[0:42:25-0:42:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:42:25):**  the business didn't work?  
**[0:42:26-0:42:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:42:26):**  All I can do is learn from it.  
**[0:42:28-0:42:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:42:28):**  If I obsess on it, if I get pissed on it, if I get sad on it, I get angry on it, that  
**[0:42:32-0:42:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:42:32):**  doesn't help me.  
**[0:42:33-0:42:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:42:33):**  So I just look at it objectively now and say, didn't work.  
**[0:42:36-0:42:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:42:36):**  Well, why didn't it work?  
**[0:42:38-0:42:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:42:38):**  What can I learn from it?  
**[0:42:39-0:42:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:42:39):**  Let's move forward here, and let's take all the wreckage that we have, like we're on Lost,  
**[0:42:45-0:42:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:42:45):**  and let's build something out of this and move forward.  
**[0:42:48-0:42:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:42:48):**  Yeah, that's a really great positive way of looking at what other people sometimes get  
**[0:42:53-0:42:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:42:53):**  down about when you call it failure or when you call it sort of a readjustment or things  
**[0:42:58-0:43:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:42:58):**  didn't work out the way you wanted.  
**[0:43:00-0:43:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:43:00):**  And I for one can say that I am really glad that you took on that business venture, even  
**[0:43:05-0:43:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:43:05):**  if it didn't work out the way you had wanted, because I know I have personally benefited  
**[0:43:09-0:43:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:43:09):**  a ton from the library of videos and tutorials and things from those conferences that are  
**[0:43:15-0:43:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:43:15):**  still available.  
**[0:43:16-0:43:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:43:16):**  Yeah, I mean, that's another benefit is like the conferences happened.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:43:22):**  So the content was made, the content was captured, the effect was put out there.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:43:30):**  Now really, I'm one of, let's say, a thousand people that were affected by this business.  
**[0:43:38-0:43:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:43:38):**  There was a thousand other people affected in some other way.  
**[0:43:42-0:43:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:43:42):**  So if we remove me from the equation, that's the other thing.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:43:46):**  I mean, this whole conversation has been me-centric, but this was an event that 650 people attended  
**[0:43:54-0:44:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:43:54):**  the first one, 650 people attended the second one, and like 250 people attended the third  
**[0:44:01-0:44:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:44:01):**  one.  
**[0:44:02-0:44:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:44:02):**  So those people all benefited in some positive or some negative way from this event.  
**[0:44:13-0:44:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:44:13):**  And I hear regularly, and maybe I only hear from the positives, that's probably the case,  
**[0:44:20-0:44:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:44:20):**  that they're benefiting from those events and those works.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:44:24):**  So I don't want to be a martyr, and I don't think anybody should, but it's hard for me  
**[0:44:30-0:44:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:44:30):**  to overlook that and say that that money was wasted.  
**[0:44:39-0:44:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:44:39):**  And I have trouble kind of rationalizing this in my head, but part of me looks at the loss  
**[0:44:47-0:44:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:44:47):**  and say, it was all worth it, because look at the change that was made.  
**[0:44:54-0:44:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:44:54):**  Look at what I learned.  
**[0:44:57-0:45:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:44:57):**  Now that loss wouldn't be sustainable forever, but I can't discount that.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:45:03):**  And I also had the opportunity to do something that not many people ever have the opportunity  
**[0:45:10-0:45:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:45:10):**  to do, and I'm thankful for that.  
**[0:45:13-0:45:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:45:13):**  Indeed.  
**[0:45:14-0:45:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:45:14):**  Well, I'm very grateful for what you were able to accomplish with the seminars and the  
**[0:45:18-0:45:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:45:18):**  conferences as well.  
**[0:45:20-0:45:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:45:20):**  So let me just change direction just for a moment here.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:45:23):**  Moving a little away from business, you've got your own land now, and you've been putting  
**[0:45:27-0:45:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:45:27):**  your time and your effort into building your own permaculture site.  
**[0:45:31-0:45:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:45:31):**  Now you're doing that with a young family, and I'm interested to know how that's affected  
**[0:45:35-0:45:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:45:35):**  your day-to-day life and your interactions with your children and with your family.  
**[0:45:40-0:45:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:45:40):**  Well, I'll give you an answer that's probably not going to be the answer people expect.  
**[0:45:43-0:45:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:45:43):**  Sometimes it's immensely stressful, and I think it hurts our relationships, because  
**[0:45:48-0:45:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:45:48):**  this...  
**[0:45:49-0:45:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:45:49):**  How so?  
**[0:45:51-0:45:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:45:51):**  If you have kids, if you ever have kids, or you're around other people that, they don't  
**[0:45:55-0:46:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:45:55):**  even have to be kids, that just aren't as educated or skilled up on what you're doing.  
**[0:46:01-0:46:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:46:01):**  It's like if I go back to me on that natural building site, I'm in their way.  
**[0:46:07-0:46:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:46:07):**  I don't really know what I'm doing.  
**[0:46:08-0:46:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:46:08):**  They're having to come back and redo the work that I'm doing or fix it, and that's frustrating.  
**[0:46:13-0:46:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:46:13):**  That's the same thing I experience when I have my kids involved.  
**[0:46:17-0:46:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:46:17):**  So the debate always internally is, do I go out there by myself and just work as fast  
**[0:46:26-0:46:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:46:26):**  as I can and get it done, knowing that I'm telling them that they can't come out and  
**[0:46:31-0:46:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:46:31):**  there's a cost to that, or they can't be around me, or I just got to get work done, or do  
**[0:46:36-0:46:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:46:36):**  I bring them out, have them help, and know for sure that the pace will be one-tenth of  
**[0:46:48-0:46:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:46:48):**  what it would be otherwise.  
**[0:46:49-0:46:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:46:49):**  The cost to that is, I'm frustrated, because work's not getting done.  
**[0:46:59-0:47:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:46:59):**  This is a hard thing to manage for me.  
**[0:47:05-0:47:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:47:05):**  Just now, when I want to make progress, I try and compartmentalize it and ask my wife,  
**[0:47:11-0:47:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:47:11):**  give me two hours where I can just go out, get the majority of the project done.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:47:15):**  Then they can come out, and by that point, the majority of the project's done, so if  
**[0:47:18-0:47:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:47:18):**  they slow me down at the end, I'm not so worried, because a lot of work has been done.  
**[0:47:24-0:47:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:47:24):**  It's also been a balance of time to dedicate to the project.  
**[0:47:33-0:47:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:47:33):**  For four months, I've been self-employed, working from home, and I've probably done  
**[0:47:38-0:47:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:47:38):**  more on the projects at home, outside, than I have done in the last four years, literally,  
**[0:47:46-0:47:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:47:46):**  because I now have the time to work on them.  
**[0:47:50-0:47:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:47:50):**  I don't know how I would have ever gotten done, what I got done in the last four months,  
**[0:47:54-0:47:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:47:54):**  if I was still working a full-time job and doing a business on the side.  
**[0:47:59-0:48:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:47:59):**  It just wouldn't have happened, because we all have the many things in life we're trying  
**[0:48:06-0:48:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:48:06):**  to balance, family, friends, personal interests, spiritual interests, main job, side hustle  
**[0:48:15-0:48:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:48:15):**  job, projects we want to do, projects we have to do.  
**[0:48:18-0:48:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:48:18):**  All those things call for our attention in a 24-hour day.  
**[0:48:23-0:48:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:48:23):**  How do you split it up?  
**[0:48:26-0:48:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:48:26):**  If you're saying yes to something, you're saying no to something else.  
**[0:48:29-0:48:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:48:29):**  Some days, if my wife's having a hard time, or the kids are having a rough day, but I  
**[0:48:37-0:48:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:48:37):**  had planned on doing work outside, it's just like there's no work getting done outside,  
**[0:48:42-0:48:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:48:42):**  so progress stalls.  
**[0:48:44-0:48:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:48:44):**  If I was single and lived alone, I'd probably be working, now that it's light out, 18 hours  
**[0:48:51-0:48:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:48:51):**  a day and getting a ton done.  
**[0:48:53-0:48:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:48:53):**  That's not my context.  
**[0:48:57-0:49:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:48:57):**  This has been a very hard pill to swallow over the last few years of having kids and  
**[0:49:03-0:49:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:49:03):**  having a property at the same time, is adjusting to the pace at which things move and being  
**[0:49:11-0:49:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:49:11):**  accepting of that pace.  
**[0:49:15-0:49:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:49:15):**  It's very hard, for me at least, to sit idle inside sometimes when it feels like I'm not  
**[0:49:23-0:49:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:49:23):**  doing anything, and I'm just watching the kids and they're playing, but I can't leave  
**[0:49:27-0:49:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:49:27):**  them alone because I have to make sure that they don't kill themselves inside.  
**[0:49:35-0:49:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:49:35):**  I want stuff to be happening outside at the same point.  
**[0:49:39-0:49:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:49:39):**  It's a constant balance.  
**[0:49:40-0:49:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:49:40):**  I feel like I'm getting better at it, but there's days still now where I get really  
**[0:49:45-0:49:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:49:45):**  frustrated to the point where I get cranky or anxious, like, I got to get something done.  
**[0:49:53-0:49:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:49:53):**  I don't feel like I'm getting any work done, but I'm doing what I have to do, or the work  
**[0:49:59-0:50:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:49:59):**  I'm getting done is required.  
**[0:50:02-0:50:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:50:02):**  It's just not necessarily the work maybe I want to get done.  
**[0:50:04-0:50:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:50:04):**  I'm changing diapers or watching kids, and that's all fun.  
**[0:50:07-0:50:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:50:07):**  I want to do it, but I can't just do that.  
**[0:50:12-0:50:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:50:12):**  That's well put.  
**[0:50:15-0:50:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:50:15):**  I like that perspective because, again, like we've covered so much in this podcast, it's  
**[0:50:20-0:50:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:50:20):**  the truth about the unglamorous portions and coming to terms with that and having realistic  
**[0:50:26-0:50:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:50:26):**  expectations that is going to give you a good idea of the amount of work and the amount  
**[0:50:30-0:50:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:50:30):**  of time that it takes to get these results that so many people want.  
**[0:50:35-0:50:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:50:35):**  That realistic expectations thing, that's a key point because this is something I see  
**[0:50:39-0:50:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:50:39):**  is a number one problem out there.  
**[0:50:42-0:50:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:50:42):**  People have unrealistic expectations, and they hold themselves to standards as though  
**[0:50:49-0:50:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:50:49):**  those expectations were realistic.  
**[0:50:52-0:50:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:50:52):**  They get upset about it, and they get angry about it.  
**[0:50:54-0:50:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:50:54):**  I see it all the time.  
**[0:50:57-0:51:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:50:57):**  Just because you want something to happen in a certain time frame and it doesn't happen  
**[0:51:02-0:51:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:51:02):**  in that time frame, if that was never realistic in the first place, but you had that expectation,  
**[0:51:09-0:51:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:51:09):**  should you have had it anyway?  
**[0:51:12-0:51:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:51:12):**  I really try and tell people, honestly, don't BS yourself realistic expectations.  
**[0:51:21-0:51:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:51:21):**  If you have many things happening in life and you think a project's going to get done  
**[0:51:27-0:51:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:51:27):**  in a week, expect it to get done, and be glad if it gets done in two weeks.  
**[0:51:34-0:51:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:51:34):**  Be glad if it gets done.  
**[0:51:35-0:51:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:51:35):**  So many people don't even get to that point.  
**[0:51:37-0:51:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:51:37):**  Exactly.  
**[0:51:38-0:51:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:51:38):**  Exactly.  
**[0:51:39-0:51:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:51:39):**  I appreciate your wins because I've taken on a lot of projects over the last few years,  
**[0:51:44-0:51:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:51:44):**  both in natural building and permaculture.  
**[0:51:48-0:51:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:51:48):**  Sometimes due to my own failings and sometimes due to circumstances outside of my control,  
**[0:51:53-0:51:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:51:53):**  things just don't work out.  
**[0:51:54-0:51:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:51:54):**  Things don't get completed, or they don't get completed the way that I would have wanted.  
**[0:51:59-0:52:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:51:59):**  Even if it took longer, even if it was a bit more expensive, I've definitely learned to  
**[0:52:04-0:52:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:52:04):**  count those wins and appreciate them when they do show up.  
**[0:52:07-0:52:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:52:07):**  That's the other thing there is when it gets done, but it doesn't get done how you wanted  
**[0:52:13-0:52:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:52:13):**  it to get done.  
**[0:52:14-0:52:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:52:14):**  Is that a check in the win box or is that a check in the loss box?  
**[0:52:19-0:52:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:52:19):**  Because it got done.  
**[0:52:21-0:52:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:52:21):**  Sometimes when you're busy and you're in a whirlwind of life, getting it done is good,  
**[0:52:27-0:52:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:52:27):**  but it's not how you want it, so you're kind of irked about it.  
**[0:52:31-0:52:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:52:31):**  Then a lot of times, a few months later, you look back and you don't even notice that it  
**[0:52:36-0:52:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:52:36):**  wasn't exactly how you wanted it.  
**[0:52:37-0:52:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:52:37):**  Yeah, and I think if you have the patience and the foresight to see any of those circumstances  
**[0:52:42-0:52:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:52:42):**  as a learning experience, I think that's sort of the most that you could hope to get out  
**[0:52:46-0:52:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:52:46):**  of it, other than the work that you've put in and the result.  
**[0:52:50-0:52:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:52:50):**  Right.  
**[0:52:51-0:52:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:52:51):**  You're dead on when you say, celebrate the wins, because I don't think people do that  
**[0:52:55-0:52:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:52:55):**  enough.  
**[0:52:56-0:53:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:52:56):**  Losses, I always say, will come at you every day all the time.  
**[0:53:00-0:53:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:53:00):**  We focus on those naturally.  
**[0:53:02-0:53:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:53:02):**  If you don't take time to celebrate the wins, big and small, the losses or the negatives  
**[0:53:08-0:53:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:53:08):**  are just going to take over.  
**[0:53:09-0:53:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:53:09):**  It's going to make it a much longer journey, and goodness knows it's a long enough journey  
**[0:53:13-0:53:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:53:13):**  as it is.  
**[0:53:14-0:53:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:53:14):**  Exactly, exactly.  
**[0:53:15-0:53:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:53:15):**  Tell me a little bit about some of the resources that have really helped you out in your own  
**[0:53:21-0:53:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:53:21):**  journey, either books or websites or anything else that's been a valuable asset to you.  
**[0:53:27-0:53:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:53:27):**  Probably the way I look at this is just-in-time learning.  
**[0:53:31-0:53:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:53:31):**  Learning as you need it, when you need it, on the spot.  
**[0:53:35-0:53:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:53:35):**  I think the natural approach, and this is the approach we learn in school, is read a  
**[0:53:41-0:53:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:53:41):**  bunch of stuff ahead of time and then learn it so then you'll go need it in the future  
**[0:53:46-0:53:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:53:46):**  at some point maybe.  
**[0:53:47-0:53:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:53:47):**  Well, I approach it just-in-time.  
**[0:53:50-0:53:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:53:50):**  If I need to learn something, I look it up.  
**[0:53:52-0:53:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:53:52):**  The biggest resources that help me with that just-in-time learning, they're going to be  
**[0:53:56-0:53:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:53:56):**  the obvious ones.  
**[0:53:59-0:54:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:53:59):**  Podcasts have been huge from an inspirational standpoint and a learning standpoint.  
**[0:54:07-0:54:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:54:07):**  Audio books, the publishing industry in general now around this space, there are so many books  
**[0:54:16-0:54:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:54:16):**  out there for things.  
**[0:54:19-0:54:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:54:19):**  Also the community.  
**[0:54:22-0:54:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:54:22):**  People within this movement, I think, generally want to share information, want to help people.  
**[0:54:32-0:54:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:54:32):**  If you are nice about how you ask, if you respect their time about how you ask, you  
**[0:54:37-0:54:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:54:37):**  can get a lot from them.  
**[0:54:40-0:54:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:54:40):**  That's the one that's most overlooked, I think, are the people.  
**[0:54:44-0:54:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:54:44):**  I think people are quick to Google it.  
**[0:54:47-0:54:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:54:47):**  People are maybe quick to ask an expert, be that Larry Santoyo or Jeff Lawton, and you  
**[0:54:52-0:54:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:54:52):**  realize, well, there's a lot of other people that are doing this on a day-to-day basis

**[0:55:06-0:55:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mepnotz2pcsc8rps8ldz157qqcou3d/#t=0:55:06):**  but I think younger people are reluctant to go seek out knowledge from them.

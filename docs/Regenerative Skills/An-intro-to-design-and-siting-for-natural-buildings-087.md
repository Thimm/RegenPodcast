**[0:03:01-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:03:01):**  Although many of these sighting and design techniques can apply to any type of building,  
**[0:03:06-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:03:06):**  the goal for us as natural builders is to integrate our structures into the landscape  
**[0:03:10-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:03:10):**  so that it functions with the ecosystem rather than trying to dominate it or just consume  
**[0:03:16-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:03:16):**  its resources.

**[0:04:03-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:04:03):**  And I don't mean just the average temperatures and the weather events that happen over a  
**[0:04:07-0:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:04:07):**  year span.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:04:08):**  You also want to take information on the most extreme weather events.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:04:13):**  Look into earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, whatever the most severe weather event that  
**[0:04:19-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:04:19):**  happens on your site might be.

**[0:04:24-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:04:24):**  You want to take into account the worst possible weather events especially because they're  
**[0:04:29-0:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:04:29):**  becoming more and more frequent with climate change every single year.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:04:34):**  One of the most common natural disasters to really affect people's buildings are floods.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:04:39):**  Floods cause more damage every year all around the world than all other natural disasters  
**[0:04:44-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:04:44):**  put together.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:04:45):**  Water rising and getting into your structures can do more damage than most shearing winds  
**[0:04:51-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:04:51):**  or even earthquakes.

**[0:05:04-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:05:04):**  can collect and stand for any period of time.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:05:08):**  From there you want to look at your orientation.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:05:11):**  This is your general north, south, east, west coordinates.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:05:15):**  This is going to determine how light travels over your site during different seasons.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:05:21):**  Now obviously the higher you are in latitude or lower you are in latitude for southern  
**[0:05:25-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:05:25):**  hemisphere the more that this is going to affect.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:05:28):**  The difference between the winter and the summer solstices and the arc that the sun  
**[0:05:34-0:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:05:34):**  has to travel over that site will affect the way that it warms or cools your house or other  
**[0:05:41-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:05:41):**  building that you have on site.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:05:44):**  There are many different resources online that you can find to calculate these things.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:05:48):**  If anybody is doing their designs on SketchUp there is a really great shadow calculator  
**[0:05:55-0:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:05:55):**  and as you put your renderings up it will show you the different paths during different  
**[0:05:59-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:05:59):**  times of the year and even different times of the day that the sun will be hitting your  
**[0:06:03-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:06:03):**  site and you can plan accordingly.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:06:06):**  Now this is especially useful if you want to make use of passive solar design techniques  
**[0:06:10-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:06:10):**  and use the sun's radiation throughout the day to help to evenly heat your house both  
**[0:06:15-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:06:15):**  during the night and during the day.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:06:18):**  The third bit of information on this list is elevation and there is a difference between  
**[0:06:23-0:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:06:23):**  absolute and relative elevation.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:06:26):**  Absolute elevation is the distance from sea level that you are and you know famously places

**[0:13:59-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:13:59):**  areas that were very heavily wooded.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:14:02):**  In this slide we show some of the traditional techniques from different areas around the

**[0:14:21-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:14:21):**  In the bottom left a waddle and daub technique with what looks to be bamboo used as the waddle

**[0:14:39-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:14:39):**  And then in the bottom right the slanted adobe brick assembling technique that is still used  
**[0:14:44-0:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:14:44):**  to this day to build what are often referred to as Nubian vaults.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:14:49):**  Now let's talk about siting.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:14:51):**  All of the information that you've gathered up until this point will help you to make  
**[0:14:55-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:14:55):**  the best decision of where to put your building.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:14:59):**  First I would urge people who are looking to do some sort of land based projects such  
**[0:15:04-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:15:04):**  as farming to put your house on the worst place on your site to do these things.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:15:11):**  Chances are unless you have a lot of land there are only a few sort of optimal places  
**[0:15:17-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:15:17):**  for not only sunlight but soil composition, irrigation potential and just general fertility  
**[0:15:25-0:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:15:25):**  on your site that would be ideal for these things.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:15:28):**  And if you go and put your house or your structure right in the middle of these areas you're  
**[0:15:33-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:15:33):**  going to severely limit the capacity of what you can produce on your site.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:15:38):**  In many places around the world traditionally people have built their houses in some of  
**[0:15:42-0:15:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:15:42):**  the most inhospitable areas of the land in order to make the best use of the arable land  
**[0:15:48-0:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:15:48):**  they have for agriculture and putting animals out to pasture.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:15:54):**  Another thing that I will repeat throughout this lecture is to think about the function  
**[0:15:58-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:15:58):**  of your building and make sure that the placement of your building is to the advantage of its  
**[0:16:03-0:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:16:03):**  function and of course the function being what you plan on using the space for.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:16:09):**  Now there are certain needs especially in houses between sleeping, cooking, sanitation  
**[0:16:15-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:16:15):**  and just general shelter that cannot be ignored.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:16:18):**  Those are necessities of your building but you may have other functions as well.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:16:23):**  If you work from home you may want an office space.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:16:26):**  If you're a musician or an artist of some type you may want a workshop or a music room.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:16:31):**  These are all the functions, the activities that will be going on within the structure  
**[0:16:35-0:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:16:35):**  that always should be considered whenever you're designing.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:16:39):**  Make sure first of all to build away from gullies and drainage areas.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:16:43):**  As I mentioned before water damage is one of the most costly and damaging natural disasters  
**[0:16:50-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:16:50):**  that can affect a structure.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:16:52):**  So make sure to be away from the path of water during especially severe weather events.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:16:59):**  Look especially for places where you can anchor easily into something hard and solid on your  
**[0:17:04-0:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:17:04):**  landscape especially if there's a severe weather and earthquakes are a significant risk in  
**[0:17:10-0:17:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:17:10):**  your area.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:17:12):**  This is also especially important if you're building on a very severe slope.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:17:17):**  Safety is not on your side on these severe angles and tying into something or anchoring  
**[0:17:22-0:17:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:17:22):**  into something solid in the landscape is the best way to make sure that the foundations  
**[0:17:28-0:17:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:17:28):**  will not have problems or might move away in any of these severe events I talked about.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:17:36):**  Know what you have available on your site and what advantages and challenges you're  
**[0:17:40-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:17:40):**  working for or working with.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:17:43):**  At this point you want to sort of do an inventory of what you have on your site.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:17:48):**  So let's start by getting the idea that there is a perfect site out there just out of your  
**[0:17:52-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:17:52):**  mind.  
**[0:17:54-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:17:54):**  It doesn't exist.  
**[0:17:55-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:17:55):**  I've looked, I've talked to a lot of people, every single site has some sort of challenge  
**[0:18:01-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:18:01):**  either too little water or too much water, too much of a slant or possibly too flat.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:18:07):**  It really is just a matter of what you're trying to accomplish and if you're able to  
**[0:18:11-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:18:11):**  do that on your site, if you're not able at all, you have to look for somewhere else.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:18:16):**  But every place you go you're going to have to accommodate some sort of factors, some  
**[0:18:20-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:18:20):**  sort of criteria that maybe are not ideal for what you're trying to accomplish and you  
**[0:18:25-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:18:25):**  have to work around them or find a way of transforming those problems into solutions.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:18:33):**  Every resource on your site can become a disadvantage if managed poorly.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:18:38):**  So for example, if you need water on site to irrigate plants or even just to turn into  
**[0:18:43-0:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:18:43):**  potable water for sanitation and drinking, that's great if you've got a spring on site.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:18:49):**  But if you're in a drainage gully or if you're in an area that suddenly gets inundated in  
**[0:18:53-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:18:53):**  very very heavy rains, too much water, especially if it's planned through drainage routes and  
**[0:19:00-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:19:00):**  canals on site in an area that could really affect negatively what you've been trying  
**[0:19:05-0:19:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:19:05):**  to do with it, either planting a garden, setting your foundations for your home or whatever,  
**[0:19:11-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:19:11):**  can quickly become a really big issue.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:19:14):**  And this is all about managing those resources.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:19:17):**  You may want to live in a forest where there's a lot of trees and a lot of lumber as a building  
**[0:19:22-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:19:22):**  resource, but if it shades out your place in an already cold area and you just never  
**[0:19:28-0:19:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:19:28):**  get direct sunlight, that could also be a disadvantage.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:19:33):**  Selective pruning and chopping down of a couple of trees to make sure that you get the sunlight  
**[0:19:38-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:19:38):**  and possibly the solar gain to help to heat your space can be an advantage, but you're  
**[0:19:46-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:19:46):**  going to need to manage it correctly.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:19:49):**  The other thing I would say is don't go into a project with an agenda.  
**[0:19:54-0:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:19:54):**  You're much more able to adapt to your place if you don't come in with preconceived notions.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:20:00):**  The story that I like to give on this is I had an apprentice about a year and a half  
**[0:20:04-0:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:20:04):**  ago who went to a conference here on Lake Atitlan and was listening to a talk by a Super  
**[0:20:10-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:20:10):**  Adobe builder.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:20:11):**  Now Super Adobe has tons of advantages and this guy was talking all about them about  
**[0:20:15-0:20:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:20:15):**  how it can basically solve all your problems and is the best way to build.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:20:20):**  And by the end of the talk, he left by saying, but unfortunately on my site, we just have  
**[0:20:26-0:20:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:20:26):**  really rocky soil and I'm not sure how we're going to get the clay soil we need to make  
**[0:20:31-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:20:31):**  Super Adobe.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:20:33):**  Now if any of you are kind of going up with red flags at this statement, you're not alone.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:20:39):**  If you have a whole bunch of rocks on your site, perhaps building with clay soil is not  
**[0:20:44-0:20:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:20:44):**  the best idea.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:20:46):**  If you have a great resource such as stones, you should think about using those in your  
**[0:20:51-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:20:51):**  building as much as possible.  
**[0:20:54-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:20:54):**  If you go into a site with preconceived notions, what I often say is the man with a hammer  
**[0:21:00-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:21:00):**  sees a world full of nails.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:21:02):**  You go in there seeing solutions without fully understanding the problem.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:21:06):**  So try and maintain an open mind and try and work with the resources and the conditions  
**[0:21:12-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:21:12):**  that you have on your site to best solve your problems.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:21:16):**  Think about now what are some of the sectors that would need to be designed around in your

**[0:21:27-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:21:27):**  you like to live?  
**[0:21:28-0:21:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:21:28):**  What are perhaps some of the factors that you would need to accommodate in your design  
**[0:21:32-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:21:32):**  so that they don't become disadvantages or challenges?  
**[0:21:37-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:21:37):**  Now who among you listening already has a project in mind?  
**[0:21:41-0:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:21:41):**  Do any of you know what you want to build in the future?  
**[0:21:45-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:21:45):**  Let's go over some of the common design techniques that have become really popular, especially  
**[0:21:51-0:21:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:21:51):**  in the natural building world.  
**[0:21:53-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:21:53):**  And I'll go over four sort of very quickly just to hopefully inspire some new design  
**[0:22:01-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:22:01):**  ideas and those of you who are listening and maybe you can consider implementing some or  
**[0:22:07-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:22:07):**  all of the design techniques in these into a building you're considering implementing  
**[0:22:13-0:22:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:22:13):**  yourself.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:22:14):**  So the four that I'll go over are earthships, geodesic domes, passive solar design techniques,  
**[0:22:22-0:22:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:22:22):**  and Wofates slash earth integrated houses.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:22:25):**  Some of you may already know these by name and these might be new to a few of you listeners  
**[0:22:30-0:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:22:30):**  out there as well.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:22:32):**  So let's talk first about passive solar design techniques.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:22:35):**  The illustrations in the presentation here are going to be really useful.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:22:40):**  So if you haven't already downloaded the PDF file of this presentation, I really recommend  
**[0:22:44-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:22:44):**  that you take a look at it because this will make a lot more sense with the illustrations.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:22:49):**  Now passive solar design techniques are not at all unique to natural buildings.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:22:54):**  In fact they're becoming more and more common all the time in industrial buildings as well  
**[0:22:58-0:23:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:22:58):**  because it just makes sense to take advantage of the free solar energy that we all get,  
**[0:23:04-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:23:04):**  well pretty much all of us get, in order to cut down on the imported energy to create  
**[0:23:10-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:23:10):**  a comfortable home environment in most places around the world.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:23:16):**  Now a lot of the other design techniques that I'll be going over after this include passive  
**[0:23:20-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:23:20):**  solar design in part or as a keystone of their design techniques.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:23:25):**  So let's go over how you can take advantage of solar energy through different seasons.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:23:31):**  Now the sun follows a different trajectory.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:23:34):**  The further you are up in latitude or down in latitude away from the equator, you'll  
**[0:23:39-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:23:39):**  have a more severe difference between winter sun and summer sun.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:23:44):**  Summer sun tends to stay in the air quite a bit longer, following a higher arc overhead  
**[0:23:50-0:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:23:50):**  and shining directly down in the height of the season.  
**[0:23:55-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:23:55):**  Now in winter the days are shorter and the sun is likely not to rise quite as high in  
**[0:24:00-0:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:24:00):**  the sky, bringing in more of a slanted or indirect solar pattern coming across from  
**[0:24:10-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:24:10):**  the sky.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:24:11):**  Now you can leverage this to your advantage, seen as most people want to have more sunlight,  
**[0:24:17-0:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:24:17):**  especially during the winter months, in order to warm themselves and their spaces.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:24:21):**  Whereas in the summertime you want to keep that out of your space so that your home or  
**[0:24:26-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:24:26):**  other building doesn't overheat.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:24:29):**  And you can leverage this with the overhangs on your roof or by selectively letting in  
**[0:24:35-0:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:24:35):**  sunlight coming from different angles.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:24:38):**  So with the overhang on the roof you can make sure that the high sun in the summertime is  
**[0:24:43-0:24:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:24:43):**  shaded away from windows and doors and other transparent openings in your house during  
**[0:24:49-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:24:49):**  the high summer months so that the interior stays shaded and much cooler.  
**[0:24:54-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:24:54):**  And as the sun has more of a slanted and less direct trajectory in the wintertime, those  
**[0:25:00-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:25:00):**  overhangs on your roof or the selective shading on your house allow that to come in from a  
**[0:25:06-0:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:25:06):**  more severe angle and get indoors where it can potentially warm up some sort of thermal  
**[0:25:12-0:25:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:25:12):**  mass that gets charged with sunlight during the day and releases it slowly during the  
**[0:25:18-0:25:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:25:18):**  night in order to help to regulate the interior temperature of the space without having to  
**[0:25:23-0:25:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:25:23):**  bring in imported energy or burning fossil fuels.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:25:27):**  The illustrations on this presentation will show different ways how you can utilize that  
**[0:25:33-0:25:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:25:33):**  in various floor plans.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:25:34):**  The most simple one being in the top left.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:25:37):**  A more complex and intricate design utilizing passive solar techniques in the right hand  
**[0:25:44-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:25:44):**  side.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:25:45):**  And a picture of a beautiful simple building in a snowy climate oriented towards the sun  
**[0:25:51-0:25:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:25:51):**  but with overhangs on the roofs that selectively allow in different sunlight based on the trajectory  
**[0:25:58-0:25:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:25:58):**  and the change of the seasons.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:25:59):**  I hope this makes sense.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:26:01):**  Definitely check out the presentation for the illustrations if it doesn't.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:26:06):**  Now let's talk about earthships.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:26:08):**  This is a very common, I would say pedagogy within the natural building world and became  
**[0:26:15-0:26:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:26:15):**  most popular especially in the area around Taos, New Mexico where this design was originally  
**[0:26:24-0:26:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:26:24):**  sort of founded.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:26:27):**  Earthships have since really caught on in popularity partly because of the beautiful  
**[0:26:33-0:26:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:26:33):**  integration of sort of greenhouse space oriented along the passive solar gain.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:26:40):**  Well in northern New Mexico where this technique was sort of founded they're orienting it southward  
**[0:26:47-0:26:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:26:47):**  where you get the most solar gain.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:26:50):**  And earthships are usually characterized by the style of having a long house with maximum  
**[0:26:56-0:27:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:26:56):**  solar orientation where they can take in the sunlight and use it to heat the space to grow  
**[0:27:03-0:27:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:27:03):**  crops and work in a whole other type of we would call appropriate technology so that  
**[0:27:11-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:27:11):**  living space is as self-sufficient as possible.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:27:15):**  They also use a bunch of other techniques which I'm a little hesitant to advocate for.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:27:24):**  Ramming tires for thermal mass in the back walls of a house and earth-burming it at the  
**[0:27:30-0:27:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:27:30):**  back definitely has some advantages by taking or making the best use of the constant heat  
**[0:27:37-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:27:37):**  of the earth or the thermal temperature to help to regulate the inside of the building  
**[0:27:43-0:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:27:43):**  by tapping into the ground.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:27:47):**  Ramming those tires I understand is meant to be sort of a recycling technique and upcycling  
**[0:27:54-0:27:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:27:54):**  old tires which no longer have a useful life on the road and ramming them with earth in  
**[0:27:59-0:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:27:59):**  order to turn them into a thermal mass bank at the back of the house that can store heat  
**[0:28:04-0:28:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:28:04):**  or cold based on how you're trying to regulate the temperature of the interior space.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:28:11):**  Now from experience I know that this can be a ton of work and tires can be quite unsightly  
**[0:28:19-0:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:28:19):**  and difficult to work with seen as a lot of them have exposed wires from being torn up  
**[0:28:24-0:28:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:28:24):**  on the road.

**[0:28:31-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:28:31):**  the same thing and I just think that it's a whole lot of extra work for sort of the  
**[0:28:39-0:28:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:28:39):**  purpose that it serves in the building.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:28:41):**  However I'm really in favor of the way that they have integrated many different types  
**[0:28:46-0:28:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:28:46):**  of appropriate technology such as rainwater harvesting, solar panels or windmills for  
**[0:28:53-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:28:53):**  electricity generation, graywater recycling techniques, growing food inside of your house.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:28:59):**  I think all of these are brilliant.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:29:01):**  Now they were all sort of founded independently of earthships so you can integrate any of  
**[0:29:06-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:29:06):**  these types of technologies into whatever house that you have.

**[0:29:15-0:29:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:29:15):**  very self-sufficient home units.

**[0:29:24-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:29:24):**  as originally they used a whole lot of cement but you know nothing's perfect and I encourage  
**[0:29:32-0:29:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:29:32):**  everyone to do the best with the resources that they have on hand.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:29:36):**  However the one thing that I am a little bit wary of with earthships is that when people  
**[0:29:41-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:29:41):**  get really excited about a particular pedagogy they tend to think that it's the solution  
**[0:29:46-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:29:46):**  for everything and I have heard of and seen earthships built all over the world.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:29:51):**  Now this very particular design methodology worked very well in northern New Mexico around  
**[0:29:58-0:30:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:29:58):**  the Taos area where I worked significantly during part of my natural building apprenticeship  
**[0:30:05-0:30:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:30:05):**  so I understand the climate fairly well.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:30:08):**  The major swings in temperature are well accommodated with the design style of earthships in that

**[0:30:19-0:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:30:19):**  significantly different climate you have to significantly amend the design to accommodate

**[0:30:41-0:30:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:30:41):**  carefully into how you would sort of accommodate the differences in climate into the design  
**[0:30:46-0:30:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:30:46):**  of that building.

**[0:31:37-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:31:37):**  pioneered this idea of building homes into a hillside or into a piece of earth which  
**[0:31:45-0:31:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:31:45):**  admittedly has been done for millennia.

**[0:31:59-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:31:59):**  Look at the bottom and how water runs away from the building in this context now if you

**[0:32:17-0:32:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:32:17):**  seep through and cause all sorts of humidity and mold problems within the building.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:32:24):**  Now by flipping it the other way around and digging a significant portion out of the hillside

**[0:32:36-0:32:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:32:36):**  with the hillside you solve so many of those water problems and it no longer butts up against  
**[0:32:42-0:32:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:32:42):**  the structure where it could cause damage to the building itself.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:32:47):**  I've seen very very simple designs of this and I've seen very ornate and complex ones.  
**[0:32:54-0:32:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:32:54):**  The main thing to know that if it's designed correctly and oriented correctly with solar

**[0:33:50-0:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:33:50):**  Now this is another design criteria or design style that I do not have personal experience

**[0:34:44-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:34:44):**  One of the biggest advantages of these geodesic domes is that they're built with a combination

**[0:35:19-0:35:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-an-intro-to-design-and-siting-for-natural-buildings-087/#t=0:35:19):**  very sturdy structure and a minimal amount of surface area to volume ratio.

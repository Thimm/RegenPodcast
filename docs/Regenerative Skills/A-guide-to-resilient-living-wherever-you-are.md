**[0:01:16-0:01:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:01:16):**  I hope you're doing well.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:01:17):**  This week we'll be wrapping up this series on modern homesteading by reviewing some of  
**[0:01:21-0:01:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:01:21):**  the most important information from the last seven interviews.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:01:24):**  In those episodes we covered a ton of exciting topics from some of the best authorities in  
**[0:01:28-0:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:01:28):**  their field from animal husbandry, becoming self-sufficient by living off your land, mythbusting,  
**[0:01:34-0:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:01:34):**  small enterprise planning, making money on your homestead, and so much more.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:01:38):**  I'll also be giving some advice and observations from my own experience living and working  
**[0:01:43-0:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:01:43):**  on homesteading projects and starting my own homesteads all over the world in the last  
**[0:01:47-0:01:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:01:47):**  15 years.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:01:49):**  What's more is that I've just published a new ebook all about homesteading and resilient  
**[0:01:53-0:01:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:01:53):**  living titled Homesteading for Every Home that you can now download on the website for  
**[0:01:58-0:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:01:58):**  free and you can use it to plan your own homestead and start building a profitable land-based  
**[0:02:03-0:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:02:03):**  business right away.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:02:05):**  Both in this episode and in the ebook I'll be talking about what modern homesteading  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:02:09):**  actually is, how it looks in different configurations, how you can start taking your first step towards  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:02:14):**  a homesteading lifestyle even when you're living in a tiny apartment in the city, and  
**[0:02:19-0:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:02:19):**  what it means to work towards self-sufficiency and advice from my experience homesteading  
**[0:02:23-0:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:02:23):**  in foreign countries and what the advantages and disadvantages are.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:02:27):**  Now let's get real for a minute here first.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:02:29):**  As COVID-19 pandemic continues to develop, people all over the world are waking up simultaneously  
**[0:02:35-0:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:02:35):**  to the fragility of our global economy and our so-called safety nets.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:02:40):**  I've seen a dramatic increase in articles, videos, blogs, and online education about  
**[0:02:44-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:02:44):**  things like growing grown food, providing your own needs at home, starting a small business  
**[0:02:49-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:02:49):**  for independent income, natural medicines, and a lot more in just the last few weeks.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:02:55):**  Many of us are also just now realizing that our work is considered non-essential and therefore  
**[0:03:00-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:03:00):**  our jobs and our livelihoods are now at risk.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:03:03):**  While this may be just a temporary shutdown and there's still a chance that things will  
**[0:03:07-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:03:07):**  resume much the way that they were before the social distancing measures, it's also  
**[0:03:11-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:03:11):**  quite likely that there will be some major changes and adjustments ahead.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:03:16):**  We have all been alerted to how much our world and our lives are outside of our control and  
**[0:03:21-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:03:21):**  being influenced by factors that are inherently unstable.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:03:25):**  Over the span of our lives so many of us have been seduced into a promise of luxury, convenience,  
**[0:03:30-0:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:03:30):**  and an abundance of options by things like low prices and ease of access to products  
**[0:03:35-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:03:35):**  and services that have separated us from our own self-reliance.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:03:39):**  These things, while not inherently bad, are the mechanisms by which we let go of our autonomy  
**[0:03:44-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:03:44):**  and interconnectedness between the people around us and in our communities.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:03:49):**  The more we outsource our needs, wants, and aspirations to an economy that profits off  
**[0:03:53-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:03:53):**  our desire not to lift a finger or to save time, we begin to lose the skills and knowledge  
**[0:03:59-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:03:59):**  that would help us reclaim our self-reliance.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:04:02):**  We now find ourselves at a point in which many of us are hyper-competent at very specific  
**[0:04:06-0:04:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:04:06):**  skill sets and narrow focuses or disciplines for the sake of productivity or efficiency,  
**[0:04:11-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:04:11):**  but we've lost the simple skills that previous generations relied upon for their daily needs  
**[0:04:16-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:04:16):**  and well-being.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:04:17):**  This is even more pronounced in my generation and people younger than me because so many  
**[0:04:23-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:04:23):**  of us grew up with technologies that we take for granted and that have redefined how we  
**[0:04:27-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:04:27):**  do everything from how we cook to how we communicate.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:04:31):**  It can be so easy to forget that life went on just fine without all the tools and gadgets  
**[0:04:35-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:04:35):**  that we've outsourced so much of our thinking and our entertainment to.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:04:39):**  That's why in this episode we'll explore some of the most actionable information about homesteading  
**[0:04:43-0:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:04:43):**  and self-sufficient living that I gathered from the last interviews in this series, as  
**[0:04:47-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:04:47):**  well as adding some of my own learning and experience from designing and working on various  
**[0:04:51-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:04:51):**  homestead projects around the world.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:04:53):**  While there are tons of voices online right now talking about homesteading and self-reliance  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:04:57):**  planning that range from keeping hobby chickens in an urban backyard all the way to prepping  
**[0:05:02-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:05:02):**  for the apocalypse in a hidden bunker, this episode was made to give you an idea of the  
**[0:05:07-0:05:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:05:07):**  wide range of options out there all in one place, with links to explore the ones that  
**[0:05:12-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:05:12):**  best suit your personal goals and your context.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:05:16):**  The ideas and advice here come from real people who are living the solutions they endorse.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:05:20):**  What's more, all of the options presented here are designed to work towards environmental  
**[0:05:24-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:05:24):**  restoration and health at the same time.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:05:29):**  So whether you're still going about your daily life as normal or you're sheltering in place  
**[0:05:33-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:05:33):**  in a cramped apartment with no income, all of us can use this time to take stock of our  
**[0:05:38-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:05:38):**  lives and support systems to assess what we can be doing to build resilience in the connections  
**[0:05:42-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:05:42):**  that support us, our loved ones, and of course our communities.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:05:46):**  The alternative right now is to miss out on this unprecedented opportunity for positive  
**[0:05:50-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:05:50):**  change and leave ourselves vulnerable to further disruption and insecurity when the next emergency  
**[0:05:56-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:05:56):**  inevitably arrives.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:05:58):**  Now is the time to take steps towards creating an abundant, regenerative, and secure future  
**[0:06:03-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:06:03):**  for yourself and your community.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:06:06):**  While everyone's context is different and many of the solutions presented here will  
**[0:06:09-0:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:06:09):**  not be correct for your personal goals, many of them will.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:06:13):**  And it's up to you to decide your future in these uncertain times.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:06:17):**  The actions that you take today will determine how resilient you and your community will  
**[0:06:21-0:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:06:21):**  be as we collectively transition out of this pandemic.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:06:26):**  So with all of that said, let's start from the beginning.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:06:30):**  So homesteading is a term that originates from the homesteading acts in the United States.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:06:35):**  These were no small events, they had a huge impact on the western territories of the USA  
**[0:06:40-0:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:06:40):**  and of the native people who lived there.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:06:43):**  In all, more than 160 million acres of public land and nearly 10% of the total area of the  
**[0:06:49-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:06:49):**  United States was given away for free to 1.6 million homesteaders.  
**[0:06:55-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:06:55):**  Now the first act was declared in 1962 and allowed an adult to claim a parcel of land  
**[0:07:01-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:07:01):**  of 160 acres if they were willing to settle and farm that land.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:07:06):**  The revolutionary part of this act was that it applied to any citizen over 21 years of  
**[0:07:11-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:07:11):**  age and it also included women and migrants who had applied for citizenship.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:07:16):**  Later after the passage of the 14th amendment, which came in 1968 after the civil war, it  
**[0:07:21-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:07:21):**  also included freed slaves.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:07:24):**  There were many extensions and complementary acts that followed, including one that I think  
**[0:07:29-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:07:29):**  is pretty interesting.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:07:30):**  The enlarged homestead act of 1909 increased the available land for a homestead claimant  
**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:07:35):**  to 320 acres in areas considered marginal land.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:07:40):**  This was specifically for the great plains region where rainfall is low and the large  
**[0:07:44-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:07:44):**  expanse of flatlands are really hard to irrigate.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:07:48):**  This directly led to a massive influx of farmers to the area who had little to no knowledge  
**[0:07:54-0:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:07:54):**  of the ecology of the native savannah there and in a short time due to destructive tillage  
**[0:07:59-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:07:59):**  they created the conditions that led to the dust bowl of the 1930s.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:08:05):**  So let's talk about modern homesteading which is obviously pretty different.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:08:09):**  Modern homesteading looks really different from what it looked like between the 1860s  
**[0:08:13-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:08:13):**  to the 1930s in that most people tend to be on much less land and it's a term that can  
**[0:08:17-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:08:17):**  apply to a wide configuration of lifestyles from dense urban settings to remote wilderness  
**[0:08:23-0:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:08:23):**  living.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:08:24):**  The main commonality I've found in homestead households is that they're trying to achieve  
**[0:08:27-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:08:27):**  some level of self-sufficiency.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:08:31):**  Obviously the amount of autonomy that someone can achieve is limited by a number of factors  
**[0:08:35-0:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:08:35):**  and at the end of the day almost no one will be fully self-sufficient.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:08:39):**  Most people I've found, as well as the homesteading and ecological farming projects that I've  
**[0:08:43-0:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:08:43):**  worked with in the past, tend to focus mostly on producing their own food and earning enough  
**[0:08:48-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:08:48):**  money to live comfortably and continue to invest in improvements on their property.  
**[0:08:52-0:09:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:08:52):**  Yeah, so our number one goal in this transition is to have most of the resources for our family  
**[0:09:02-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:09:02):**  under control.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:09:03):**  So food, that goes from chickens, pigs, sheep, cattle to some fish and all the plant, both  
**[0:09:12-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:09:12):**  garden, both perennial food forest and also standard annual production.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:09:18):**  Now this can look a lot different for people who live in urban settings though and the  
**[0:09:22-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:09:22):**  goal there might not be to produce all their own food but rather to reduce their dependence  
**[0:09:26-0:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:09:26):**  on sourcing from supermarkets and saving money by buying directly from farmers or preserving  
**[0:09:32-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:09:32):**  bulk purchases at home among many other things.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:09:36):**  While most homesteaders are motivated to live more independent lives, it's not always based  
**[0:09:40-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:09:40):**  around working the land as a primary source of income.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:09:44):**  And taking steps towards self-sufficiency is also becoming a popular hobby as more people  
**[0:09:48-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:09:48):**  are learning about the joys and rewards of keeping small farm animals, growing gardens  
**[0:09:53-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:09:53):**  and canning or fermenting food just for fun or to save a bit of money.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:09:57):**  The great part about many of these projects is that they have many benefits for your life  
**[0:10:01-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:10:01):**  as well as your community.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:10:04):**  So most of this series I've spoken to people who are living on many acres of land and have  
**[0:10:09-0:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:10:09):**  the space for large gardens and big animals but since so many of us, myself included at  
**[0:10:14-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:10:14):**  the moment, are working with much smaller spaces, I wanted to talk about all of the  
**[0:10:18-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:10:18):**  options still available to people in apartments, condos or even just urban or suburban homes  
**[0:10:23-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:10:23):**  with tiny yards.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:10:25):**  There are still tons of ways that you can build a resilient and more independent lifestyle  
**[0:10:29-0:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:10:29):**  from these small living spaces.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:10:31):**  You can even turn many of these projects into small businesses if you're willing to dedicate  
**[0:10:34-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:10:34):**  the time to it.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:10:36):**  Now from my own experience living in many different settings, I've often thought that  
**[0:10:40-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:10:40):**  homesteading is a state of mind more than anything else.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:10:43):**  A state of mind that looks critically at the way that we provide for our needs and the  
**[0:10:47-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:10:47):**  industries and practices that we support in doing so.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:10:51):**  Taking back some control, however small, is a way to increase our options.  
**[0:10:55-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:10:55):**  And I find it's difficult to take any moral stance against modern society when your food,  
**[0:11:00-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:11:00):**  shelter, water, transportation, entertainment and energy sources all come from sources that  
**[0:11:06-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:11:06):**  are in contradiction to your ethics.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:11:09):**  By moving towards independence in these areas, you can oppose the practices that you don't  
**[0:11:13-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:11:13):**  agree with much more effectively by simply not depending on them.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:11:18):**  Regardless of what your political and ideological views are, I don't know of anyone who wants  
**[0:11:22-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:11:22):**  to drink contaminated water.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:11:25):**  You don't have to be a vegan activist to think that abused and malnourished animals  
**[0:11:28-0:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:11:28):**  make for lousy meat, milk or eggs.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:11:31):**  You don't have to be a tree-hugging hippie to see how massive deforestation has degraded  
**[0:11:35-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:11:35):**  our land and soils.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:11:37):**  In fact, many of the loudest voices that scream vitriol on television and social media for  
**[0:11:42-0:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:11:42):**  their causes come from people who are completely dependent on the industries and practices  
**[0:11:47-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:11:47):**  for their way of life.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:11:50):**  Modern homesteading to me has always been about waking up to the fact that humans have  
**[0:11:53-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:11:53):**  lived healthy, productive, meaningful and happy lives without these greedy corporations  
**[0:11:58-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:11:58):**  and destructive policies for much longer than we've lived with them.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:12:03):**  And that moving back to a lifestyle dependent on your home economy and your local community  
**[0:12:08-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:12:08):**  is not only more rewarding, it can also be a lot safer, as so many of us are learning  
**[0:12:13-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:12:13):**  now.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:12:15):**  So now let's talk about what homesteading can look like in different settings and property  
**[0:12:19-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:12:19):**  situations.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:12:20):**  While having a lot of land and a big budget is certainly an advantage when it comes to  
**[0:12:24-0:12:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:12:24):**  certain aspects of self-sufficiency like food production, I've often found that some of  
**[0:12:28-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:12:28):**  the most inventive and ingenious ideas have come from people living in the smallest spaces  
**[0:12:33-0:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:12:33):**  and who are working with almost no budget.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:12:36):**  Like with many design challenges, having creative constraints can put you to come up with solutions  
**[0:12:41-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:12:41):**  that you might not have thought of if you add more money or space to compensate for  
**[0:12:45-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:12:45):**  your mistakes.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:12:46):**  Now I've compiled a list of some of many of the projects that homesteaders have pioneered  
**[0:12:52-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:12:52):**  to build resiliency in their homes and communities, and I've organized it by projects that apply  
**[0:12:57-0:13:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:12:57):**  to whatever living situation you might be in right now.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:13:00):**  And so because I think it's so relevant to so many people's experience at this moment  
**[0:13:04-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:13:04):**  if you're in lockdown or social distancing and you're in a small space, let me go over  
**[0:13:08-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:13:08):**  some of my favorite ideas of things that you can do from an apartment or a condominium.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:13:14):**  So let's start by gardening options.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:13:17):**  You can grow sprouts and microgreens in your home.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:13:20):**  The sprouts don't need any sunlight, so if you haven't even got a sunny window you can  
**[0:13:24-0:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:13:24):**  still grow wonderful delicious sprouts.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:13:26):**  I do this at my home all the time.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:13:29):**  Microgreens are a little bit different.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:13:30):**  They will need some sun after a while, but putting them in a windowsill works great.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:13:35):**  Which leads to window or balcony herb gardens, and these are very very easy to manage.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:13:42):**  And the microclimate, the little controlled climate inside of your apartment or condo  
**[0:13:45-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:13:45):**  is perfect for growing some of these things, which otherwise are very expensive to buy.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:13:51):**  You can also do some indoor mushroom growing.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:13:54):**  This definitely doesn't need any light, in fact it's better without it.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:13:57):**  You can do this even in a small closet, underneath your stairs, or any kind of place where you  
**[0:14:03-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:14:03):**  can control the humidity.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:14:06):**  Different types of mushrooms can be easier or more difficult to grow, but really easy  
**[0:14:10-0:14:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:14:10):**  ones to start with are oyster mushrooms.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:14:13):**  You can also do small aquaponic or hydroponic growing.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:14:17):**  This is one of those things that I could go on for a long time about, but if you look  
**[0:14:20-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:14:20):**  it up online there are great resources on how to get started.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:14:24):**  Anybody can save seeds from the veggies that you either grow or buy from the store.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:14:29):**  Not all of them are viable if they come from hybrid breeds and it's worth looking up  
**[0:14:33-0:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:14:33):**  a little bit as to what sort of seeds are easiest to grow from the things that you buy  
**[0:14:39-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:14:39):**  normally, but this is another great option.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:14:42):**  You can also use worms to turn your food waste into vermicompost.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:14:45):**  I do this at home as well.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:14:47):**  And for those of you who really want to get outside or are able to get outside, you can  
**[0:14:51-0:14:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:14:51):**  apply for a community garden or borrow a neighbor's land.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:14:54):**  Again, I'm doing that right now too.  
**[0:14:56-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:14:56):**  There's a neighbor just up the way, maybe about a 10 minute walk from here, who's  
**[0:14:59-0:15:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:14:59):**  given us a space in her hazelnut orchard and I've been growing all kinds of stuff from  
**[0:15:04-0:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:15:04):**  peas to every type of green that you can imagine.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:15:07):**  The arugula is coming up like you wouldn't believe.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:15:09):**  Alright, let's talk about what you can do in the kitchen.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:15:13):**  This is one that I have been doing since my early 20s and that's baking your own bread.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:15:17):**  And if you can make a sourdough starter, you don't even need to buy yeast.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:15:20):**  All you really need is flour and water.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:15:23):**  You can also get into fermentation for all of its benefits from nutrition to flavor and  
**[0:15:28-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:15:28):**  also the extension of storage.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:15:29):**  So if you can get like sauerkraut or kimchi or something like that going, any of those  
**[0:15:34-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:15:34):**  lactobacilic ferments are really really easy to do and you can store them outside of your  
**[0:15:40-0:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:15:40):**  fridge if you haven't got that much space in your fridge.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:15:44):**  You can also learn to forage for wild foods and medicine and urban and suburban areas  
**[0:15:48-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:15:48):**  have tons of options.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:15:49):**  Just look up what are the best in your area and make sure that you are able to identify  
**[0:15:54-0:15:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:15:54):**  them safely because you don't want to be eating or ingesting anything that you're not sure  
**[0:15:58-0:16:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:15:58):**  of what it is.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:16:00):**  You can also brew wine, beer, and liquor in your home.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:16:03):**  Careful because there might be some regulations on that, especially when it comes to liquor.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:16:07):**  You can dry herbs, fruits, veggies, and meats and there are a lot of small and compact food  
**[0:16:13-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:16:13):**  dehydrators that you can buy that will fit on your countertop in your kitchen.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:16:18):**  You can also can your harvest, whether it's from your own garden or from a big purchase  
**[0:16:23-0:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:16:23):**  from a local farmer, it's another great way to extend the shelf life of anything that  
**[0:16:28-0:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:16:28):**  you buy fresh so that you can eat it all season or later into other seasons later in the year.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:16:34):**  Now a lot of people don't think you can do much as far as like raising animals and the  
**[0:16:38-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:16:38):**  one option that I think could work really well, though I haven't done it myself yet,  
**[0:16:42-0:16:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:16:42):**  is raising rabbits and I've seen a lot of people have success with this in indoor hutches.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:16:47):**  Now obviously they can be pets but they can also produce great wool and manure which is  
**[0:16:51-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:16:51):**  great for your garden and if you're up for this type of thing, they're great meat as  
**[0:16:56-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:16:56):**  well.  
**[0:16:58-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:16:58):**  Now what about utilities?  
**[0:16:59-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:16:59):**  Well, you might not have control over your building per se because either you don't own  
**[0:17:04-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:17:04):**  it or it's collectively owned but you could try putting out a solar oven if you've got  
**[0:17:09-0:17:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:17:09):**  a sunny spot that gets enough hours of sun during the day.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:17:12):**  I've cooked in solar ovens many times and they work really great as long as you've got  
**[0:17:17-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:17:17):**  enough sun exposure.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:17:20):**  You can also look into pedal powered appliances like sewing machines, washing machines, and  
**[0:17:25-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:17:25):**  pottery wheels, all of which I have used pedal powered versions of, or even an alternator  
**[0:17:31-0:17:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:17:31):**  for power and you can buy kits where you can hook up an alternator to like a stationary  
**[0:17:36-0:17:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:17:36):**  bike and generate a little bit of power, at least enough to run a laptop or charge your  
**[0:17:40-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:17:40):**  phone.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:17:42):**  And you can also rely more on things like candle light and rechargeable batteries and  
**[0:17:46-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:17:46):**  other ways of kind of extending without having to use up too much power that perhaps you  
**[0:17:51-0:17:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:17:51):**  don't have much control over.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:17:53):**  Now when it comes to doing things in your household, this kind of stuff applies just  
**[0:17:56-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:17:56):**  as much to an apartment and a condo as it does to a house out in the country with 50  
**[0:18:02-0:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:18:02):**  acres.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:18:03):**  This is why I love all of the homesteading options is because everything revolving around  
**[0:18:07-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:18:07):**  the house is pretty much repeatable at any scale.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:18:11):**  You can do all kinds of things like make your own toiletries and personal care products.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:18:16):**  You can make a little repair or fix it shop for everything from electronics to clothing.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:18:22):**  You can make your own natural medicines and remedies.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:18:26):**  Your own furniture is pretty easy to make, especially if you're up for like salvaging  
**[0:18:32-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:18:32):**  materials.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:18:33):**  In fact, a lot of the years that I was traveling around and I was constantly relocating, I  
**[0:18:38-0:18:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:18:38):**  was not about to buy new furniture every time I got to a new place.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:18:41):**  You would be amazed at how many good pieces of furniture that either people throw out,  
**[0:18:46-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:18:46):**  especially if you want to contact a moving company.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:18:48):**  I've worked for moving companies before and you would not believe like the entire entertainment  
**[0:18:52-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:18:52):**  sets, couches, everything that you would need to furnish a home people are getting rid of  
**[0:18:56-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:18:56):**  all the time because it's more of a pain to move it than it is to just buy another one  
**[0:19:00-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:19:00):**  for them.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:19:02):**  You can make your own cleaning supplies and this can be scaled up all the way up to like  
**[0:19:07-0:19:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:19:07):**  a home-based business for making crafts or cooked meals or baked goods or anything that  
**[0:19:11-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:19:11):**  the regulations allow for where you live.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:19:14):**  So there are tons of options for small spaces even without garden, without land, and I really  
**[0:19:19-0:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:19:19):**  encourage you to look into them before telling me that you can't start homesteading until  
**[0:19:23-0:19:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:19:23):**  you move up to a bigger space.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:19:25):**  So now let's talk a little bit about taking steps towards self-sufficiency.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:19:30):**  Many people, including former clients of mine, have put out the lofty goal of being completely  
**[0:19:35-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:19:35):**  self-sufficient and it's worth examining what that really entails before you commit to it.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:19:41):**  Is that really what you want?  
**[0:19:43-0:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:19:43):**  I would highly recommend that you first design your ideal lifestyle and then determine the  
**[0:19:47-0:19:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:19:47):**  level of self-sufficiency that goes along with it.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:19:51):**  Complete self-sufficiency is surprisingly not resilient.  
**[0:19:55-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:19:55):**  Consider this anecdote from Natalie Bogwalker.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:19:57):**  She kind of told me a story from her time living primitively at the Wild Roots community  
**[0:20:02-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:20:02):**  in North Carolina and some of the realities and the things that people don't often think  
**[0:20:09-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:20:09):**  about when it comes to producing all of your own food and how much time it takes to process  
**[0:20:13-0:20:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:20:13):**  it.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:20:14):**  Most all of our vegetable needs were met by having a small garden and by foraging and  
**[0:20:24-0:20:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:20:24):**  by preserving the food that we forage from season to season so that we have access to  
**[0:20:30-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:20:30):**  it at different times.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:20:32):**  But we still dumpster dove some and we bought some food and so not all of our food needs  
**[0:20:39-0:20:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:20:39):**  were met off the land, but the vast majority were.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:20:43):**  And it was really, it took a lot of time.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:20:47):**  People I think often have this idea that primitive people lived in this idyllic way where they  
**[0:20:54-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:20:54):**  hardly worked or anything like that.  
**[0:20:56-0:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:20:56):**  It's just so bullshit.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:20:58):**  We had to, I hope that's okay to say that.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:21:01):**  No, of course.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:21:02):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:21:03):**  The reality.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:21:04):**  It took a lot of time.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:21:06):**  Like all of this foraging and all the food.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:21:09):**  I mean the food processing is huge amounts of time.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:21:14):**  And it's really fun and it's really fulfilling, but it's a huge amount of time.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:21:21):**  And yeah, so that's something that I think a lot of people don't account for is the amount  
**[0:21:27-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:21:27):**  of time that it takes just to wash all of these tubers that you have dug up or preserve  
**[0:21:34-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:21:34):**  a bunch of medicine and make tinctures and strain them, or pick all the leaves off of  
**[0:21:41-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:21:41):**  all of the nettles because the stems are actually a fiber crop and don't taste like you'd be  
**[0:21:47-0:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:21:47):**  chewing forever.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:21:48):**  So yeah, there's a lot of time that goes into that.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:21:54):**  And I was able to take that time at that time in my life.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:21:59):**  I didn't have any kids and I didn't have any debt, which was amazing.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:22:06):**  And I didn't have, like the land was actually purchased by kind of a philanthropist.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:22:13):**  So we paid for the land taxes, but we didn't have a mortgage.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:22:18):**  And so all of us were able to put the time that it took into all of that, which was such  
**[0:22:24-0:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:22:24):**  a blessing.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:22:26):**  And I really loved it, but I think it's definitely not for everyone.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:22:32):**  And I think that if you have debt, if you have kids, if you have financial responsibilities,  
**[0:22:39-0:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:22:39):**  it's really hard to do that.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:22:41):**  And it's especially a silly thing is I think I see a lot of people who take out big mortgages  
**[0:22:48-0:22:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:22:48):**  to buy some big piece of land and then they have to work all week and they don't get to  
**[0:22:54-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:22:54):**  be there and enjoy it.  
**[0:22:55-0:22:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:22:55):**  And that's just such a tragic, silly thing.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:22:59):**  I think that happens to more people.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:23:03):**  Pairing a certain level of self-reliance with a strategy of strengthening community connections  
**[0:23:07-0:23:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:23:07):**  to help provide your needs can do a lot to free up your time and resources.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:23:12):**  There are two ways that I would recommend that people develop resilience in their lives  
**[0:23:15-0:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:23:15):**  after advising and working with a lot of clients on projects like this.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:23:19):**  Breaking it down by categories and percentages and developing community-based self-sufficiency.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:23:26):**  So if you're determined to provide your own needs, start by breaking it down into categories.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:23:30):**  We all need food, water, shelter, and a livelihood.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:23:33):**  This could be an income.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:23:35):**  So this could be a really good place to start.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:23:38):**  Feel free to add other small categories that might be important to you like medicine or  
**[0:23:42-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:23:42):**  transportation.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:23:44):**  Which one of these categories do you feel is the most out of control or needs to be  
**[0:23:47-0:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:23:47):**  made more resilient?  
**[0:23:50-0:23:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:23:50):**  If you live in an arid region, this might be water.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:23:53):**  If you live out in the wilderness, this might be energy for heating and cooking fuel.  
**[0:23:57-0:23:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:23:57):**  It will totally depend on your situation.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:23:59):**  It's different for all of us.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:24:01):**  If all of them are outside of your control, you might want to pick one that you think  
**[0:24:04-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:24:04):**  you could most influence or would be most enjoyable to work on.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:24:09):**  From there, you can make a list of options available to you within your budget, space,  
**[0:24:13-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:24:13):**  and resources, and then decide which project to tackle first.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:24:17):**  A very important aspect that often gets overlooked when it comes to self-sufficient living is  
**[0:24:23-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:24:23):**  managing your consumption and looking for ways to save on the things that you need in  
**[0:24:28-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:24:28):**  your day-to-day life.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:24:29):**  I talked to John Moody, the author of The Frugal Homesteader, about what he thinks is  
**[0:24:34-0:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:24:34):**  an important mindset to cultivate when it comes to trying to save money in your home.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:24:39):**  Yeah, I think you have to view the world through a lens of creativity rather than consumerism.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:24:47):**  Most Americans, maybe not most Americans, but a lot of people, their general approach  
**[0:24:52-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:24:52):**  to a problem is a purchase.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:24:57):**  If I'm stressed out, I need to purchase a vacation or something or a locomoté, latte,  
**[0:25:04-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:25:04):**  mococap, whatever.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:25:07):**  Most people think they can buy their way to success.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:25:13):**  You really need to think your way to success.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:25:19):**  On occasion, that will involve buying stuff.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:25:23):**  My wife about six months ago, because we were having a hard time managing the inside portion  
**[0:25:31-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:25:31):**  of our homestead because we got five kids, and we have a couple of different businesses,  
**[0:25:37-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:25:37):**  and we homeschool, she's basically gotten rid of over half of our possessions over the  
**[0:25:47-0:25:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:25:47):**  past six months.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:25:50):**  We're talking like every category, even furniture.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:25:57):**  Less stuff has made us life so much easier and making us so much more successful.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:26:09):**  I also talked with Pam Dolling, the author of The Year-Round Hoop House, about another  
**[0:26:13-0:26:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:26:13):**  simple but very important tool for helping to produce your own food.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:26:17):**  She told me about how using a hoop house or greenhouse can make a big difference in extending  
**[0:26:23-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:26:23):**  the growing season.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:26:25):**  One year, this doesn't usually happen to us in Virginia, but one year we had a whole month  
**[0:26:30-0:26:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:26:30):**  when we had either snow on the ground or ice on the frozen soil, and we couldn't harvest  
**[0:26:36-0:26:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:26:36):**  outdoors.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:26:37):**  We kept 100 people in salads and cooking greens for a month in the middle of the winter from  
**[0:26:42-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:26:42):**  that one hoop house just fine.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:26:44):**  Wow, that is remarkable.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:26:46):**  Yeah, fairly remarkable.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:26:48):**  It was looking a bit worked over by the end, but it was very worth having.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:26:53):**  Yeah, for sure, that's your lifeline in those months, huh?  
**[0:26:56-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:26:56):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:26:58):**  And quite a few of those crops like kale and spinach and lettuce can all grow whenever  
**[0:27:04-0:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:27:04):**  it's above 40 Fahrenheit.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:27:07):**  And that happens a lot in the hoop house, whereas it doesn't happen so much of the time  
**[0:27:11-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:27:11):**  outdoors, even with road covers.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:27:14):**  When I spoke to one of my heroes in the homesteading world, Ben Fawk, he was actually in his own  
**[0:27:19-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:27:19):**  greenhouse weeding while we spoke together and took the time to tell me about some of  
**[0:27:23-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:27:23):**  the most important bang for your buck enterprises and projects that one can do on a homestead  
**[0:27:29-0:27:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:27:29):**  that really uses the time efficiently for the biggest gains and quality of life.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:27:33):**  Well, I'm in my greenhouse right now, a little hoop house, a new one that I built last year,  
**[0:27:38-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:27:38):**  and I'm weeding right now, which is pretty much what vegetable growing is most of the  
**[0:27:43-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:27:43):**  time.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:27:44):**  But I've got greens coming up.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:27:47):**  Vegetables, for sure.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:27:49):**  Sowing seeds, annual seeds, and growing vegetables, and it's funny to say that as the first part  
**[0:27:54-0:27:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:27:54):**  of my answer because we're so into perennial crops and I'm talking about the value of annuals.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:27:59):**  But vegetables are incredible, and you have a new start at it every single year to have  
**[0:28:07-0:28:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:28:07):**  a great vegetable garden.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:28:08):**  You can grow a ton of food quickly.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:28:11):**  That's low-hanging fruit, salad greens, garlic, potatoes, squash.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:28:18):**  Some of the basics for a lot of people are just super easy in our climate.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:28:22):**  No brainer.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:28:24):**  You can pretty much pay yourself $25 an hour to grow squash, I've found, with not much  
**[0:28:30-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:28:30):**  time for a lot of food once you get your system set up.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:28:34):**  Otherwise, certain trees, certain tree crops, certainly not all for us.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:28:40):**  Pears, apples, they take a while to bear, but there can be very low maintenance in our  
**[0:28:45-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:28:45):**  context and quite reliable, especially pears.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:28:50):**  Opposite of that might be cherries.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:28:51):**  We grow cherries, but they're not reliable for us, and they take more time.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:28:56):**  They're more disease-prone.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:29:01):**  Creating water storages in the landscape where they make sense is a very low-hanging fruit  
**[0:29:08-0:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:29:08):**  to have ponds, essentially.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:29:12):**  Swales in places, certainly not everywhere.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:29:14):**  Swales can be a very overdone strategy that everyone wants to do everywhere, or a lot  
**[0:29:20-0:29:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:29:20):**  of people want to do everywhere, but certainly they have many, many applicable places for  
**[0:29:25-0:29:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:29:25):**  us.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:29:26):**  They've been very low-hanging fruit, not a lot of earthwork to do a lot of value.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:29:31):**  Not in some places, but definitely early on and in a lot of places, they've been incredibly  
**[0:29:36-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:29:36):**  high return.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:29:38):**  Greenhouses, sensible greenhouses in our climate go a long way.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:29:44):**  Especially that climate, I was going to say.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:29:46):**  Yeah, they just go such a long way.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:29:49):**  Wood heat, I think wood heat where you're heating your water and space and can cook  
**[0:29:55-0:30:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:29:55):**  on it is incredibly high return and high resiliency and very maintainable and robust and resilient.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:30:08):**  Those are systems we stick with.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:30:10):**  There's a lot of others related to health, like just eating well and sauna and other  
**[0:30:18-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:30:18):**  systems and elements in the systems.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:30:23):**  I could name a whole lot, but those are a handful of good ones.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:30:31):**  Grazing certain animals can be if you have the time.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:30:33):**  If you have the space.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:30:35):**  Have the time and space, yeah.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:30:37):**  And again, it's so context dependent.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:30:41):**  It depends on what resources are available in abundance around you too.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:30:47):**  Now though all of these represent really good options for building a more resilient life,  
**[0:30:52-0:30:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:30:52):**  if none of these projects appeal to you or seem feasible with your lifestyle, there is  
**[0:30:56-0:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:30:56):**  a second option.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:30:58):**  Now the second option is developing community-based self-sufficiency.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:31:02):**  If you feel either that you're not able or motivated to work on becoming independent  
**[0:31:07-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:31:07):**  on any of the categories that I mentioned before, then perhaps you could try to source  
**[0:31:11-0:31:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:31:11):**  more of your needs from as close a source as possible.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:31:15):**  Rather than trying to become food independent, you could aim to source your food from a local  
**[0:31:19-0:31:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:31:19):**  farm or a co-op grocery store that buys from local producers.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:31:23):**  You might not be able to install your own wind or solar electric system, but you could  
**[0:31:27-0:31:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:31:27):**  buy your power from a company that does.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:31:30):**  Ideally one that is based as near to you as possible.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:31:34):**  So get creative and look to see if others in your area have found solutions for the  
**[0:31:37-0:31:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:31:37):**  problems you're working on.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:31:39):**  Another beautiful aspect to community reliance is that you can benefit your local economy  
**[0:31:43-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:31:43):**  in the process.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:31:45):**  Buying what you need from local producers and vendors means that your money stays near  
**[0:31:49-0:31:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:31:49):**  you and enriches the people around you.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:31:52):**  You can create stronger bonds and include others in your journey towards self-reliance  
**[0:31:55-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:31:55):**  too.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:31:57):**  As movements like these start to grow, they can even affect change in local government  
**[0:32:00-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:32:00):**  and regulations.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:32:02):**  Blowing urban backyard chickens in many US cities wasn't a top-down initiative, it  
**[0:32:07-0:32:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:32:07):**  came from people banding together and changing regulations in their communities.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:32:12):**  All throughout history we humans have succeeded through cooperation and collaboration.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:32:17):**  Before you think about what you can do on your own, think about how much more you could  
**[0:32:20-0:32:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:32:20):**  do if you collaborated.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:32:23):**  The irony of talking about self-sufficiency is that it's actually much more resilient  
**[0:32:27-0:32:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:32:27):**  when coupled with a strong community.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:32:29):**  While it can be difficult to influence real change as an individual at a state, national,  
**[0:32:33-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:32:33):**  or global scale, many of the steps required to make a positive impact in your community  
**[0:32:38-0:32:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:32:38):**  are simple and even fun.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:32:47):**  Now the homesteading community seems to be the largest and most established in the US,  
**[0:32:51-0:32:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:32:51):**  in part since that's where the homesteading concept originated.  
**[0:32:54-0:32:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:32:54):**  But I personally have more experience taking on homesteading ventures in countries outside  
**[0:32:59-0:33:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:32:59):**  of the US, and in fact I'm in the middle of a transition to a whole new one in northeastern  
**[0:33:03-0:33:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:33:03):**  Spain as I am recording this.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:33:06):**  Homesteading is tough enough when you're familiar with your surroundings and the invisible  
**[0:33:10-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:33:10):**  structures that govern life and society.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:33:13):**  But when you're trying to navigate a foreign system, it can be a lot tougher.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:33:17):**  Add in a foreign language and the learning curve gets much steeper.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:33:20):**  This applies just as much to people from outside the US who have moved there, because I know  
**[0:33:25-0:33:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:33:25):**  that many of the systems in place there are not at all welcoming or easy for newcomers.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:33:31):**  Now in my interview with Zach Barton, who is living on a permaculture farm in Nepal,  
**[0:33:35-0:33:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:33:35):**  he told me a lot about the climate, culture, and context that helps inform his design process  
**[0:33:40-0:33:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:33:40):**  and has helped him to integrate his life into a new and very foreign place from where he  
**[0:33:45-0:33:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:33:45):**  grew up.  
**[0:33:46-0:33:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:33:46):**  Okay, well I mean I think you probably, although you haven't been here, you probably understand  
**[0:33:53-0:34:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:33:53):**  a lot of the context because we're talking about indigenous people in the mountain and  
**[0:34:00-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:34:00):**  hillside so I think you have some great experience with that and I bet you we have a lot of similarities  
**[0:34:07-0:34:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:34:07):**  between our experiences for sure.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:34:10):**  I think there's a couple outstanding features of Nepal and the people and I think one of  
**[0:34:18-0:34:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:34:18):**  the main things is the diversity of ethnic groups that live here.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:34:23):**  So you have an extreme diversity of ethnic groups and different linguistic groups and  
**[0:34:33-0:34:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:34:33):**  then a really trippy fusion of Hinduism, Buddhism, and shamanism which is really alive and healthy.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:34:45):**  I mean it's mind-blowing.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:34:46):**  I think that's kind of one of the reasons why Nepal and Shambhala and all this stuff  
**[0:34:51-0:34:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:34:51):**  is famous is because you had this great mixing of cultures and peoples and ethnicities and  
**[0:34:57-0:35:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:34:57):**  you know all able to find a way to live together in synchronicity and peace and stuff like  
**[0:35:04-0:35:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:35:04):**  that.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:35:05):**  So the diversity of it all is really beautiful and refreshing and kind of one of the things  
**[0:35:11-0:35:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:35:11):**  I really love as well as the diversity of landscape and ecology because you have almost  
**[0:35:20-0:35:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:35:20):**  every single ecological region in the world except for let's say Mediterranean here from  
**[0:35:27-0:35:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:35:27):**  you know down to almost sea level all the way up to 8,800 meters you know you have a  
**[0:35:33-0:35:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:35:33):**  diversity of plants and environments and weather systems and soils and everything so I mean  
**[0:35:39-0:35:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:35:39):**  it's fantastically beautiful.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:35:42):**  It's the diversity is what makes it beautiful.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:35:48):**  The people in their culture reflect that right?  
**[0:35:50-0:35:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:35:50):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:35:51):**  The other really unique, sorry if I can say one more thing.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:35:57):**  The really unique thing I think to understand about Nepal specifically, this doesn't necessarily  
**[0:36:04-0:36:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:36:04):**  apply to India but about Nepal is Nepal was never colonized.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:36:08):**  Right?  
**[0:36:09-0:36:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:36:09):**  So you, I mean there was countries that tried, the Chinese tried, the Tibetans tried, the  
**[0:36:17-0:36:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:36:17):**  Indian and I mean the British tried when they after they took India they came from Nepal  
**[0:36:21-0:36:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:36:21):**  of course but they were never successful in occupying this country.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:36:28):**  So Nepal is really unique in the fact that it has been 100% responsible for guiding its  
**[0:36:37-0:36:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:36:37):**  own development.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:36:39):**  Okay and that means it's unique right?  
**[0:36:42-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:36:42):**  It's one of the only indigenous countries I mean one of the only indigenous groups which  
**[0:36:49-0:36:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:36:49):**  can say that and I mean I think that really speaks for how open and how loving and inclusive  
**[0:36:56-0:36:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:36:56):**  and stuff they are because they've never been taught to be the other.  
**[0:36:58-0:37:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:36:58):**  They've never thought of themselves as the other right?  
**[0:37:02-0:37:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:37:02):**  Yeah yeah.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:37:03):**  More subordinate to another culture occupying them.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:37:07):**  Yeah or they're less than another country or less than another culture.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:37:11):**  The need to be respectful of local culture and traditions, building community, adapting  
**[0:37:16-0:37:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:37:16):**  to a new way of life and even to a new view of the world is very important.  
**[0:37:21-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:37:21):**  If you are still considering moving to a new country to start your homesteading dreams  
**[0:37:25-0:37:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:37:25):**  there's a list of things that you might want to consider and plan for when homesteading  
**[0:37:28-0:37:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:37:28):**  in a foreign country.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:37:31):**  What are your main motivations to leave your home country?  
**[0:37:35-0:37:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:37:35):**  Make sure first that the issues aren't the same or worse in the country you're thinking  
**[0:37:39-0:37:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:37:39):**  of going to.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:37:41):**  What about the new country attracts you?  
**[0:37:44-0:37:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:37:44):**  Can you confirm that that's what life is really like or is it mostly romanticism and dreams  
**[0:37:49-0:37:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:37:49):**  from filtered Instagram pictures and the love of the local food because those are different  
**[0:37:53-0:37:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:37:53):**  things.  
**[0:37:55-0:38:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:37:55):**  Will the culture in the new place allow and support a homesteading lifestyle choice?  
**[0:38:01-0:38:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:38:01):**  Do local regulations and codes allow for the things that you want to do with your land?  
**[0:38:05-0:38:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:38:05):**  This is kind of related to the other one.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:38:07):**  If you're planning on doing some kind of major farming enterprise and though the land is  
**[0:38:11-0:38:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:38:11):**  sufficient, the local coding bodies and restrictions aren't going to let you do it, it might not  
**[0:38:17-0:38:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:38:17):**  be a good decision.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:38:18):**  You might always be butting heads.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:38:21):**  How will you make money and account for your expenses in the new place?  
**[0:38:24-0:38:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:38:24):**  This is really important to look into.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:38:26):**  If you're thinking of selling farm goods and homemade products, make sure that first you're  
**[0:38:31-0:38:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:38:31):**  allowed to and second that there's a market for those things before counting on it as  
**[0:38:35-0:38:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:38:35):**  a potential income.  
**[0:38:44-0:38:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:38:44):**  Now I get a lot of questions from people asking how they can start to earn an income on their  
**[0:38:49-0:38:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:38:49):**  homestead whatever that might look like.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:38:52):**  And this makes good sense because I did just get finished talking about how it's actually  
**[0:38:55-0:38:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:38:55):**  not very resilient to be entirely self-sufficient.  
**[0:38:58-0:39:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:38:58):**  And especially in the startup phase of a homestead, you're probably going to need to bring in  
**[0:39:03-0:39:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:39:03):**  a lot of things from offsite and not all of them are you going to be able to find for  
**[0:39:07-0:39:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:39:07):**  free or to salvage.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:39:08):**  And so you're going to need some kind of an income, especially if you've either taken  
**[0:39:12-0:39:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:39:12):**  on some debt or like a mortgage to buy the place that you've moved up to.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:39:17):**  You're going to need to keep that cash flowing.  
**[0:39:20-0:39:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:39:20):**  And luckily there's tons of options of ways to make money on a homestead and they're about  
**[0:39:25-0:39:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:39:25):**  as diverse as any other type of business enterprise.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:39:28):**  Now as we get into this, I do want to say that I am not a business expert and I don't  
**[0:39:34-0:39:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:39:34):**  intend to act like one here.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:39:36):**  I won't be giving business templates or specific advice for two main reasons.  
**[0:39:40-0:39:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:39:40):**  First there's way too many variables between business regulations, certification bodies  
**[0:39:45-0:39:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:39:45):**  and tax laws that your context might be completely different from mine.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:39:50):**  Second there are undoubtedly many reliable and experienced voices on successful business  
**[0:39:54-0:39:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:39:54):**  building that are specific to your place and all of those variables available to you online  
**[0:39:59-0:40:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:39:59):**  or in your community.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:40:01):**  So here I'll just be presenting ideas that I've either tried or I've seen work for other  
**[0:40:05-0:40:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:40:05):**  homesteaders across different contexts.  
**[0:40:08-0:40:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:40:08):**  I'll also give you a list of useful information to gather before investing time and money  
**[0:40:12-0:40:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:40:12):**  into your business to help you manage the risk as much as possible.  
**[0:40:16-0:40:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:40:16):**  Now I certainly believe that any ethical and legal business venture involves at least some  
**[0:40:21-0:40:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:40:21):**  risk and I've certainly failed plenty of times as an entrepreneur and I intend to fail a  
**[0:40:25-0:40:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:40:25):**  good deal more.  
**[0:40:27-0:40:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:40:27):**  Obviously not because I enjoy failure per se but because I also believe that if you've  
**[0:40:31-0:40:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:40:31):**  never failed it means you've never really challenged yourself sufficiently.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:40:35):**  The good news is that business planning is not really different for a homestead enterprise  
**[0:40:39-0:40:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:40:39):**  than it is for any other venture and you don't have to reinvent the wheel here.  
**[0:40:43-0:40:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:40:43):**  You just need to do a lot of research, organization and planning to make good decisions to manage  
**[0:40:48-0:40:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:40:48):**  risk and to have a reasonable chance at success.  
**[0:40:52-0:40:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:40:52):**  So some of the main essential information that I advise on gathering would first be  
**[0:40:58-0:41:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:40:58):**  to decide what sector your business is in.  
**[0:41:01-0:41:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:41:01):**  Small differences in your sector can come with completely different rules and regulations.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:41:06):**  For example raw or cooked food, wholesale or direct to consumer.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:41:11):**  Those are both examples of similar sectors that often get regulated very differently  
**[0:41:16-0:41:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:41:16):**  in many places.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:41:19):**  From there looking into local regulations.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:41:21):**  So after defining that sector you'll know which rules and regulations are going to apply  
**[0:41:26-0:41:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:41:26):**  to you much better and you'll want to get more informed on what rules and regulations  
**[0:41:32-0:41:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:41:32):**  govern how you can do business where you're located.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:41:35):**  In my case the business regulations are extremely different here in Spain than they were in  
**[0:41:40-0:41:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:41:40):**  Guatemala as they were from the Philippines or any of the other places that I've lived.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:41:44):**  And so it's really worth taking the time to get to know what the constraints are where  
**[0:41:49-0:41:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:41:49):**  you live.  
**[0:41:51-0:41:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:41:51):**  From there you want to do sufficient market research.  
**[0:41:53-0:41:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:41:53):**  Now until you know who you're selling to, what they're willing to pay for a product  
**[0:41:58-0:42:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:41:58):**  or service and their preferred way of buying something, you're going to struggle to develop  
**[0:42:02-0:42:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:42:02):**  a strategy of how to reach them.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:42:06):**  Now once you have all this information then you can start getting a better idea of your  
**[0:42:10-0:42:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:42:10):**  financial situation.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:42:12):**  If you don't have experience analyzing things like operational costs, startup costs, gross  
**[0:42:18-0:42:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:42:18):**  and net profit or financial projections, I would highly recommend either taking a good  
**[0:42:24-0:42:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:42:24):**  course or getting professional help.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:42:27):**  This is really key to determining whether you have a sound business idea or just a creative  
**[0:42:33-0:42:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:42:33):**  and laborious way to lose all of your savings because that's very quickly what a business  
**[0:42:38-0:42:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:42:38):**  can turn into if you don't have a good plan.  
**[0:42:42-0:42:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:42:42):**  So yes, this is a short list and I know that there is a lot more that goes into making  
**[0:42:46-0:42:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:42:46):**  a complete business plan, but if you get at least all of these categories sorted and well  
**[0:42:51-0:42:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:42:51):**  researched you'll be a lot better off than many people who start micro businesses and  
**[0:42:56-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:42:56):**  you'll be better informed as to what other information and steps you'll need to take  
**[0:43:01-0:43:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:43:01):**  to be well prepared.  
**[0:43:03-0:43:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:43:03):**  Perhaps the single best thing that you can do to get a clear picture of what running  
**[0:43:06-0:43:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:43:06):**  your business will look like is to find somebody who is succeeding in a similar venture with  
**[0:43:11-0:43:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:43:11):**  a similar context to yours and ask them directly.  
**[0:43:14-0:43:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:43:14):**  You can shortcut so much of the guesswork by going straight to an experienced source.  
**[0:43:20-0:43:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:43:20):**  Now if you're not yet thinking about monetizing the things that you produce on your homestead,  
**[0:43:25-0:43:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:43:25):**  I'll give you this example when I spoke to Deborah earlier in the series about how their  
**[0:43:30-0:43:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:43:30):**  ambitions to start producing all of their own needs quickly expanded into realizing  
**[0:43:36-0:43:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:43:36):**  that they were producing a huge surplus and it became one of the reasons why they started  
**[0:43:41-0:43:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:43:41):**  to sell a lot of the products that they offer on their homestead.  
**[0:43:45-0:43:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:43:45):**  Well we have 32 acres, but honestly we could do what we wanted to do on 10 acres.  
**[0:43:52-0:43:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:43:52):**  We overbought because we thought we needed this much.  
**[0:43:58-0:44:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:43:58):**  Our property has a creek that runs through it which essentially made two-thirds of it  
**[0:44:03-0:44:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:44:03):**  very difficult to use.  
**[0:44:06-0:44:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:44:06):**  And so we learned fairly quickly like, oh yeah, we really don't need all those other  
**[0:44:11-0:44:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:44:11):**  acres.  
**[0:44:15-0:44:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:44:15):**  And it sounds challenging because our original goal was just to grow things for ourselves,  
**[0:44:21-0:44:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:44:21):**  but the reason we wound up selling things is because we wound up producing more than  
**[0:44:27-0:44:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:44:27):**  we needed.  
**[0:44:28-0:44:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:44:28):**  Like if you have a pig, she's going to have, depending on what breed, she's going to have  
**[0:44:31-0:44:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:44:31):**  somewhere between five and 10 babies and most families are not going to eat that much pork  
**[0:44:38-0:44:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:44:38):**  in a year.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:44:41):**  So you wind up like, oh, okay, I need to find some people who want to buy pork from us.  
**[0:44:47-0:44:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:44:47):**  And with the sheep, we realized also that, well, if we're going to breed them, we really  
**[0:44:56-0:44:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:44:56):**  don't need that many sheep.  
**[0:44:58-0:45:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:44:58):**  We started with two pregnant ewes and within only three or four years, we had 20 sheep  
**[0:45:07-0:45:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:45:07):**  because we wanted our own wool, which is really fun.  
**[0:45:10-0:45:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:45:10):**  It's a whole other level.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:45:12):**  But yeah, we're like, oh my gosh, we have 20 sheep.  
**[0:45:15-0:45:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:45:15):**  We don't need this much wool.  
**[0:45:18-0:45:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:45:18):**  So we need to start selling it.  
**[0:45:19-0:45:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:45:19):**  So that's kind of it.  
**[0:45:22-0:45:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:45:22):**  The whole thing honestly was a lot easier than we were expecting it to be.  
**[0:45:28-0:45:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:45:28):**  And so that was how we wound up selling stuff was because we wound up with so much more  
**[0:45:34-0:45:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:45:34):**  than what we needed.  
**[0:45:43-0:45:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:45:43):**  So about two weeks ago, I sent out an email asking listeners to tell me what topics about  
**[0:45:48-0:45:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:45:48):**  self-sufficient living they were most interested in and wanted to know more about.  
**[0:45:52-0:45:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:45:52):**  And so I'm going to take the opportunity here to answer just a few of those responses that  
**[0:45:56-0:46:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:45:56):**  I think are a good reflection of some of the most common responses that I received.  
**[0:46:00-0:46:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:46:00):**  So the first one is from Helena Callow from the UK who asked, what do you do if you don't  
**[0:46:06-0:46:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:46:06):**  have a garden?  
**[0:46:07-0:46:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:46:07):**  Could you do a general chat about how the indoor life has affected people?  
**[0:46:12-0:46:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:46:12):**  How can you still feel connected to nature?  
**[0:46:15-0:46:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:46:15):**  And I think this is great because I know a lot of people are in lockdown, myself included  
**[0:46:19-0:46:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:46:19):**  right now, especially here in Europe, though it looks different and the regulations are  
**[0:46:23-0:46:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:46:23):**  different around the world.  
**[0:46:25-0:46:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:46:25):**  If you're staying put, sort of sheltering in place or in your house, it's going to start  
**[0:46:30-0:46:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:46:30):**  to take a toll pretty fast.  
**[0:46:32-0:46:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:46:32):**  And now personally, to kind of maintain my interactions with nature and to get fresh  
**[0:46:38-0:46:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:46:38):**  food especially, I've been doing a lot of sprouts and microgreens in the house and caring  
**[0:46:44-0:46:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:46:44):**  for plants and animals in the home.  
**[0:46:46-0:46:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:46:46):**  And if you have access to that at all, I highly recommend it.  
**[0:46:50-0:46:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:46:50):**  I've also been sprouting a lot of plants in order to transplant into a garden when I get  
**[0:46:54-0:46:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:46:54):**  more time or when the season's correct.  
**[0:46:57-0:47:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:46:57):**  And I'm fortunate that I've been able to get out to a neighbor's garden near me here a  
**[0:47:01-0:47:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:47:01):**  couple of times a week to take care of it.  
**[0:47:04-0:47:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:47:04):**  But there's also like you've got to take these moments, the little moments in my case, like  
**[0:47:11-0:47:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:47:11):**  the apartment that I'm in doesn't get a whole lot of sun, but a couple of hours a day the  
**[0:47:14-0:47:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:47:14):**  sun comes streaming through the windows or out on the terrace and I always make time  
**[0:47:18-0:47:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:47:18):**  to go and sit out there for as long as I can and get all the sun that I'm able to, seeing  
**[0:47:24-0:47:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:47:24):**  as it's kind of a short window to do so.  
**[0:47:27-0:47:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:47:27):**  I mean, I really believe that staying home is an act of solidarity for the health of  
**[0:47:31-0:47:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:47:31):**  your community and you should take it really seriously.  
**[0:47:34-0:47:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:47:34):**  But you should also take time to find any opportunity that you can to get some extra  
**[0:47:38-0:47:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:47:38):**  sun and to interact with nature as you can.  
**[0:47:42-0:47:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:47:42):**  The next question comes from Dave in the UK who writes, I'm fortunate to have sufficient  
**[0:47:46-0:47:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:47:46):**  space in my two acre plot to experiment with some permy concepts and food medicinal plant  
**[0:47:52-0:47:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:47:52):**  growing, but the transition to a genuinely regenerative lifestyle is some time away yet.  
**[0:47:58-0:48:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:47:58):**  So all kinds of content that relate to practical things that can be done by people who perhaps  
**[0:48:03-0:48:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:48:03):**  have some space like an allotment or vegetable garden, etc, but are still tied to a corporate  
**[0:48:08-0:48:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:48:08):**  type job would be interesting.  
**[0:48:10-0:48:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:48:10):**  Yeah, this is again a very common one that I hear.  
**[0:48:14-0:48:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:48:14):**  Thank you, Dave.  
**[0:48:16-0:48:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:48:16):**  Breaking away from kind of these ties, these things that still hold you back and into a  
**[0:48:21-0:48:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:48:21):**  society that you'd prefer to move away from are, I mean, I think everybody's working towards  
**[0:48:27-0:48:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:48:27):**  that.  
**[0:48:28-0:48:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:48:28):**  I'm still on a journey towards it, but a lot of the content that I put out in this episode  
**[0:48:32-0:48:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:48:32):**  and in the e-book on ways to build small enterprises and build upon them for homestead related  
**[0:48:39-0:48:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:48:39):**  activities.  
**[0:48:40-0:48:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:48:40):**  So if you have a piece of land that's large enough to create some kind of produce, whether  
**[0:48:45-0:48:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:48:45):**  that's, you know, vegetables and crops or animal products or herbs and medicines, there's  
**[0:48:52-0:48:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:48:52):**  so many different things that you can make.  
**[0:48:54-0:49:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:48:54):**  And the key to that is that, like, unless you're a larger operation, creating things  
**[0:49:00-0:49:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:49:00):**  at wholesale levels, it's going to be hard to make a living just on raw products.  
**[0:49:06-0:49:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:49:06):**  And so you don't actually have to make that much if you can find a good way of turning  
**[0:49:12-0:49:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:49:12):**  it into sort of a value added commodity.  
**[0:49:15-0:49:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:49:15):**  And this is going to look different, completely dependent on what it is you're able to produce.  
**[0:49:20-0:49:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:49:20):**  But by adding value to that product, you're going to be able to get a higher price from  
**[0:49:25-0:49:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:49:25):**  it.  
**[0:49:26-0:49:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:49:26):**  And then there's also a lot of other things that you can do to expand on an enterprise,  
**[0:49:29-0:49:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:49:29):**  no matter how small it is.  
**[0:49:30-0:49:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:49:30):**  So if you're good at adding value to, let's say, a veggie box, you can turn it into like  
**[0:49:36-0:49:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:49:36):**  a gift basket or you could offer a service on top of that of either delivering it or  
**[0:49:42-0:49:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:49:42):**  teaching people how to grow their own or putting out, you know, webinars or online courses.  
**[0:49:49-0:49:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:49:49):**  There's so many different ways of sort of adding income to something that you're already  
**[0:49:53-0:49:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:49:53):**  doing.  
**[0:49:54-0:49:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:49:54):**  So think about what resources you have access to, any expertise, any particular services  
**[0:49:59-0:50:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:49:59):**  that you can do really well and see how many of those things you can kind of center around  
**[0:50:04-0:50:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:50:04):**  your home or your homestead and sort of use it as a transition to get away from whatever  
**[0:50:10-0:50:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:50:10):**  income or corporate job you might be tied to.  
**[0:50:15-0:50:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:50:15):**  And you know, it's a process.  
**[0:50:17-0:50:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:50:17):**  I'm still in it myself.  
**[0:50:18-0:50:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:50:18):**  I'm not entirely removed from it.  
**[0:50:20-0:50:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:50:20):**  And in this process, it's going to take time.  
**[0:50:25-0:50:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:50:25):**  So I wouldn't say, you know, quit your day job and just throw yourself into this, especially  
**[0:50:29-0:50:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:50:29):**  in the case that like the economy is not great at all right now.  
**[0:50:34-0:50:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:50:34):**  And that income might be pretty important for your personal savings, but you can take  
**[0:50:39-0:50:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:50:39):**  small steps towards greater independence in your income by sort of assessing what it is  
**[0:50:44-0:50:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:50:44):**  that you have to work with right now.  
**[0:50:47-0:50:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:50:47):**  So the next series of questions comes from Sarah Fard, and I've been in touch a couple  
**[0:50:51-0:50:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:50:51):**  of times with Sarah in the past, and she's been a really good source of links and new  
**[0:50:56-0:50:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:50:56):**  learning for me.  
**[0:50:57-0:50:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:50:57):**  So I thank you, Sarah.  
**[0:50:58-0:51:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:50:58):**  And though I don't have time to get to all the questions you asked, which are pretty  
**[0:51:01-0:51:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:51:01):**  numerous, I do want to focus on one that I think is very relevant for right now, which  
**[0:51:05-0:51:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:51:05):**  is how do we navigate through the heap pile of info and noise and get focused?  
**[0:51:13-0:51:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:51:13):**  And I would imagine you're referring to kind of all of the different information and conflicting  
**[0:51:17-0:51:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:51:17):**  viewpoints and different assessments that are coming from this pandemic and both on  
**[0:51:22-0:51:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:51:22):**  the political sides and the economic sides mostly.  
**[0:51:26-0:51:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:51:26):**  But in my case, like I've definitely been feeling this too, sort of an overwhelm of  
**[0:51:30-0:51:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:51:30):**  information and not knowing which source to trust or, you know, with so much of it being  
**[0:51:35-0:51:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:51:35):**  extremely negative right now, it can really affect your day to day mood and your mental  
**[0:51:39-0:51:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:51:39):**  well-being.  
**[0:51:40-0:51:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:51:40):**  And so I have, for the most part, decided to turn it off.  
**[0:51:44-0:51:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:51:44):**  There's a couple of sources that I personally trust, but they might not be the same for  
**[0:51:48-0:51:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:51:48):**  you.  
**[0:51:50-0:51:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:51:50):**  So I'm not going to make any direct recommendations.  
**[0:51:52-0:51:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:51:52):**  But one of the things that I did do early in this process when it started to feel overwhelming,  
**[0:51:56-0:52:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:51:56):**  kind of what was going on outside is, yeah, really just turning a lot of it off and taking  
**[0:52:01-0:52:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:52:01):**  the time to look inward and figure out like where are your fears and anxieties coming  
**[0:52:06-0:52:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:52:06):**  from, where are sort of the insecurities stemming from.  
**[0:52:11-0:52:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:52:11):**  And if you can identify those, you can probably identify the information that would be useful  
**[0:52:15-0:52:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:52:15):**  in this time.  
**[0:52:16-0:52:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:52:16):**  So if you're feeling insecure about, you know, either where your paycheck's coming from or  
**[0:52:21-0:52:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:52:21):**  where your food is going to come from in the future, maybe just focus on those topics for  
**[0:52:26-0:52:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:52:26):**  a while.  
**[0:52:27-0:52:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:52:27):**  And rather than listening to all of the different statistics about, you know, how many contagions  
**[0:52:31-0:52:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:52:31):**  and how many deaths are coming from around the world due to the COVID crisis, you could  
**[0:52:35-0:52:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:52:35):**  look into, OK, how can I take steps to be more resilient for producing my own food,  
**[0:52:40-0:52:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:52:40):**  which is a really common one right now, or what are some ways that I can start to produce  
**[0:52:45-0:52:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:52:45):**  an income.  
**[0:52:46-0:52:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:52:46):**  But honestly, all of that, in my opinion, is somewhat self-serving.  
**[0:52:50-0:52:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:52:50):**  And what we need more right now, especially if you're in a relatively comfortable position,  
**[0:52:54-0:52:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:52:54):**  obviously, if you're in a state of emergency, you need to take care of yourself first.  
**[0:52:58-0:53:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:52:58):**  But if you're mostly just kind of bored or feeling cooped up in your house and wondering  
**[0:53:02-0:53:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:53:02):**  what to do, I know for myself, I have felt a lot better looking into options about what  
**[0:53:07-0:53:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:53:07):**  I can do for others in my community around me and what are some ways that either I can  
**[0:53:13-0:53:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:53:13):**  start to learn some skills or prepare myself to be of service to this community that's  
**[0:53:17-0:53:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:53:17):**  going to be needing to recover and a lot of people who are going to be in much less fortunate  
**[0:53:21-0:53:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:53:21):**  positions coming out of this than I am.  
**[0:53:24-0:53:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:53:24):**  And you know, that's going to look different for everybody.  
**[0:53:27-0:53:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:53:27):**  And your capacities to help, your skills, your resources are going to all be different.  
**[0:53:33-0:53:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:53:33):**  But I'm sure if you think about it and are creative about it, you can find some really  
**[0:53:37-0:53:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:53:37):**  good options that are specific to your strengths.  
**[0:53:41-0:53:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:53:41):**  And don't put you in a state of vulnerability or put undue risk on yourself or your family  
**[0:53:46-0:53:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:53:46):**  in the process.  
**[0:53:47-0:53:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:53:47):**  So taking a look at how you can be of service to your community is something that I have  
**[0:53:51-0:53:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:53:51):**  really found has improved my mental well-being and my thought patterns in this time.  
**[0:53:57-0:54:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:53:57):**  And I hope some of this idea or advice is helpful to you out there as well.  
**[0:54:03-0:54:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:54:03):**  So the last question that I'm going to address today comes from Thomas Bakker from the Netherlands.  
**[0:54:08-0:54:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:54:08):**  And this is a very loaded question, but I'm just going to try and get to the core of it.  
**[0:54:13-0:54:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:54:13):**  He asks, I would like to learn more about preventing harmful insects, weeds, fungi,  
**[0:54:18-0:54:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:54:18):**  and bacteria.  
**[0:54:19-0:54:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:54:19):**  And I'm also interested in large scale potato production with a permaculture approach.  
**[0:54:24-0:54:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:54:24):**  A lot of times I struggle to see how we can feed the world population without using pesticides  
**[0:54:29-0:54:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:54:29):**  and fertilizer.  
**[0:54:30-0:54:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:54:30):**  Well, maybe that's not a question, but I think I know what he's getting at.  
**[0:54:33-0:54:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:54:33):**  And I'm not going to speak specifically to weeds, fungi, bacteria, or large scale potato  
**[0:54:39-0:54:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:54:39):**  production because I don't have all of the information to make an educated recommendation  
**[0:54:45-0:54:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:54:45):**  on this, though I know a little bit about the agricultural situation in the Netherlands.  
**[0:54:51-0:54:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:54:51):**  Let's get to struggling to see how we can feed the world population without using pesticides  
**[0:54:57-0:54:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:54:57):**  and fertilizers.  
**[0:54:58-0:55:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:54:58):**  Well, first of all, that statement kind of presumes that we're doing a good job of it  
**[0:55:03-0:55:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:55:03):**  already.  
**[0:55:06-0:55:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:55:06):**  The truth is that most agriculture is actually not industrial agriculture or using chemical  
**[0:55:11-0:55:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:55:11):**  fertilizers.  
**[0:55:12-0:55:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:55:12):**  In fact, it's only really only makes up about 30 percent of large scale industrial agriculture  
**[0:55:20-0:55:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:55:20):**  that uses a lot of these chemicals.  
**[0:55:23-0:55:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:55:23):**  Still a vast majority of the agricultural around the world that feeds most people is  
**[0:55:28-0:55:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:55:28):**  small scale agriculture that doesn't rely nearly as much on pesticides and fertilizers.  
**[0:55:33-0:55:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:55:33):**  And I mean, even those things are a very recent phenomenon.  
**[0:55:39-0:55:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:55:39):**  Two things are likely to happen.  
**[0:55:40-0:55:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:55:40):**  I think either we're going to destroy the ecological base and the topsoil and everything  
**[0:55:47-0:55:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:55:47):**  else that comes with that, which is absolutely essential to producing the crops that feed  
**[0:55:50-0:55:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:55:50):**  the world as it is, which is going to result in a devastating and drastic decline in world  
**[0:55:57-0:56:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:55:57):**  population, or it's simply not going to be able to keep up with population growth.  
**[0:56:03-0:56:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:56:03):**  And that is also either going to halt it or cause it to decrease dramatically.  
**[0:56:07-0:56:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:56:07):**  And I think unless we can start to transition the portion of agriculture that is reliant  
**[0:56:13-0:56:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:56:13):**  on fertilizers and pesticides to a model that does more to reestablish the essential services  
**[0:56:21-0:56:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:56:21):**  of our ecosystems and the health that is needed to actually grow things.  
**[0:56:26-0:56:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:56:26):**  The fact is that we're working from a very, very degraded landscape as it is.  
**[0:56:32-0:56:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:56:32):**  So much of what it is that we rely on for our diets and to supply the world population  
**[0:56:38-0:56:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:56:38):**  is already coming from a deficit.  
**[0:56:41-0:56:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:56:41):**  And our agricultural practices, even the small scale ones, are still kind of extracting nutrients  
**[0:56:48-0:56:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:56:48):**  and health from the ground without putting it back.  
**[0:56:51-0:56:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:56:51):**  And if we can transition as soon as possible, ideally before now already, to a model that  
**[0:56:58-0:57:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:56:58):**  puts back the health and the nutrition and the connections and, you know, sort of honors  
**[0:57:04-0:57:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:57:04):**  the right for all life to thrive on this planet, we're not even going to scratch the surface  
**[0:57:10-0:57:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:57:10):**  of the potential of how much we can produce because it's just taking away from a base  
**[0:57:15-0:57:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:57:15):**  that's going to continually degrade.  
**[0:57:17-0:57:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:57:17):**  So I'm actually going to be transitioning into a whole other series on regenerative  
**[0:57:23-0:57:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:57:23):**  agriculture starting next Friday.  
**[0:57:26-0:57:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:57:26):**  And I'll be talking with a lot of experts, starting with Joel Salatin, exactly all about  
**[0:57:31-0:57:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:57:31):**  these topics.  
**[0:57:32-0:57:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:57:32):**  So rather than taking it from me, I've not worked in large scale agriculture since I  
**[0:57:36-0:57:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:57:36):**  was about 19.  
**[0:57:39-0:57:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:57:39):**  I'm going to leave it to the experts and refer you to that series which starts next Friday.  
**[0:57:45-0:57:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:57:45):**  So with all of that said, I'm going to leave that topic on this note, which is an excerpt  
**[0:57:49-0:57:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:57:49):**  from the interview that I did earlier in this series with Ayana Young, where we talk about  
**[0:57:54-0:57:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:57:54):**  some of the relationship between humans and our ecosystems and how we should better interact  
**[0:57:59-0:58:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:57:59):**  with them.  
**[0:58:00-0:58:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:58:00):**  We can't keep asking the earth to conform to every one of our desires or wants or even  
**[0:58:10-0:58:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:58:10):**  needs.  
**[0:58:11-0:58:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:58:11):**  The earth is not here to serve us all the time.  
**[0:58:16-0:58:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:58:16):**  We take advantage of the earth so much and just expect the earth to do everything we  
**[0:58:20-0:58:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:58:20):**  want rather than trying to ask how can we serve the earth?  
**[0:58:25-0:58:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:58:25):**  How can we show up for these living systems and fulfill their needs and desires rather  
**[0:58:35-0:58:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:58:35):**  than vice versa?  
**[0:58:36-0:58:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:58:36):**  Because if we fulfill the earth's needs, we are going to be fed, we're going to be met,  
**[0:58:40-0:58:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:58:40):**  we're going to be most of the time taken care of if we can actually listen to what the earth  
**[0:58:47-0:58:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:58:47):**  is needing in order to be abundant.  
**[0:58:50-0:58:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:58:50):**  But we don't do that anymore.  
**[0:58:52-0:59:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:58:52):**  And so it's just very, we've gotten into a very selfish cycle with our human desires.  
**[0:59:00-0:59:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:59:00):**  And in a way I understand it, we're animals and we want to survive.  
**[0:59:05-0:59:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:59:05):**  And it makes sense that we think about ourselves and our needs and our wants.  
**[0:59:12-0:59:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:59:12):**  But I do think that as intelligent beings, we need to really consider what we're asking  
**[0:59:21-0:59:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:59:21):**  of the earth and how that is going to not only affect the earth, but eventually affect  
**[0:59:28-0:59:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:59:28):**  us, which is definitely what we're seeing now.  
**[0:59:38-0:59:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:59:38):**  All right, as we wrap up now, hopefully this special episode and all the interviews leading  
**[0:59:42-0:59:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:59:42):**  up to it have given you a pretty complete and detailed look into modern homesteading  
**[0:59:47-0:59:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:59:47):**  and the huge variety of possibilities that the movement represents.  
**[0:59:51-0:59:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:59:51):**  If there's anything important that I forgot to mention or you feel that I misrepresented,  
**[0:59:55-0:59:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:59:55):**  feel free to let me know in the comments.  
**[0:59:56-1:00:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=0:59:56):**  I learned so much from the feedback that I get from you listeners, so don't be shy.  
**[1:00:01-1:00:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=1:00:01):**  As I said before, homesteading has always been more of a mindset to me.  
**[1:00:04-1:00:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=1:00:04):**  And one of the things that gives me hope during this time of global pandemic and all the fear  
**[1:00:08-1:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=1:00:08):**  and anxiety that comes with it is that I've been seeing so much creativity and resilience  
**[1:00:13-1:00:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=1:00:13):**  coming from people from every walk of life.  
**[1:00:16-1:00:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=1:00:16):**  There's a huge surge in interest in topics like this and how to provide for oneself and  
**[1:00:20-1:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=1:00:20):**  community as we kind of collectively wake up to the knowledge that we never had to give  
**[1:00:25-1:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=1:00:25):**  up these skills and this ability in the first place.  
**[1:00:29-1:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=1:00:29):**  I'm really touched by the abundance of small acts between neighbors to support one another  
**[1:00:33-1:00:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=1:00:33):**  and the heroic efforts to support those who are most vulnerable at this time.  
**[1:00:38-1:00:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=1:00:38):**  I applaud all of you who have stepped up to help in whatever ways that you found, and  
**[1:00:41-1:00:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=1:00:41):**  I encourage you to continue, even as this epidemic draws out, to continue to do whatever  
**[1:00:47-1:00:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/a-guide-to-resilient-living-wherever-you-are/#t=1:00:47):**  you can to support the people around you.

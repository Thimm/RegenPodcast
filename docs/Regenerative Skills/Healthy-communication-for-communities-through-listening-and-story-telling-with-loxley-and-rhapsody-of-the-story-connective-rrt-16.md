**[0:02:11-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:02:11):**  I'm super excited to share today's interview with all of you, not only because I had such  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:02:15):**  a good time speaking with Loxley and Rhapsody from The Story Connective, but because they  
**[0:02:20-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:02:20):**  impart such incredible insights into storytelling, connecting to community, and a topic which  
**[0:02:25-0:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:02:25):**  I'm increasingly interested in, which is listening.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:02:28):**  Not only listening as a passive way of absorbing information, but active listening, by asking  
**[0:02:32-0:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:02:32):**  good questions and demonstrating that you've heard and understood the other person.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:02:37):**  Some of you might ask, how does this fit into regenerative living in permaculture?  
**[0:02:41-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:02:41):**  To which I would say, listening and communication are essential to the design process of everything  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:02:46):**  from ecosystem regeneration to social permaculture in communities and observing systems at a  
**[0:02:51-0:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:02:51):**  deeper level.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:02:52):**  So throughout this season in general, I'm going to be getting back to basics and strengthening  
**[0:02:56-0:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:02:56):**  the fundamentals of good design, and I think all of you out there would agree with me when  
**[0:02:59-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:02:59):**  I say that honing the skills of observation, listening, and then communicating what you've  
**[0:03:03-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:03:03):**  learned through storytelling are essential to understanding the context and nuances of  
**[0:03:08-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:03:08):**  any design project.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:03:10):**  Especially as we wrap up this month's focus on regenerative community and its many forms,  
**[0:03:13-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:03:13):**  the most common challenge I've heard and even experienced myself that gets in the way of  
**[0:03:17-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:03:17):**  healthy community dynamics is communication and conflict resolution.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:03:22):**  Now I first met Loxley and Rhapsody at a New Year's party at our friend's place across  
**[0:03:26-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:03:26):**  the valley from us.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:03:27):**  They were traveling on their honeymoon and visiting our mutual friend Manola, and we  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:03:30):**  hit it off immediately when I learned that they also produce podcasts and are passionate  
**[0:03:34-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:03:34):**  about social permaculture.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:03:36):**  The two of them are based on the island of Maui in Hawaii and publish stories that strengthen  
**[0:03:41-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:03:41):**  community wherever they go.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:03:43):**  So during this conversation, we talk about their journey, how to tell better stories,  
**[0:03:47-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:03:47):**  the power that those narratives can have in connecting people and much, much more.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:03:52):**  So before I give it all away, here's Loxley and Rhapsody from the Story Connective.  
**[0:03:57-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:03:57):**  Welcome guys.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:03:58):**  I'll have you introduce yourselves in just a second, but thank you so much for not only  
**[0:04:02-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:04:02):**  agreeing to be on the podcast, but spending some time here on our farm.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:04:06):**  It's always a pleasure to get to talk to people in person.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:04:09):**  Seen as so many of the interviews that I do are over Skype and I don't get to see people's  
**[0:04:12-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:04:12):**  faces.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:04:13):**  This is a real treat.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:04:14):**  The two of you represent the Story Connective, which is an amazing podcast.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:04:20):**  And before I go too much into that, how about each of you introduce yourselves and we'll  
**[0:04:24-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:04:24):**  go from there.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:04:25):**  Yep.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:04:26):**  My name is Loxley and I am the co-founder of story connective.org.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:04:32):**  And my name is Rebecca Rhapsody.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:04:34):**  It's so great to be here on the farm.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:04:35):**  We're thrilled to be in Guatemala.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:04:36):**  We're usually in Maui, Hawaii.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:04:39):**  So let's start off by talking a little bit about your, each of your backgrounds individually,  
**[0:04:45-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:04:45):**  how you came to focus on regenerative lifestyle skillsets and eventually culminated into a  
**[0:04:52-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:04:52):**  podcast centered around storytelling.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:04:57):**  So for myself, I love nonfiction.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:05:00):**  Absolutely love nonfiction, love history and politics.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:05:04):**  I love anthropology and for about 10 years of my early adult life, I got obsessed, completely  
**[0:05:13-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:05:13):**  obsessed with documentaries.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:05:15):**  I was just, I found out that you could watch them online and I was watching documentaries  
**[0:05:20-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:05:20):**  about all sorts of things.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:05:21):**  I mean, yes, anthropology and history, but also about arts and the history of cinema  
**[0:05:26-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:05:26):**  and so much.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:05:29):**  And for a lot of it, I realized that the great majority of the documentary film world, I  
**[0:05:37-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:05:37):**  would hazard a guess of 95% or more talks about the problems of the world.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:05:44):**  It's very, very negative.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:05:45):**  And after about 10 years of that, I just was in total despair about the world around me.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:05:51):**  And then I myself discovered, I stumbled upon this documentary called Engraved Danger of  
**[0:05:58-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:05:58):**  Falling Food, which you can watch on YouTube.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:06:01):**  It's about 50 minutes long and it's a biography of Bill Mollison, the co-founder of the concept  
**[0:06:07-0:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:06:07):**  of permaculture.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:06:09):**  And it slipped me into this abundance-based, solutions-based paradigm.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:06:18):**  And ever since then, I mean, I just, I went the other direction and I started studying  
**[0:06:23-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:06:23):**  permaculture and practicing permaculture.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:06:25):**  And I still love nonfiction and documentary work.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:06:28):**  So for me, the podcast is a way to participate and actually be a creator and a producer,  
**[0:06:35-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:06:35):**  not just a consumer, but a producer in solutions-based nonfiction.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:06:41):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:06:42):**  I'm originally from Hawaii.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:06:47):**  I was born and raised there and I lived there until I was 18.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:06:51):**  And I actually couldn't wait to leave because it was such a small place and it was just  
**[0:06:59-0:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:06:59):**  what it was.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:07:00):**  And I would watch the TV and I would see all these amazing commercials for amusement parks  
**[0:07:05-0:07:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:07:05):**  and Fred Lobster and just all these types of businesses that we don't have on Maui.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:07:14):**  So I really wanted to leave.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:07:15):**  I wanted to move to a big city and then I did.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:07:17):**  And then after I had that experience of living away and experiencing a different culture  
**[0:07:22-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:07:22):**  and experiencing a place where people weren't so connected to the natural world around them,  
**[0:07:26-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:07:26):**  Maui and all that it taught me while I grew up there became really important to me.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:07:30):**  And so that's where my grounding in caring for the earth really comes from, is being  
**[0:07:37-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:07:37):**  blessed to have been brought up in a place where nature is gorgeous all around me and  
**[0:07:42-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:07:42):**  makes my day better every single day, just by being around it.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:07:45):**  And I've had the luck of getting to live in a lot of different places and some people  
**[0:07:50-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:07:50):**  just don't have that.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:07:51):**  That's just not the reality of a lot of different people.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:07:55):**  So that started really creating for me this understanding of how your reality shapes your  
**[0:08:01-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:08:01):**  worldview.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:08:02):**  And I like to tell a little story about this, which is if you have a fish that's swimming  
**[0:08:10-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:08:10):**  around and you ask that fish to describe what color of the water it is that they're swimming  
**[0:08:15-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:08:15):**  in, they're going to say, what water?  
**[0:08:18-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:08:18):**  Because they don't know they're in water.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:08:19):**  It's not until that fish is possibly caught and then makes it into the non-water world  
**[0:08:24-0:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:08:24):**  and then hopefully makes it back to its other water friends that it's going to be able to  
**[0:08:28-0:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:08:28):**  say, dude, we're swimming around in water.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:08:30):**  I didn't know it was there before.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:08:32):**  And that was me in Hawaii.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:08:33):**  I was swimming around in a certain water and then I had to leave and live someplace else  
**[0:08:37-0:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:08:37):**  and then come back to it in order to understand it.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:08:39):**  And that's one reason why I think the stories are really important is because when you hear  
**[0:08:46-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:08:46):**  about another person's experience or you hear about another person's worldview, not even  
**[0:08:50-0:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:08:50):**  the worldview, but like actually done within an experience, it opens up my mind, opens  
**[0:08:55-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:08:55):**  up my whole being really to another way of being and doing.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:09:00):**  So to take that down another level, I also grew up doing theater.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:09:05):**  And theater you're quite literally putting yourself into a different storyline and living  
**[0:09:10-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:09:10):**  it and experiencing it and trying to figure out what are the motivations of the different  
**[0:09:13-0:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:09:13):**  characters and you've got lighting and costumes and stage and a bunch of different people  
**[0:09:17-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:09:17):**  are working together to create this thing.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:09:20):**  And I just always loved that when I was little, I fell in love with theater for the first  
**[0:09:24-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:09:24):**  time when I was five, possibly earlier.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:09:29):**  And it was a huge part of my life and still is.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:09:31):**  And then when I moved away, I moved to Chicago, I went to Northwestern University and I studied  
**[0:09:37-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:09:37):**  theater there and theater was different there.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:09:40):**  It was a lot more professional.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:09:42):**  Whereas the school that I'd gone to beforehand for high school, theater is primarily community  
**[0:09:47-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:09:47):**  based.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:09:48):**  We're doing this as a community, whereas at Northwestern, it was, okay, the actors go  
**[0:09:52-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:09:52):**  here and the set designers go here and you shall not meet.  
**[0:09:55-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:09:55):**  And it was, it was a different experience.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:09:57):**  And there's, there's a lot going on in Chicago that ultimately somebody told me that it was  
**[0:10:04-0:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:10:04):**  okay that I was not feeling like I fit in there and like maybe I was having culture  
**[0:10:07-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:10:07):**  shock and maybe I actually fit back in more in Hawaii.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:10:09):**  And that was really helpful for me to hear.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:10:11):**  But ultimately while I was there, I learned that the professional theater paths of being  
**[0:10:18-0:10:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:10:18):**  an actor and going on auditions just really ground me down.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:10:24):**  But I still loved theater and I loved theater as an educational tool.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:10:29):**  Northwestern has an amazing children's theater department and an amazing creative drama department.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:10:35):**  And that's where I really started delving in and storytelling as well.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:10:37):**  I got to take professional storytelling classes in college.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:10:40):**  It was great.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:10:41):**  We'd sit around barefoot.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:10:42):**  Which I always thought was funny in Chicago in the winter when other people on the other  
**[0:10:46-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:10:46):**  side of campus are like learning about calculus and stuff.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:10:49):**  It was great.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:10:50):**  You'd like bring a guitar to class and we'd be singing together and it'd be so, so fun.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:10:54):**  I love school.  
**[0:10:55-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:10:55):**  What a contrast.  
**[0:10:56-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:10:56):**  It was awesome.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:10:57):**  And creative drama, what that is is you're using theater as an educational experience.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:11:03):**  So you're not just teaching kids about say the revolutionary war, something they're always  
**[0:11:08-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:11:08):**  going to learn about.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:11:09):**  Instead you have them acted out.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:11:10):**  Instead you have them pretend to be a soldier writing a letter home and taking all that  
**[0:11:15-0:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:11:15):**  stuff that they learned from a book and internalizing it and making it part of their own story.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:11:19):**  And then bringing it out.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:11:21):**  And I remember that they did this exercise where they asked us, what are the most, what  
**[0:11:26-0:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:11:26):**  are the memories that you have from school that you felt like you learned the most?  
**[0:11:30-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:11:30):**  And for every single one of us across the board, it was something experiential and something  
**[0:11:33-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:11:33):**  that was part of our own story.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:11:35):**  So that learning about it and creating curriculums about this type of thing and then teaching  
**[0:11:39-0:11:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:11:39):**  kids, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11 year olds and having them go through experiences.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:11:45):**  I remember we decided to shipwreck a bunch of kids, that was a lot of fun.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:11:50):**  Just really gave me this concrete understanding of stories inform our understanding of the  
**[0:11:55-0:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:11:55):**  world.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:11:56):**  So if you put those two things together, flash forward, I met this guy, Locksley, and he  
**[0:12:02-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:12:02):**  started showing me all these different documentaries and things.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:12:05):**  And I also, part of theater is that I understand story because I've just lived in a lot of  
**[0:12:09-0:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:12:09):**  different stories.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:12:10):**  So I understand how they kind of work on the human soul a little bit.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:12:15):**  I'm not the only one, but I'm grateful for that understanding and that perspective.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:12:19):**  So watching these documentaries about how terrible certain parts of the world is and  
**[0:12:23-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:12:23):**  how we're in this era at time of peak everything and nothing's really quite certain and there's  
**[0:12:30-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:12:30):**  a lot of terrible things that have happened and there's a lot of terrible things that  
**[0:12:33-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:12:33):**  still could happen.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:12:35):**  If you just leave people there like, oh, genocide, nothing else.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:12:43):**  It doesn't make people want to engage and make a difference.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:12:46):**  It doesn't make people want to engage and make a change and be part of the solution.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:12:50):**  And people are so busy that it takes a certain type of person that has the time and the bandwidth  
**[0:12:54-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:12:54):**  to think, okay, well, what are the solutions?  
**[0:12:56-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:12:56):**  Let me go after them.  
**[0:12:57-0:12:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:12:57):**  So instead, can we create experiences?  
**[0:12:59-0:13:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:12:59):**  Can we create content?  
**[0:13:00-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:13:00):**  Can we create stories that engage human resilience, resiliency of the human spirit?  
**[0:13:07-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:13:07):**  And so everything else I've done since there, usually under the realm, something I call  
**[0:13:12-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:13:12):**  social artistry.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:13:14):**  And that's a term that was coined by a woman named Jean Houston, who's a mentor of mine,  
**[0:13:18-0:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:13:18):**  but a lot of different people use it in a lot of different contexts.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:13:21):**  It's how do you use art and creativity and story to engage people in their potential  
**[0:13:27-0:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:13:27):**  of who they can be at this time on this planet?  
**[0:13:30-0:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:13:30):**  When we are being asked to really look at ourselves and make changes so that we can  
**[0:13:35-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:13:35):**  be living more resiliency, resiliently and regeneratively for generations to come.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:13:41):**  And so the podcast came about because I've been learning about permaculture with Laxley  
**[0:13:46-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:13:46):**  and I've been learning about social artistry.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:13:49):**  And these are things that if I engage somebody to sort of conversation, they wouldn't necessarily  
**[0:13:53-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:13:53):**  know what I'm talking about right away.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:13:54):**  Because they're kind of the concepts that require a little bit of theory and a little  
**[0:13:59-0:14:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:13:59):**  bit of a world perspective.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:14:01):**  And the best way, I think, to share that world perspective and to encourage people to think  
**[0:14:08-0:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:14:08):**  in these ways is to show and tell the stories of what it is in action and what it's done  
**[0:14:15-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:14:15):**  to a community, what it's done to a piece of land, what it's done to a person.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:14:20):**  And so that's where the podcast came from.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:14:22):**  I love that explanation.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:14:23):**  And I just want to give the listeners a little bit of a background.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:14:26):**  So over the new year, we're just a couple of weeks in, I have been thinking a lot about  
**[0:14:32-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:14:32):**  how I want to theme or redirect this publication for the upcoming season.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:14:38):**  And I was thinking about all these concepts of becoming a better listener through proactive  
**[0:14:43-0:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:14:43):**  means and learning how to ask the questions that get people to share and making them comfortable  
**[0:14:49-0:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:14:49):**  enough to be vulnerable and really give the information that connects with people on another  
**[0:14:52-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:14:52):**  level as well as the practical information that I focused on in previous seasons.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:14:58):**  And a lot of that comes along with storytelling in a way to engage people and have it connect  
**[0:15:03-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:15:03):**  with their experience in a way that just techniques and information on its own struggles to do  
**[0:15:08-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:15:08):**  or simply doesn't make that bridge.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:15:11):**  And you guys happen to show up on the scene in our tiny little area of Guatemala at exactly  
**[0:15:16-0:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:15:16):**  the right moment while I was trying to kind of culminate and clarify some of these contexts.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:15:22):**  And so tell me a little bit about the power of narrative in your own experiences and how  
**[0:15:31-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:15:31):**  it sort of connected you to these larger concepts of regeneration and holistic thinking.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:15:38):**  Yeah.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:15:39):**  So for me, in Spanish, the word historia means story and history.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:15:48):**  So my background is in history and it's about crafting the story of the past in a sense.  
**[0:15:55-0:16:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:15:55):**  That said, the way that my Western linear male mind always thought was very much in  
**[0:16:02-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:16:02):**  terms of facts and figures and dates and whatnot.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:16:07):**  And it was very, very much up in the head, although I felt like I could craft a good  
**[0:16:11-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:16:11):**  story with that.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:16:12):**  Now, I realized later on that that was a story that would resonate with certain types of  
**[0:16:18-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:16:18):**  minds that were more similar to my own and it didn't have great resonance.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:16:25):**  And so what I later found, especially around the year 2016 and the national conversation  
**[0:16:32-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:16:32):**  we were having in the United States at that time was that stories of the heart, actual  
**[0:16:40-0:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:16:40):**  stories that tug at people's heartstrings have resonance.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:16:44):**  And when you can combine those two, it has really powerful resonance.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:16:51):**  And one way I want to take that question to is this lowest common denominator, which is  
**[0:16:59-0:17:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:16:59):**  permaculture or what have you, or facts or information.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:17:03):**  We create them as humans to affect other humans and because it's part of our own story.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:17:09):**  And so if you take away anything and everything, you're left with a human being.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:17:13):**  And what is a human being, but a storyteller, the way that I choose to live my life, the  
**[0:17:17-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:17:17):**  way I choose to engage with other people, the things I choose to dress, the things I  
**[0:17:20-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:17:20):**  choose to watch, that's all me telling a story.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:17:24):**  And even more so than narrative, because when you do become aware of what your narrative  
**[0:17:28-0:17:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:17:28):**  is, then you start to be able to change it, which is really powerful in a person's life  
**[0:17:34-0:17:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:17:34):**  and live the life that you're wanting to live.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:17:37):**  Not everybody is aware that they can even do that, but once you are aware, then you  
**[0:17:40-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:17:40):**  can just start making those tiny little changes as an individual.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:17:44):**  That's really important.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:17:45):**  The thing that I find myself teaching people with even more gusto though is the listening,  
**[0:17:52-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:17:52):**  because listening is, it's that other part of storytelling.  
**[0:17:56-0:18:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:17:56):**  Like there is no, there is a story if somebody is not listening because maybe you're listening  
**[0:18:00-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:18:00):**  to yourself.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:18:02):**  But performance is not performance unless there's somebody receiving the performance.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:18:07):**  That's actually part of the origins of the word.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:18:11):**  And so knowing how to listen is such a huge part of making change in the world because  
**[0:18:18-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:18:18):**  one has to listen and observe, interact, listening as a type of interaction to what is happening  
**[0:18:24-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:18:24):**  now, what is actually happening, what were you saying to me?  
**[0:18:28-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:18:28):**  What am I saying?  
**[0:18:29-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:18:29):**  And can I really listen in a way and respond to you and tell you that I have heard you?  
**[0:18:35-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:18:35):**  And that is a foundational building block to peace, to change, to transformation in  
**[0:18:42-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:18:42):**  the ways that I think our communities need to transform.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:18:45):**  That led us to Story Bridge, which is one of the most sophisticated ways to do that  
**[0:18:50-0:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:18:50):**  that I've ever done.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:18:52):**  Definitely.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:18:53):**  I love that concept and I'm really excited to explore the Story Bridge even more.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:18:58):**  Can you talk a little bit first about how one can improve at listening and do so in  
**[0:19:03-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:19:03):**  an active way because oftentimes listening is thought of as you just sit there and receive  
**[0:19:09-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:19:09):**  information or you're just a vessel that is being filled with whatever is coming in.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:19:16):**  But there are active ways to listen and to actually coax out new experiences and new  
**[0:19:21-0:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:19:21):**  communications from someone.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:19:23):**  Totally.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:19:24):**  And what comes to mind immediately when you say that are two quick tips that I use all  
**[0:19:30-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:19:30):**  the time, which is if I'm listening to somebody and I want to coax out more information and  
**[0:19:36-0:19:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:19:36):**  maybe even guide the conversation so it's more resonant for both of us, I'll take a  
**[0:19:40-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:19:40):**  little bit of what I heard them say almost verbatim and then throw that out in the question  
**[0:19:44-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:19:44):**  that I just said.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:19:45):**  So they feel like they are listened to and then I'm moving in the other direction and  
**[0:19:49-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:19:49):**  I'm making it really easy for them to see the connections of the threads and like taking  
**[0:19:54-0:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:19:54):**  them along that path.  
**[0:19:55-0:19:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:19:55):**  It's like going to where they are in the conversation, holding their hand, being like, I see you  
**[0:19:58-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:19:58):**  and listening to where you are and hey, let's go this way.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:20:02):**  That's something I'll do.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:20:05):**  And perhaps even more concretely, something I'll do is a practice called deep listening,  
**[0:20:09-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:20:09):**  whether they know I'm doing it or not.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:20:11):**  And this is particularly great if you're having a conflict with somebody.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:20:16):**  We collaborate with each other.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:20:17):**  We do sometimes have conflicts and we use this on each other all the time.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:20:22):**  So what happens is I'll hear what their person is saying.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:20:26):**  And then I will say what I heard them say back.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:20:29):**  And I'll actually say what I heard you say or what I'm understanding from you is that  
**[0:20:35-0:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:20:35):**  you are frustrated because, okay, here's a concrete example of something that we did  
**[0:20:40-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:20:40):**  this morning.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:20:41):**  He wanted to leave the house at 9 30.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:20:44):**  I wanted to leave the house at whenever, maybe 9 30 and we did not communicate about that.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:20:48):**  So he was frustrated.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:20:49):**  And ultimately I said, like, I hear that you're frustrated because you wanted to leave the  
**[0:20:53-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:20:53):**  house at 9 30.  
**[0:20:55-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:20:55):**  Whereas I was thinking it doesn't really matter what time we leave.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:20:59):**  And that was really frustrating to you because you feel like you're that we're wasting time  
**[0:21:03-0:21:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:21:03):**  and that we're not showing up to against our word and all those things.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:21:06):**  And I understand that those things are really important to you.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:21:08):**  I'm sorry.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:21:09):**  Immediately, like the person can I like go, go back at you.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:21:14):**  Like it almost always ends the fight because the person's being seen in their experience  
**[0:21:19-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:21:19):**  being validated.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:21:20):**  And they know because I listened and then I actively repeated back what I heard.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:21:26):**  They know that they have been seen that they, that their point has come across and that  
**[0:21:30-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:21:30):**  I have the emotions that I have and they have the emotions and experience that they have  
**[0:21:34-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:21:34):**  based on something that we have concretely said, this is the reality of the situation  
**[0:21:39-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:21:39):**  and that's listening.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:21:40):**  And then we promptly congratulated each other for being on Guatemala time.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:21:45):**  Yes.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:21:46):**  There's a much more fluid concept of time here.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:21:49):**  And I struggle with that a lot myself.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:21:52):**  And there is another nuance aspect to this that I really, really like as well.  
**[0:21:55-0:22:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:21:55):**  This telling back what you heard the other person say is giving that person space to  
**[0:22:03-0:22:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:22:03):**  say yes or no and or yes and, and add a little bit more of the nuance of what they might've  
**[0:22:10-0:22:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:22:10):**  meant to say originally and that the cloud of whatever was in their head, you know, not  
**[0:22:16-0:22:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:22:16):**  having eaten or frustration or whatever didn't come through clearly that first time.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:22:22):**  So giving them also that space to respond back, not just, I heard you say this opportunity  
**[0:22:27-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:22:27):**  for clarification.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:22:28):**  Cause so often someone will say something and then we take that and we internalize it  
**[0:22:33-0:22:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:22:33):**  in our own story modes and our own conditionings.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:22:37):**  And then we start saying something else.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:22:38):**  That's our story in our own story modes and their own conditionings.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:22:41):**  And so then you have like one person talking and the other person talking without knowing  
**[0:22:46-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:22:46):**  for sure that the connection of listening and understanding has happened.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:22:49):**  So even if you repeat it back and you don't agree with them, it's always a great idea  
**[0:22:53-0:22:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:22:53):**  to repeat back what they said.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:22:54):**  So they know that you know what you're not agreeing to and then you can figure out where  
**[0:22:59-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:22:59):**  the agreement is.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:23:00):**  This is really powerful stuff.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:23:01):**  I can already see so many examples in our own group dynamics and conflicts here on the  
**[0:23:06-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:23:06):**  farm where that could have been something that really facilitated the communication  
**[0:23:10-0:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:23:10):**  and the understanding on both parties.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:23:13):**  Now I'm going to flip the switch on this a little bit.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:23:16):**  How can you communicate with somebody to make it easier for them to listen to you and make  
**[0:23:22-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:23:22):**  sure that you are heard?  
**[0:23:25-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:23:25):**  I mean within what you, we can actually control.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:23:28):**  Obviously you can't control someone else.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:23:30):**  Cause you just mentioned there that we hear, you know, definitely objectively the words  
**[0:23:36-0:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:23:36):**  or the communication that someone puts out there.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:23:38):**  But from there it goes through our own filters and it goes through our own sort of way of  
**[0:23:42-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:23:42):**  translating the information and we come to our own conclusions or take what we want from  
**[0:23:47-0:23:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:23:47):**  it.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:23:49):**  Oftentimes unconsciously.  
**[0:23:50-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:23:50):**  How can you, yeah, so it's a matter of trying to get your intended communication past the  
**[0:24:00-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:24:00):**  filter of the other person.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:24:02):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:24:03):**  Again, I really want to reemphasize that aspect of listening because it's almost like a gift  
**[0:24:09-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:24:09):**  giving culture, right?  
**[0:24:11-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:24:11):**  So you, if you're actively listening to that person and in a sense it's, it's maybe a bad  
**[0:24:17-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:24:17):**  metaphor, but picking your battles where you don't always have to speak up about every  
**[0:24:23-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:24:23):**  single little thing that's happening and just actively listening and show them that you're  
**[0:24:27-0:24:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:24:27):**  listening in time when it's my turn to speak.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:24:31):**  For example, I've noticed that the economy of my words being used less is actually maybe  
**[0:24:39-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:24:39):**  carries more weight in the sense that people are ready to actively listen to what I've  
**[0:24:44-0:24:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:24:44):**  had to say because it's, it's a reciprocal thing.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:24:47):**  I think.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:24:48):**  Totally.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:24:49):**  I love that analogy of the gift giving.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:24:50):**  That's how a lot of cultures work in this world.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:24:52):**  That's how Hawaii works too.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:24:53):**  So I've been learning a lot about that and that's one of my focuses of 2019.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:24:57):**  But when you listen to somebody, you're giving them a gift and like when you show that you've  
**[0:25:02-0:25:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:25:02):**  really listened to somebody and you really heard them, they feel like they've received  
**[0:25:05-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:25:05):**  a gift often.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:25:06):**  I know I do.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:25:07):**  And so then they want to do something for you.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:25:10):**  And so they're more set and primed to want to listen to you.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:25:13):**  So if you can, in a situation, listen to them first.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:25:16):**  Great.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:25:17):**  Then if you feel like you've already done a lot of listening and you still are not getting  
**[0:25:20-0:25:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:25:20):**  heard what I will do is I will be really clear about what our common goal is.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:25:28):**  So there's something to reach together.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:25:30):**  And so if I'm having a conflict and I'm not feeling heard, I can say, we don't have a  
**[0:25:35-0:25:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:25:35):**  conflict right now, but I would be like, okay, Oliver, I hear you.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:25:41):**  I hear that you're saying this and this and this.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:25:45):**  It's really important to me that we're able to work together in this.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:25:47):**  And part of that is that I need to feel like I'm being heard and I'm not being heard.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:25:51):**  I don't feel like I'm being heard.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:25:52):**  So I want to talk to you about what it is that I am experiencing and like what I need  
**[0:25:57-0:26:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:25:57):**  to be heard about.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:26:00):**  And that usually like primes them and makes it known to them like what we're about to  
**[0:26:06-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:26:06):**  share is really important and important to us achieving our goals together.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:26:09):**  So it kind of motivates them to want to listen.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:26:13):**  And I'm also aware that a lot of people don't know how to listen.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:26:18):**  And so I might even ask them, I'm going to say this and then I want you to repeat back  
**[0:26:23-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:26:23):**  what it is that I said so I know that I was heard.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:26:25):**  I've used that really effectively with kids before.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:26:27):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:26:28):**  It's a good kind of training method.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:26:29):**  We're just big kids.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:26:30):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:26:31):**  Totally.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:26:32):**  Totally.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:26:33):**  It is.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:26:34):**  The same tactics.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:26:35):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:26:36):**  It does.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:26:37):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:26:38):**  And if that still doesn't work, then I would really think, is this somebody I want to collaborate  
**[0:26:41-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:26:41):**  with?  
**[0:26:42-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:26:42):**  I mean, if it's a mentor, if I'm somebody who's like teaching them.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:26:44):**  Are they going to be able to meet me on my level?  
**[0:26:46-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:26:46):**  Exactly.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:26:47):**  Exactly.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:26:48):**  Like I couldn't have a relationship with somebody who can't listen really well.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:26:50):**  Along this line of keeping the conversation going and facilitating listening from both  
**[0:26:54-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:26:54):**  sides, definitely doing what you can to control, but also helping the other person to meet  
**[0:26:58-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:26:58):**  you halfway and ensure that you're being heard.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:27:01):**  I really would love your feedback or your insights on a concept that I've been fascinated  
**[0:27:06-0:27:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:27:06):**  by lately and usually comes in the form of a relationship to business.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:27:11):**  Have you heard of Simon Sinek?  
**[0:27:13-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:27:13):**  No.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:27:14):**  Okay.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:27:15):**  So he's a wonderful presenter and a thinker on healthier work environments and he comes  
**[0:27:19-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:27:19):**  through with the concept of the infinite or the finite game.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:27:23):**  And the basic idea is that finite games are really useful for things like sports where  
**[0:27:27-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:27:27):**  there's clearly defined rules and there is a start and a stop and there can be a winner  
**[0:27:32-0:27:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:27:32):**  or a loser.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:27:34):**  But the problem comes in is when people try to play infinite games, things like life or  
**[0:27:40-0:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:27:40):**  business or politics by infinite parameters, infinite or sorry, by by finite parameters  
**[0:27:47-0:27:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:27:47):**  where they pretend like there are agreed upon rules and that there is a stop and a start.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:27:52):**  So the concept of winning in business or defeating your competitors or winning in politics or  
**[0:27:58-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:27:58):**  even in relationships or communication.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:28:01):**  And instead of treating it and what I like the way that we're putting this in context  
**[0:28:05-0:28:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:28:05):**  right now is that of communication and especially relationships where if you are playing a relationship  
**[0:28:12-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:28:12):**  or let's say a conversation by finite rules where you're trying to get one up on the other  
**[0:28:21-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:28:21):**  person or be right or kind of make your point and then and then you win somehow.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:28:28):**  I know I have definitely done this in previous conversations where I like, oh, I can really  
**[0:28:33-0:28:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:28:33):**  show them I can I can be right in this case.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:28:36):**  I'll show them what I meant.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:28:38):**  Whereas if you switch that and play by infinite rules, it changes what the objective is, where  
**[0:28:44-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:28:44):**  instead of trying to make your point, the objective is to keep the conversation going,  
**[0:28:49-0:28:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:28:49):**  to keep conversation and communication alive and making sure that rather than winning in  
**[0:28:58-0:29:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:28:58):**  the conventional sense or making your point, you make sure that everyone feels heard and  
**[0:29:03-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:29:03):**  that communication continues on for as long as possible.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:29:06):**  And the relationships keep to build.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:29:08):**  Exactly.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:29:09):**  So how can stories be used as a tool to play relationships and communication more as an  
**[0:29:17-0:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:29:17):**  infinite game and give up on this concept of winning in them?  
**[0:29:21-0:29:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:29:21):**  No.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:29:22):**  That was a very loaded question.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:29:27):**  It's a very loaded question.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:29:28):**  And I like that context of the finite and the infinite.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:29:31):**  And I am a facilitator for different groups.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:29:34):**  And I just a little plug there.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:29:37):**  I've learned that it's really helpful to create finite spaces within the infinite and just  
**[0:29:41-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:29:41):**  have that going.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:29:42):**  And like, how can you make something explicit versus implicit?  
**[0:29:46-0:29:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:29:46):**  Like are there implicit rules going on here that not everybody in this space actually  
**[0:29:50-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:29:50):**  knows about?  
**[0:29:51-0:29:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:29:51):**  Those are really great things to pay attention to too.  
**[0:29:53-0:29:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:29:53):**  Assumptions, all that stuff.  
**[0:29:56-0:30:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:29:56):**  So I think what you're saying is how do you use storytelling and narrative to create more  
**[0:30:05-0:30:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:30:05):**  infinite situations where it's not I win, you win, but it's we both win and we keep  
**[0:30:10-0:30:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:30:10):**  this conversation going.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:30:11):**  Is that the question?  
**[0:30:12-0:30:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:30:12):**  Exactly.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:30:13):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:30:14):**  Okay.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:30:15):**  So I can't tell you concretely, but it's something that fascinates me.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:30:19):**  And that's one reason why I'm still interested in storytelling.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:30:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:30:23):**  Let's explore it together.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:30:24):**  And my best answer to this right now is creating a storytelling practice in the business.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:30:31):**  And because we are hard grained to listen to stories.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:30:37):**  One of my teachers and mentors and friends, his name is Richard Owen Gear and he's the  
**[0:30:44-0:30:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:30:44):**  creator of the story bridge method, which is something that we use on our podcasts and  
**[0:30:49-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:30:49):**  that we use to facilitate high quality spaces with people that are working together.  
**[0:30:55-0:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:30:55):**  High quality spaces of connection and listening and getting to know each other and getting  
**[0:30:58-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:30:58):**  to know the, the, the we message and the us message of a group in a space.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:31:03):**  It's a lot of fun.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:31:04):**  It's called story bridge.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:31:05):**  Uh, what he likes to say in his introductions to it is that we've been sitting around a  
**[0:31:11-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:31:11):**  fire telling stories for eons and like, imagine that you were a group of people crossing a  
**[0:31:17-0:31:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:31:17):**  desert and there was one oasis and that oasis had the trees and the water and all the things.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:31:22):**  And there was a group of people already there and they had that fire, et cetera.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:31:26):**  You've basically got two choices.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:31:28):**  Either you can fight that group of people or you can tell stories and by telling stories,  
**[0:31:33-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:31:33):**  you become relations with each other.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:31:35):**  That's a fantastic example.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:31:37):**  Yeah.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:31:38):**  Cultivating that practice of telling stories every day in your communities and your business  
**[0:31:45-0:31:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:31:45):**  and your schools and your churches everywhere.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:31:48):**  Cultivating a practice and really giving it that space and also yeah, having different  
**[0:31:53-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:31:53):**  structures and methods.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:31:54):**  Story bridges one, we use multiple, but story bridges is our latest favorite and it's where  
**[0:31:59-0:32:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:31:59):**  we want to take our podcasts in 2019 more down that path as well.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:32:03):**  But yeah, it's been a lot of fun.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:32:05):**  But yeah, without a doubt creating that space and having that space.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:32:08):**  Well, so let's explore this story bridge now because what you guys have been telling me  
**[0:32:13-0:32:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:32:13):**  about how you construct your podcasts and the messages that you try and get out there  
**[0:32:18-0:32:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:32:18):**  weaving around these narratives, I would love to explore more because it's given me a lot  
**[0:32:22-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:32:22):**  to aspire to in this podcast as well.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:32:25):**  So how do you want to, how do you want to pick this?  
**[0:32:28-0:32:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:32:28):**  So let's explain what story bridges is because there's some fun gems in there too that go  
**[0:32:33-0:32:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:32:33):**  beyond just deep listening.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:32:36):**  So what story bridge?  
**[0:32:38-0:32:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:32:38):**  What you usually do is you have a group of people.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:32:40):**  So the last story that we did was an organization all dedicated to school gardens and creating  
**[0:32:47-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:32:47):**  spaces for kids to learn about gardening in the school.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:32:52):**  So we chose to make a podcast out of that because it was something that we want more  
**[0:32:58-0:33:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:32:58):**  people to know about and want people to know the effects of in the community.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:33:03):**  And it's better than saying, Oh, well kids that do school gardens are 50% less likely  
**[0:33:08-0:33:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:33:08):**  or more 50% more likely to do whatever it might be.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:33:12):**  It makes more sense to have the people who are living this on a daily experience, explain  
**[0:33:15-0:33:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:33:15):**  those awesome, inspiring moments that they've experienced with the kids creating impact  
**[0:33:20-0:33:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:33:20):**  and for them to know that too.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:33:21):**  So we created the space for that to happen.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:33:23):**  So what is the story bridge?  
**[0:33:25-0:33:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:33:25):**  We had that group of people, that group was like 15, 16 people, but we can have groups  
**[0:33:30-0:33:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:33:30):**  as large as like a hundred really.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:33:32):**  It's scalable depending on what you're doing with it.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:33:35):**  And we made it the finite space in that everybody knew what the rules were in that space and  
**[0:33:42-0:33:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:33:42):**  like, well, the respect was a relationship, et cetera.  
**[0:33:46-0:33:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:33:46):**  But most importantly, we asked people to think of a personal story, a story from their own  
**[0:33:51-0:33:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:33:51):**  personal narrative.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:33:52):**  And we gave them a prompt.  
**[0:33:55-0:34:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:33:55):**  That prompt for them was talk about a moment in a school garden that you saw made a huge  
**[0:34:01-0:34:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:34:01):**  impact on a child's life.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:34:03):**  Roughly that was the prompt.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:34:05):**  It might've been slightly different worded.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:34:08):**  And then everybody got into groups of two.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:34:11):**  So you had one person talking to another person.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:34:14):**  So we had 16 people in the group.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:34:16):**  We had eight groups of two and each group of two is talking at the same time.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:34:21):**  And one person goes first and the other person's the listener.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:34:25):**  And for about three minutes, the first teller would tell the story from their own personal  
**[0:34:31-0:34:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:34:31):**  experience based on the prompt.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:34:36):**  And like the prompt is just to get people started and to get them into that general  
**[0:34:40-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:34:40):**  context of, Hey, we're all talking about the same thing here.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:34:43):**  It doesn't have to be specifically that prompt.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:34:45):**  And we told them that too, but more concrete details.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:34:48):**  And after the first person is told their story, the listener then tells that person's story  
**[0:34:56-0:35:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:34:56):**  back to them in the first person is if it happened to them.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:35:00):**  So for example, if I, if I was paired up with you, Oliver, and you were telling your story  
**[0:35:05-0:35:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:35:05):**  and I happened to know that you were your first place of living was in Japan.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:35:10):**  I might say when I'm telling your story back when I was a boy living in Japan, no, I'm  
**[0:35:15-0:35:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:35:15):**  not a boy, nor did I ever live in Japan, but I'm telling your story.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:35:19):**  And so that becomes I, and then that person, the listener tells that story back to the  
**[0:35:25-0:35:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:35:25):**  person who told it as if that narrative happened to them.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:35:29):**  And that's really cool because it really hard wires ourselves for compassion.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:35:34):**  It's like hacking people to be compassionate.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:35:37):**  So if you're sitting across from somebody who you might think is really different from  
**[0:35:41-0:35:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:35:41):**  you, and there's no win-win in with this person, if you're hearing them tell a story and you  
**[0:35:47-0:35:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:35:47):**  are telling that story back to them in the first person, you're going to have compassion  
**[0:35:52-0:35:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:35:52):**  and empathy for that person's story just because our brains are set up that way.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:35:57):**  And here I want to give a shout out to our good friend, Ching-Hong Wei, who's also a collaborator  
**[0:36:02-0:36:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:36:02):**  with us and with Richard and the Story Bridge Method.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:36:05):**  And she's actually done her PhD research on the positive community building effects of  
**[0:36:12-0:36:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:36:12):**  Story Bridge.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:36:13):**  And there's, she has amazing examples of her dissertation.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:36:18):**  And so then of course they trade places with the person who then told the person's story  
**[0:36:23-0:36:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:36:23):**  back to them, tells their own personal story.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:36:26):**  And then the person who was listening that time tells that story back in the first person.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:36:32):**  And there's always a connection that happens there.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:36:35):**  And I'm still playing with it.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:36:37):**  So sometimes I wonder like, okay, how much of this is a forced connection?  
**[0:36:40-0:36:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:36:40):**  How much of this really is an important connection?  
**[0:36:43-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:36:43):**  But regardless, every space I'm in where I do that with a group of people, it's kind  
**[0:36:49-0:36:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:36:49):**  of across the board, but there's always some pairs in that group where I can hardly get  
**[0:36:53-0:36:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:36:53):**  them to stop talking just because they have so connected and they've so received some  
**[0:36:57-0:37:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:36:57):**  type of nutritional inspiration from each other in that experience.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:37:03):**  And they're like hugging or I'll see people like wiping away tears.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:37:07):**  Like it just immediately gets to that heart centered place.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:37:12):**  And depending on what you're doing and about it really can help a group identify then what's  
**[0:37:15-0:37:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:37:15):**  important to it.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:37:16):**  So I did it in another context where what we were doing is trying to figure out, okay,  
**[0:37:20-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:37:20):**  how can we as a coalition be more attractive at including other people and making people  
**[0:37:25-0:37:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:37:25):**  feel comfortable being a part of this coalition.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:37:27):**  So I had them do a story of vision partners where they talked about a moment that you  
**[0:37:32-0:37:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:37:32):**  felt really included in the part of the group that meant something a lot to you.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:37:36):**  And then after that we wrote all this together in the group saying like what needs to be  
**[0:37:42-0:37:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:37:42):**  present for a group to feel really inclusive and really meaningful.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:37:46):**  And that group had no problem just like naming out all of the different things.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:37:50):**  And it was because I had them connected in their own personal narrative first, shared  
**[0:37:55-0:37:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:37:55):**  that as like, oh, this is really important with another person in that space.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:37:59):**  And then as a group, we made that brainstorm list.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:38:01):**  So every single person was engaged in the making of that list.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:38:04):**  So if they had just gone straight to the list, it wouldn't have come from such a heart centered  
**[0:38:08-0:38:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:38:08):**  place.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:38:09):**  It would have come from a brain centered place.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:38:10):**  And most probably all they've allowed us talkers would have contributed to the list.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:38:15):**  Engage in everybody's voice too because they've now been primed to speak and to be heard.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:38:21):**  See how important that would be.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:38:23):**  So that's the first part of Story Bridge.  
**[0:38:25-0:38:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:38:25):**  What's amazing for it is a community building tool.  
**[0:38:29-0:38:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:38:29):**  The part I just talked about is more like a one on one.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:38:32):**  But as a community building tool, then you have the group of two decide which story they  
**[0:38:37-0:38:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:38:37):**  feel because that group of two has told two stories.  
**[0:38:41-0:38:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:38:41):**  They have to now choose one story that they're going to continue to tell during that story  
**[0:38:45-0:38:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:38:45):**  telling session.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:38:46):**  That's the next stage.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:38:47):**  And it's not because either story is better or worse.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:38:50):**  Like it's not a win win thing.  
**[0:38:53-0:38:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:38:53):**  It's really about getting those two people to think about what is the effect of the story  
**[0:38:57-0:38:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:38:57):**  on both of us?  
**[0:38:59-0:39:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:38:59):**  What is the effect of the story on this group?  
**[0:39:01-0:39:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:39:01):**  What story do we feel needs to be told again in order to be the most impactful in this  
**[0:39:09-0:39:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:39:09):**  space, to be the most healing in this space?  
**[0:39:12-0:39:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:39:12):**  This is a story that needs to be told.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:39:14):**  So they create a consensus amongst themselves that they're going to choose one of those  
**[0:39:18-0:39:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:39:18):**  stories and then you have groups of two become groups of four that then have two stories  
**[0:39:22-0:39:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:39:22):**  in them.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:39:23):**  And then they do the process again until you've narrowed it down to about seven stories, no  
**[0:39:28-0:39:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:39:28):**  matter how large the group is.  
**[0:39:30-0:39:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:39:30):**  And then what really makes it story bridge, and this is particularly the, there's a website  
**[0:39:36-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:39:36):**  called storybridge.spaces, storybridge.spaces, where you can really learn more about the  
**[0:39:41-0:39:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:39:41):**  methodology there.  
**[0:39:42-0:39:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:39:42):**  That's Dr. Richard Gere, that's Dr. Ching Hong Wei.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:39:45):**  What they'll then do is they'll take those seven stories and they'll turn them into performance.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:39:51):**  And so you have the group that told the stories then actually perform the stories for a wider  
**[0:39:56-0:39:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:39:56):**  audience in the community.  
**[0:39:57-0:39:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:39:57):**  Embody the stories too.  
**[0:39:58-0:39:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:39:58):**  Embody the stories.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:39:59):**  So you have that juicy, awesome, we're here together for a purpose.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:40:03):**  We're going to collaborate to create these stories.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:40:05):**  And because the stories are the people who are in the room or the stories of people who  
**[0:40:09-0:40:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:40:09):**  are part of this process, there's such reverence for those stories, so much love for those  
**[0:40:14-0:40:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:40:14):**  stories.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:40:15):**  And it becomes a process of trust and a process of really seeing each other and really being  
**[0:40:19-0:40:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:40:19):**  there for each other that is deeply regenerative on the human aspect.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:40:23):**  Yeah, this is social permaculture, without a doubt.  
**[0:40:26-0:40:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:40:26):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:40:27-0:40:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:40:27):**  So do we want to go through one of these exercises now?  
**[0:40:31-0:40:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:40:31):**  Um, I, yes.  
**[0:40:33-0:40:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:40:33):**  Yeah, we do.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:40:35):**  And before we do, I just want to tell a little story about storybridge.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:40:38):**  Perfect.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:40:39):**  How it can make an effect.  
**[0:40:40-0:40:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:40:40):**  It's very meta.  
**[0:40:41-0:40:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:40:41):**  Yeah, it's very meta, right?  
**[0:40:43-0:40:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:40:43):**  So the first, I don't think, yeah, that's a good one.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:40:48):**  So the first community that really used this process is a small community in rural Georgia  
**[0:40:57-0:41:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:40:57):**  called Colquitt and Colquitt, Georgia about 25 years ago was facing when a lot of rural  
**[0:41:02-0:41:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:41:02):**  communities was facing in that a lot of people are moving out.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:41:06):**  They used to have industry.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:41:07):**  That industry was based on agriculture.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:41:09):**  The agriculture was shutting down.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:41:11):**  Like there was no more industry there.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:41:13):**  Urbanization was happening in terms that people were moving to urban areas and the small town  
**[0:41:18-0:41:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:41:18):**  didn't know how it was going to survive.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:41:21):**  And Richard Gere heard about this and he really wanted to explore the power of narrative,  
**[0:41:27-0:41:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:41:27):**  bringing people together on something that matters to them.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:41:30):**  And so he came down to Colquitt and he ultimately had people share stories and created a play  
**[0:41:36-0:41:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:41:36):**  out of the stories from that community.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:41:39):**  So it was really specifically based on the values that are transmitted through stories  
**[0:41:43-0:41:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:41:43):**  that was important to that community in Colquitt, Georgia.  
**[0:41:47-0:41:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:41:47):**  And it was also a very inclusive cast.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:41:49):**  So when he does these things, particularly when he did it in Colquitt, Georgia and some  
**[0:41:53-0:41:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:41:53):**  other places too, it's a cast that included young people like the age of seven up until  
**[0:41:59-0:42:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:41:59):**  older people the age of 90.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:42:01):**  You don't usually get that group of people and that whole spectrum of people hanging  
**[0:42:05-0:42:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:42:05):**  out together and doing something meaningful together.  
**[0:42:07-0:42:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:42:07):**  But that's what this did.  
**[0:42:08-0:42:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:42:08):**  It also included blacks and whites and anything in between in the same cast, which again,  
**[0:42:15-0:42:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:42:15):**  especially in that Colquitt, Georgia in the 70s, that doesn't happen very often.  
**[0:42:21-0:42:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:42:21):**  And all the stories are shared, all the stories are seen and they turn it into performance.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:42:25):**  And the part that I love about this is that when you do this, coincidences and synchronicities  
**[0:42:30-0:42:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:42:30):**  can pop up.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:42:32):**  And one of the coincidences and synchronicities was a little boy in that cast who was black  
**[0:42:38-0:42:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:42:38):**  loved firemen and there was a fire station right across from the hall.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:42:43):**  And so he used to just on all the breaks go and hang out right next to the fire station.  
**[0:42:47-0:42:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:42:47):**  So the fire chief started kind of getting to know him.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:42:49):**  He was the fire chief was really turned off to the whole story bridge idea and the creating  
**[0:42:54-0:42:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:42:54):**  stories in theater and like, what is this?  
**[0:42:55-0:42:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:42:55):**  No, I don't want anything to do with it.  
**[0:42:58-0:43:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:42:58):**  But for some reason, the fire chief ended up in the building doing one of the performances  
**[0:43:03-0:43:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:43:03):**  and he was captivated and he ended up not missing another performance ever since.  
**[0:43:07-0:43:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:43:07):**  So like, even though he didn't think that it was something that was worth his time,  
**[0:43:11-0:43:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:43:11):**  just being exposed to it a little bit, he then became a very avid story bridge proponent.  
**[0:43:17-0:43:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:43:17):**  And that little boy who was hanging out at the fire station was showing up so consistently,  
**[0:43:21-0:43:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:43:21):**  so consistently, so consistently that ultimately they started letting him sweep things or they  
**[0:43:25-0:43:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:43:25):**  started letting him show up on his bicycles with his other friends to go and fight fires  
**[0:43:29-0:43:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:43:29):**  in the community.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:43:30):**  And they were showing up with such regularity, more so than the volunteer firefighters in  
**[0:43:35-0:43:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:43:35):**  the village, in the town, that ultimately it led to desegregating the fire station in  
**[0:43:42-0:43:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:43:42):**  the community.  
**[0:43:45-0:43:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:43:45):**  And that town, Colquitt, Georgia, still does a story bridge play every single day.  
**[0:43:48-0:43:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:43:48):**  I mean, every single year, excuse me.  
**[0:43:51-0:43:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:43:51):**  And they've been doing it for the last 25 years and it's created a sense of identity  
**[0:43:54-0:43:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:43:54):**  for that community.  
**[0:43:55-0:43:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:43:55):**  And if you walk through Colquitt, Georgia, you'll see murals all over the place that  
**[0:43:58-0:44:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:43:58):**  are murals of the stories that have been told during story bridge.  
**[0:44:01-0:44:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:44:01):**  They don't call it story bridge.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:44:03):**  They call it swamp gravy because that is, um, like kind of their original stone soup.  
**[0:44:08-0:44:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:44:08):**  It's a dish that everybody knows out in Colquitt, Georgia, where you take the leftover fish  
**[0:44:14-0:44:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:44:14):**  droppings and you create a soup out of it by adding what you have on hand.  
**[0:44:18-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:44:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:44:19):**  So you're going to do a story bridge really quick?  
**[0:44:22-0:44:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:44:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:44:23):**  Yeah.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:44:24):**  That sounds good.  
**[0:44:25-0:44:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:44:25):**  So, uh, this is an experiment.  
**[0:44:29-0:44:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:44:29):**  Never done this live on a podcast before like this.  
**[0:44:32-0:44:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:44:32):**  Improvisation podcast and we'll just see how it goes.  
**[0:44:36-0:44:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:44:36):**  So I have a prompt for you because I know that you are a world traveler and I would  
**[0:44:42-0:44:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:44:42):**  love for you to tell me a story about two and a half, three minutes long.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:44:46):**  And um, then I'm going to tell that story back to you in the first person and see how  
**[0:44:51-0:44:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:44:51):**  that makes you feel.  
**[0:44:52-0:44:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:44:52):**  We can talk about it from there.  
**[0:44:54-0:44:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:44:54):**  Experiential, right?  
**[0:44:55-0:44:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:44:55):**  All right.  
**[0:44:56-0:45:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:44:56):**  So the question is, talk about a time when you were traveling somewhere and something  
**[0:45:02-0:45:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:45:02):**  happened that had a big impact on you.  
**[0:45:05-0:45:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:45:05):**  All right.  
**[0:45:06-0:45:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:45:06):**  I've had a lot of travel stories definitely that have a big impact.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:45:09):**  I'm just trying to find one with a good clean coat, a conclusion.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:45:12):**  A lot of them otherwise are open ended.  
**[0:45:15-0:45:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:45:15):**  Let me think for a second.  
**[0:45:17-0:45:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:45:17):**  And that's okay too.  
**[0:45:18-0:45:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:45:18):**  Um, what we usually take to tell people is that the stories that want to be told tend  
**[0:45:21-0:45:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:45:21):**  to kind of like stick in the gut and they often are the first one that you think of.  
**[0:45:25-0:45:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:45:25):**  The first one that bubbles up.  
**[0:45:26-0:45:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:45:26):**  Now you are the storyteller.  
**[0:45:27-0:45:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:45:27):**  You get to choose which story you want to tell.  
**[0:45:30-0:45:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:45:30):**  Um, but that first story tends to want to be told for a reason.  
**[0:45:37-0:45:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:45:37):**  Okay.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:45:38):**  And the time is right here if you want to.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:45:41):**  Oh, thanks.  
**[0:45:42-0:45:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:45:42):**  Or when the three minutes.  
**[0:45:45-0:45:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:45:45):**  So while you're thinking about it, I'll tell another story bridge story real quick.  
**[0:45:48-0:45:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:45:48):**  Um, I was doing a story bridge in Ashland, Oregon at a, um, transformative young leaders  
**[0:45:55-0:45:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:45:55):**  training.  
**[0:45:56-0:46:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:45:56):**  And, uh, I had a friend in that training, um, who, who had gone through a lot of things  
**[0:46:03-0:46:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:46:03):**  in his life and the story bridge that they had us do that time, the prompt, like I just  
**[0:46:06-0:46:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:46:06):**  gave you, I had us go really deep.  
**[0:46:08-0:46:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:46:08):**  It was like, talk about the, we started using that of force for these.  
**[0:46:14-0:46:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:46:14):**  And the metaphor was ultimately like, what was that time that you were so in the dark  
**[0:46:17-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:46:17):**  that there was no other place for you to go except to look through the light.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:46:21):**  Um, and a friend of mine ended up telling a really personal story.  
**[0:46:27-0:46:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:46:27):**  A lot of people did, but it was a story that he'd never shared before.  
**[0:46:29-0:46:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:46:29):**  And it had to do with really dark parts of our culture that we don't usually talk about.  
**[0:46:34-0:46:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:46:34):**  Um, he happened to have been sexually abused as a child.  
**[0:46:37-0:46:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:46:37):**  And that's the story that he told and how that that had played out in his family and  
**[0:46:41-0:46:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:46:41):**  family dynamics.  
**[0:46:42-0:46:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:46:42):**  And like really deeply, like these were wounds that had turned him into who he was today.  
**[0:46:49-0:46:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:46:49):**  And he ultimately made a choice to, um, look at that story differently.  
**[0:46:54-0:46:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:46:54):**  But for the first time, he really shared that story.  
**[0:46:58-0:47:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:46:58):**  And then he had that story shared back to him in the first person.  
**[0:47:01-0:47:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:47:01):**  And then that was the story that was chosen to then be turned into a performance.  
**[0:47:05-0:47:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:47:05):**  And he chose to play himself in that performance.  
**[0:47:07-0:47:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:47:07):**  Cause when you feel a performance, you don't have to be yourself.  
**[0:47:10-0:47:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:47:10):**  You could actually be the person who's the perpetrator rather than the victim or whatever  
**[0:47:13-0:47:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:47:13):**  you want to be.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:47:14):**  He chose to be himself.  
**[0:47:16-0:47:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:47:16):**  And then in that story, he, he changed it and he confirmed the reality that he wanted  
**[0:47:21-0:47:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:47:21):**  to have happen by having the last part of that be him having a reconciliation with his  
**[0:47:28-0:47:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:47:28):**  mom over all of that, which had happened, but by performing it, it became an even more  
**[0:47:32-0:47:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:47:32):**  real.  
**[0:47:34-0:47:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:47:34):**  And uh, that experience of taking something that was so deeply held within himself, that  
**[0:47:40-0:47:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:47:40):**  so often in our culture, they're wrapped up around shame.  
**[0:47:42-0:47:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:47:42):**  Like you just don't share it.  
**[0:47:43-0:47:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:47:43):**  There's just not a space for it.  
**[0:47:46-0:47:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:47:46):**  He got to share it and other people helped him share it.  
**[0:47:49-0:47:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:47:49):**  And so suddenly that burden wasn't so heavy on him and he was able to, um, to really transform.  
**[0:47:55-0:48:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:47:55):**  Um, and the phrase that came out during that process is many hands make light work.  
**[0:48:00-0:48:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:48:00):**  So it's like many hands lifting up the story, make it not so heavy on one person and makes  
**[0:48:05-0:48:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:48:05):**  it more of something that the community is looking at, which is ultimately a way that  
**[0:48:10-0:48:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:48:10):**  you change things that you do want to have change in a community.  
**[0:48:13-0:48:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:48:13):**  That's beautiful.  
**[0:48:14-0:48:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:48:14):**  Yeah.  
**[0:48:15-0:48:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:48:15):**  Do you have a story yet?  
**[0:48:16-0:48:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:48:16):**  I do have my story.  
**[0:48:17-0:48:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:48:17):**  All right.  
**[0:48:18-0:48:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:48:18):**  We're ready?  
**[0:48:19-0:48:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:48:19):**  Yes.  
**[0:48:20-0:48:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:48:20):**  Okay.  
**[0:48:21-0:48:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:48:21):**  So I have hitchhiked in a lot of different countries, but Laos was probably the one that  
**[0:48:27-0:48:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:48:27):**  I remember the clearest.  
**[0:48:29-0:48:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:48:29):**  So I was traveling with a buddy of mine from Canada, both two tall gangly white kids in  
**[0:48:35-0:48:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:48:35):**  the middle of Laos.  
**[0:48:37-0:48:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:48:37):**  And we decided to hitchhike kind of on a whim.  
**[0:48:40-0:48:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:48:40):**  We had booked a shuttle bus to take us to a border.  
**[0:48:44-0:48:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:48:44):**  And it turns out like in many other places in developing countries, that bus does not  
**[0:48:48-0:48:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:48:48):**  leave unless it's full and nobody was coming that day.  
**[0:48:51-0:48:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:48:51):**  So we either needed to wait for another extra day or find another way to get to the border.  
**[0:48:58-0:49:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:48:58):**  And we were like, well, we both hitchhiked before, how hard can it be?  
**[0:49:01-0:49:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:49:01):**  And so we stuck out our thumbs and got no ride.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:49:05):**  And a few more hours went by, no more rides.  
**[0:49:08-0:49:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:49:08):**  And finally, somebody who saw us standing on the side of the road came over and said,  
**[0:49:12-0:49:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:49:12):**  no, no, not like that.  
**[0:49:14-0:49:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:49:14):**  Not with your thumb out, but rather with your hand out waving towards you kind of in a downward  
**[0:49:19-0:49:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:49:19):**  motion.  
**[0:49:20-0:49:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:49:20):**  That's how you get rides here.  
**[0:49:22-0:49:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:49:22):**  And it took us about three minutes to get a ride that way.  
**[0:49:25-0:49:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:49:25):**  Turns out hitchhiking is a totally normal thing there.  
**[0:49:27-0:49:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:49:27):**  Everybody does it because not that many people have vehicles.  
**[0:49:30-0:49:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:49:30):**  They just don't stick out their thumbs.  
**[0:49:31-0:49:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:49:31):**  There's a different symbol for it.  
**[0:49:33-0:49:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:49:33):**  So we had a series of very haphazard rides, one where we were going through the mountains  
**[0:49:39-0:49:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:49:39):**  and within a few minutes it became clear that the brakes didn't really work on the truck  
**[0:49:44-0:49:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:49:44):**  we were in because as we started to go down the hills, the guy was like slamming on the  
**[0:49:49-0:49:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:49:49):**  brake pedal and we were slowing down minorly and then careening around those turns.  
**[0:49:55-0:49:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:49:55):**  How we didn't die that time.  
**[0:49:56-0:49:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:49:56):**  I still don't know.  
**[0:49:58-0:50:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:49:58):**  And then we finally got picked up by a pickup truck and we're riding in the back of the  
**[0:50:02-0:50:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:50:02):**  cab out in the open air like, oh, this is phenomenal.  
**[0:50:06-0:50:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:50:06):**  This is really beautiful.  
**[0:50:07-0:50:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:50:07):**  We're going through all this gorgeous countryside forested mountain lands and all of a sudden  
**[0:50:11-0:50:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:50:11):**  we started smelling smoke.  
**[0:50:12-0:50:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:50:12):**  I'm like, huh, someone must be having a fire or something.  
**[0:50:17-0:50:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:50:17):**  Because at the same time we're going through all of these small communities where it's  
**[0:50:20-0:50:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:50:20):**  basically just little wood and thatch huts.  
**[0:50:23-0:50:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:50:23):**  The villages were really, really basic.  
**[0:50:24-0:50:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:50:24):**  Oh, they probably just cook with fire.  
**[0:50:27-0:50:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:50:27):**  And then there was a lot of smoke and there was even more.  
**[0:50:31-0:50:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:50:31):**  And to the point where we pretty much couldn't see out of this open truck cab.  
**[0:50:37-0:50:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:50:37):**  And we kind of turned around and we could see flames off in the distance.  
**[0:50:40-0:50:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:50:40):**  We were about to drive through a forest fire and we were not inside the truck.  
**[0:50:45-0:50:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:50:45):**  We were just in the open back outside, which did not seem to concern our driver in the  
**[0:50:50-0:50:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:50:50):**  least.  
**[0:50:52-0:50:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:50:52):**  So we kept driving through this forest fire and off the side we see people like throwing  
**[0:50:57-0:50:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:50:57):**  sand on it.  
**[0:50:59-0:51:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:50:59):**  And I'm like, this is the solution?  
**[0:51:01-0:51:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:51:01):**  And then after that we saw a guy with an AK-47 supervising the people who were throwing sand  
**[0:51:07-0:51:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:51:07):**  on the fire.  
**[0:51:08-0:51:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:51:08):**  And I was like, oh, there's probably a backstory here that I don't want to investigate.  
**[0:51:14-0:51:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:51:14):**  Let's keep driving.  
**[0:51:15-0:51:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:51:15):**  And it did get pretty hot as we were driving and very smoky and tough to breathe.  
**[0:51:19-0:51:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:51:19):**  But fortunately we got through it before it got too hot and before we started to suffocate.  
**[0:51:25-0:51:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:51:25):**  So that was fortunate.  
**[0:51:26-0:51:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:51:26):**  It was quite a thing to observe.  
**[0:51:28-0:51:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:51:28):**  I still make up backstories in my head, but we finally ended up getting to the border.  
**[0:51:35-0:51:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:51:35):**  And just before the border was going to close, we got our visas, we got through.  
**[0:51:40-0:51:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:51:40):**  And the only way to get down into the nearest village was to catch a ride with one of the  
**[0:51:44-0:51:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:51:44):**  migrant workers who sort of crossed the border regularly selling things from one side or  
**[0:51:48-0:51:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:51:48):**  the other.  
**[0:51:49-0:51:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:51:49):**  And they had these big loaded up motorcycles.  
**[0:51:52-0:51:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:51:52):**  So each one of us paid a motorcycle driver a bit of money to take us down the mountain  
**[0:51:58-0:52:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:51:58):**  and into Vietnam.  
**[0:52:00-0:52:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:52:00):**  And the conclusion that I actually have on this is borders are made up.  
**[0:52:06-0:52:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:52:06):**  We've completely invented them.  
**[0:52:09-0:52:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:52:09):**  They're geopolitical lines that we've drawn on a map.  
**[0:52:12-0:52:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:52:12):**  Sometimes they correspond with geographical features like mountain ranges or rivers.  
**[0:52:17-0:52:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:52:17):**  And sometimes they're purely political.  
**[0:52:20-0:52:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:52:20):**  Now, though the lines themselves might be made up, over time we make them real.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:52:26):**  Crossing from forest fire unregulated Laos on dirt roads, all of a sudden everything  
**[0:52:32-0:52:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:52:32):**  was paved, nice and clean.  
**[0:52:35-0:52:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:52:35):**  And the towns and the settings were just completely different.  
**[0:52:39-0:52:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:52:39):**  And this is when I kind of internalized because I had done a lot of traveling before this,  
**[0:52:43-0:52:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:52:43):**  but mostly it was making jumps by plane.  
**[0:52:46-0:52:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:52:46):**  I very rarely was crossing borders that were over land.  
**[0:52:51-0:52:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:52:51):**  And when I was, it was in places where it wasn't extremely different, but this is when  
**[0:52:56-0:53:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:52:56):**  I realized that imaginary borders can be made real over time.  
**[0:53:00-0:53:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:53:00):**  Thank you for that story.  
**[0:53:04-0:53:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:53:04):**  All right.  
**[0:53:05-0:53:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:53:05):**  So caveat, I'm usually really good at this.  
**[0:53:08-0:53:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:53:08):**  I'm also hungry, so I'm going to do the best I can.  
**[0:53:12-0:53:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:53:12):**  We got snacks.  
**[0:53:13-0:53:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:53:13):**  You want some snacks?  
**[0:53:14-0:53:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:53:14):**  We can tell it together and we can fill in bits of food.  
**[0:53:19-0:53:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:53:19):**  I think I'll be okay though.  
**[0:53:21-0:53:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:53:21):**  That's something I love to do.  
**[0:53:23-0:53:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:53:23):**  All right.  
**[0:53:24-0:53:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:53:24):**  So a while ago I was traveling through the country of Laos and I was traveling with a  
**[0:53:29-0:53:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:53:29):**  friend of mine.  
**[0:53:30-0:53:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:53:30):**  So we're like these two big gangly white dudes traveling through Laos and we wanted to cross  
**[0:53:38-0:53:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:53:38):**  the border into what country?  
**[0:53:40-0:53:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:53:40):**  Vietnam.  
**[0:53:41-0:53:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:53:41):**  We wanted to cross the border into Vietnam.  
**[0:53:43-0:53:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:53:43):**  And so we've hired a shuttle to do this and we found the shuttle and we were on the shuttle.  
**[0:53:50-0:53:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:53:50):**  And like in many developing countries, we found that this shuttle wasn't going to leave  
**[0:53:53-0:53:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:53:53):**  unless it was full of people and nobody else was coming that day.  
**[0:53:56-0:53:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:53:56):**  So we needed a different plan.  
**[0:53:58-0:54:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:53:58):**  Either we had to stay another day or we could hitchhike.  
**[0:54:02-0:54:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:54:02):**  So we decided to try hitchhiking and we stood on the side of the road and we stuck out our  
**[0:54:06-0:54:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:54:06):**  thumbs and cars kept passing and cars kept passing and nobody was picking us up.  
**[0:54:11-0:54:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:54:11):**  And we didn't really want to think about that.  
**[0:54:13-0:54:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:54:13):**  But then somebody told us, no, no, no, that's not how you hitchhike here.  
**[0:54:17-0:54:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:54:17):**  How you hitchhike here is you stick out your hand and you wave towards yourself.  
**[0:54:22-0:54:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:54:22):**  And within three minutes we caught a ride.  
**[0:54:24-0:54:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:54:24):**  Ends up that hitchhiking is super, super common in Laos.  
**[0:54:27-0:54:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:54:27):**  There's just a different symbol for it.  
**[0:54:31-0:54:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:54:31):**  And so we got a ride and we're riding through and maybe we've gotten multiple rides.  
**[0:54:38-0:54:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:54:38):**  But ultimately we ended up on a truck that didn't have very good brakes and we didn't  
**[0:54:43-0:54:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:54:43):**  know they didn't have brakes until we started going downhill and we saw that the guy driving  
**[0:54:46-0:54:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:54:46):**  had to pound on those brakes a lot and we were not slowing down like hardly at all.  
**[0:54:52-0:54:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:54:52):**  I'm still happy that I survived that one.  
**[0:54:55-0:54:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:54:55):**  I'm not really sure how I did, but thank you.  
**[0:54:58-0:55:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:54:58):**  And another thing that happened is that we started smelling smoke and we're going past  
**[0:55:03-0:55:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:55:03):**  all these different villages, et cetera.  
**[0:55:04-0:55:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:55:04):**  And we're like, okay, maybe somebody is cooking something, but there's a lot of smoke.  
**[0:55:08-0:55:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:55:08):**  And ultimately we realized that we're about to go through a forest fire and that this  
**[0:55:16-0:55:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:55:16):**  is definitely an issue because we're not even on the inside of the vehicle.  
**[0:55:20-0:55:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:55:20):**  Me and my friend are on the outside of the vehicle and this doesn't seem to bother the  
**[0:55:23-0:55:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:55:23):**  guy at all.  
**[0:55:25-0:55:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:55:25):**  And so we start driving through this forest fire and we're on the outside of the vehicle.  
**[0:55:29-0:55:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:55:29):**  So it's super smoky and there's fire and it starts getting hotter and we see people throwing  
**[0:55:33-0:55:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:55:33):**  sand on it.  
**[0:55:34-0:55:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:55:34):**  And you can see somebody with an AK-47 guarding the sand.  
**[0:55:38-0:55:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:55:38):**  Greatfully, we should have had that one too.  
**[0:55:40-0:55:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:55:40):**  It didn't suffocate.  
**[0:55:41-0:55:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:55:41):**  And when we got to the border and we crossed the border, everything changed really quickly.  
**[0:55:46-0:55:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:55:46):**  As in suddenly the roads were paved.  
**[0:55:48-0:55:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:55:48):**  Suddenly the villages that we saw were a lot more developed.  
**[0:55:51-0:55:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:55:51):**  And this really struck home to me that though borders are made up, like there's just lines  
**[0:55:56-0:56:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:55:56):**  that somebody has drawn and it's not something that exists in nature, but it's something  
**[0:56:01-0:56:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:56:01):**  that exists in our geopolitical climate.  
**[0:56:06-0:56:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:56:06):**  They can become real over time because when we crossed into Vietnam, I could really see  
**[0:56:10-0:56:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:56:10):**  the difference in people and places that made me understand that humans can make the borders  
**[0:56:17-0:56:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:56:17):**  come real over time.  
**[0:56:19-0:56:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:56:19):**  Marvelous.  
**[0:56:20-0:56:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:56:20):**  That was really impressive.  
**[0:56:22-0:56:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:56:22):**  Well done.  
**[0:56:23-0:56:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:56:23):**  You told that better than I did.  
**[0:56:26-0:56:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:56:26):**  Storytelling, you know, you did a great job.  
**[0:56:30-0:56:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:56:30):**  So how did it make you feel?  
**[0:56:31-0:56:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:56:31):**  To hear a story being told back to you that happened to you?  
**[0:56:34-0:56:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:56:34):**  That was something new, especially from the perspective of my own first person perspective  
**[0:56:39-0:56:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:56:39):**  coming from someone else was impactful.  
**[0:56:42-0:56:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:56:42):**  What made it impactful?  
**[0:56:45-0:56:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:56:45):**  Reliving that through your interpretation.  
**[0:56:48-0:56:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:56:48):**  And I could tell that you don't have the visuals that I do when I'm telling that story, but  
**[0:56:52-0:56:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:56:52):**  I could see you sort of forming them in a linear way from the way that I told it.  
**[0:56:58-0:56:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:56:58):**  Yeah.  
**[0:56:59-0:57:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:56:59):**  And that happens when you are the teller of somebody else's story.  
**[0:57:01-0:57:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:57:01):**  Suddenly I have visuals for things that I didn't live.  
**[0:57:04-0:57:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:57:04):**  They might not be your visuals, but I will have them just because I'm talking about it  
**[0:57:09-0:57:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:57:09):**  as if it happened to me and the visuals to start happening.  
**[0:57:11-0:57:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:57:11):**  Yeah.  
**[0:57:12-0:57:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:57:12):**  Those are remarkable.  
**[0:57:13-0:57:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:57:13):**  So that just hard wires people for compassion.  
**[0:57:16-0:57:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:57:16):**  Like, I feel like now I know a little bit more about you.  
**[0:57:18-0:57:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:57:18):**  I know more about what's really important and impactful to you, which is a way that  
**[0:57:23-0:57:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:57:23):**  you view the world and the way that you're experiencing the world and how that affects  
**[0:57:29-0:57:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:57:29):**  your perspectives and opinions about the world.  
**[0:57:31-0:57:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:57:31):**  That's super vague, but I think you know where I'm getting at that.  
**[0:57:35-0:57:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:57:35):**  Yeah.  
**[0:57:36-0:57:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:57:36):**  Nice.  
**[0:57:37-0:57:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:57:37):**  All right.  
**[0:57:38-0:57:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:57:38):**  So working with these exercises, how have you implemented them in different spaces,  
**[0:57:44-0:57:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:57:44):**  not just for the podcast, but within the communities that you engage with and what do you see as  
**[0:57:49-0:57:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:57:49):**  kind of the goal of connecting people on these story levels?  
**[0:57:53-0:57:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:57:53):**  Yeah.  
**[0:57:55-0:58:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:57:55):**  So one of the ones that we did in Houston, which was really a lot of fun was one called  
**[0:58:04-0:58:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:58:04):**  We All Gotta Eat.  
**[0:58:06-0:58:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:58:06):**  And it was about healthy local food and our experiences with food and food culture in  
**[0:58:13-0:58:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:58:13):**  general.  
**[0:58:14-0:58:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:58:14):**  And do you want to talk a little bit about, I don't remember the exact prompt for that  
**[0:58:20-0:58:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:58:20):**  one, but.  
**[0:58:21-0:58:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:58:21):**  Oh gosh, I don't remember the exact prompt either.  
**[0:58:23-0:58:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:58:23):**  I just remember the question that I was investigating and that was like, how can more people have  
**[0:58:31-0:58:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:58:31):**  access to healthy local food?  
**[0:58:33-0:58:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:58:33):**  Yeah.  
**[0:58:34-0:58:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:58:34):**  In general, I think when we explore these questions together, again, getting back to  
**[0:58:41-0:58:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:58:41):**  the statistical part of it.  
**[0:58:42-0:58:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:58:42):**  Say, for example, we have X number of people suffering from obesity or X number of people  
**[0:58:47-0:58:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:58:47):**  suffering from malnutrition.  
**[0:58:49-0:58:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:58:49):**  I think that resonates with a certain type of mindset and those facts can be better bolstered  
**[0:58:57-0:59:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:58:57):**  by a real heartfelt story.  
**[0:59:00-0:59:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:59:00):**  And so what this process does and these processes do is they elicit those stories out of the  
**[0:59:06-0:59:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:59:06):**  community.  
**[0:59:07-0:59:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:59:07):**  There's stacking functions.  
**[0:59:08-0:59:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:59:08):**  That's what I like about it in a social permaculture sort of way because you have the group of  
**[0:59:12-0:59:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:59:12):**  people that are telling the stories and they're getting the benefit of being really listened  
**[0:59:15-0:59:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:59:15):**  to.  
**[0:59:16-0:59:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:59:16):**  So that also means that they're learning how to listen, which as we talked about before,  
**[0:59:20-0:59:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:59:20):**  that is one of the foundational building blocks of creating changes, creating people that  
**[0:59:24-0:59:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:59:24):**  know how to listen.  
**[0:59:25-0:59:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:59:25):**  And so that happens in these experiences right off the bat.  
**[0:59:28-0:59:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:59:28):**  Second thing is it creates that space for people to share their narrative and have their  
**[0:59:33-0:59:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:59:33):**  narrative be validated and have that narrative connect for themselves in some big way in  
**[0:59:39-0:59:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:59:39):**  terms of what has meaning for them and what they choose to have meaning.  
**[0:59:42-0:59:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:59:42):**  So that's awesome for the people in it.  
**[0:59:44-0:59:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:59:44):**  Thirdly, the people in the space that are creating a performance together.  
**[0:59:48-0:59:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:59:48):**  And mind you, Storybridge does not always have to be a performance.  
**[0:59:52-0:59:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:59:52):**  Storybridge Spaces, that is always ending a performance.  
**[0:59:56-0:59:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:59:56):**  We've been exploring with it ending in a podcast instead.  
**[0:59:58-1:00:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:59:58):**  But the group of people that are creating the performance suddenly have bonds that weren't  
**[1:00:03-1:00:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:00:03):**  there before.  
**[1:00:04-1:00:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:00:04):**  And they have relationships that then can go on to do something else and be something  
**[1:00:08-1:00:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:00:08):**  else, which is important.  
**[1:00:10-1:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:00:10):**  If you've got multiple communities coming together to tell stories, that's a beneficial  
**[1:00:14-1:00:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:00:14):**  thing.  
**[1:00:15-1:00:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:00:15):**  And then finally, you have them sharing these personal stories out to the wider community,  
**[1:00:20-1:00:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:00:20):**  which creates this space, which is a celebration as well as an investigation of things that  
**[1:00:26-1:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:00:26):**  are important to that local community.  
**[1:00:29-1:00:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:00:29):**  Or in this case, we are really investigating local food and bringing that attention and  
**[1:00:34-1:00:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:00:34):**  that spotlight that arts can do, that creative events can do to local food.  
**[1:00:40-1:00:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:00:40):**  And what that is and what are the stories in our community right now, right here.  
**[1:00:45-1:00:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:00:45):**  And those stories can be inspirational, those stories can be sad, those stories can be impactful  
**[1:00:49-1:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:00:49):**  in all the different ways that stories can be.  
**[1:00:50-1:00:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:00:50):**  But it's very real and very authentic.  
**[1:00:52-1:00:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:00:52):**  And everybody in the audience gets to experience that and take that home.  
**[1:00:56-1:01:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:00:56):**  And that's what effect that that story performance had, which I think is hilarious and amazing,  
**[1:01:03-1:01:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:01:03):**  is a dear friend of ours who was part of the story ultimately decided that he did not want  
**[1:01:07-1:01:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:01:07):**  to be living in Houston anymore because that's how we did it.  
**[1:01:10-1:01:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:01:10):**  He'd been thinking about leaving for a while and he did leave because he wanted to be living  
**[1:01:15-1:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:01:15):**  a life that was more alive for him, I suppose, and the things that the story bridge had brought  
**[1:01:20-1:01:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:01:20):**  up for him.  
**[1:01:21-1:01:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:01:21):**  And he's still living in South America somewhere.  
**[1:01:23-1:01:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:01:23):**  Like he just like that was the impetus, the catalyst that had him move.  
**[1:01:27-1:01:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:01:27):**  And for me personally, too, I'm working with a metaphor, maybe of a handful of seeds.  
**[1:01:32-1:01:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:01:32):**  And this process is a series of seeds that you can go and sow.  
**[1:01:36-1:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:01:36):**  And one of the things that's reaped from it, I believe, is what Ching Hong has expressed  
**[1:01:42-1:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:01:42):**  in her research, that of empathy.  
**[1:01:44-1:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:01:44):**  When I go in the either in the telling the story back in the first person and in addition  
**[1:01:51-1:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:01:51):**  to that, also the part where we embody the stories that have happened in a theatrical  
**[1:01:56-1:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:01:56):**  performance, that embodiment of that story that exists in that room, we're not talking  
**[1:02:03-1:02:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:02:03):**  about some far off Greek god, we're talking about this person in front of you that you  
**[1:02:08-1:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:02:08):**  now know, you can see, you can smell, you can touch, etc.  
**[1:02:13-1:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:02:13):**  I, in a sense, lived their story in that enactment that we do in the story bridge process.  
**[1:02:20-1:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:02:20):**  And that for me, cultivated such a sense of great sense of empathy for that other person  
**[1:02:26-1:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:02:26):**  that I have found very, very, very difficult in all other aspects of my life and my culture  
**[1:02:35-1:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:02:35):**  to feel that depth of empathy.  
**[1:02:39-1:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:02:39):**  It's a process where my story becomes our story and the our story happens.  
**[1:02:44-1:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:02:44):**  And in certain cases, when you can have a really strong our story, our mission, our  
**[1:02:50-1:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:02:50):**  vision, what is important to us, that is what can keep the ducks flying in the formation  
**[1:02:55-1:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:02:55):**  and moving towards the same direction at the same time.  
**[1:02:59-1:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:02:59):**  And Ching Hong Wei as well, she did her PhD dissertation on the Colquitt, Georgia, that  
**[1:03:05-1:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:03:05):**  town that's been doing story bridge for the last 25 years together.  
**[1:03:09-1:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:03:09):**  And her dissertation proved in the ways that social sciences like to prove things that  
**[1:03:15-1:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:03:15):**  it was an urban planning and urban development, that Colquitt, Georgia had more resiliency  
**[1:03:22-1:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:03:22):**  within it.  
**[1:03:23-1:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:03:23):**  She had more benchmarks of how she was measuring the resiliency than other small towns of its  
**[1:03:27-1:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:03:27):**  size, of its similar history that were around it.  
**[1:03:31-1:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:03:31):**  And a lot of that had to do with the coming together and telling stories.  
**[1:03:34-1:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:03:34):**  I can imagine.  
**[1:03:35-1:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:03:35):**  Now, before we wrap things up, because I've got to attend to a few things on the farm.  
**[1:03:40-1:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:03:40):**  Talk to me a little bit about how one can invite more storytelling and better listening  
**[1:03:46-1:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:03:46):**  in their own lives.  
**[1:03:48-1:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:03:48):**  That's a good question, my friend.  
**[1:03:52-1:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:03:52):**  So Rhapsody is really, in my mind, a wealth of knowledge on a lot of different techniques,  
**[1:04:00-1:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:04:00):**  including story bridge.  
**[1:04:02-1:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:04:02):**  And I would first and foremost reiterate giving space for story.  
**[1:04:08-1:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:04:08):**  And like you were mentioning to me earlier today, building a table, right?  
**[1:04:13-1:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:04:13):**  So having a physical space, obviously, for story, but then also the meal is a place for  
**[1:04:21-1:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:04:21):**  a powerful place for a story that you don't even necessarily have to have some fancy advanced  
**[1:04:27-1:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:04:27):**  technique or go to a training on how to do just serve somebody a meal or have a meal  
**[1:04:32-1:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:04:32):**  with another person and sit across from them and the stories will emerge.  
**[1:04:36-1:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:04:36):**  So having a physical space and a temporal space for it, I think is the first key that  
**[1:04:41-1:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:04:41):**  anybody can take.  
**[1:04:42-1:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:04:42):**  Yeah.  
**[1:04:43-1:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:04:43):**  And to add to that a couple more things, definitely creating a space for it.  
**[1:04:47-1:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:04:47):**  When you're telling stories, you're creating culture.  
**[1:04:50-1:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:04:50):**  And one way that you can do that is by repeating certain stories that are important to your  
**[1:04:55-1:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:04:55):**  mission and vision of whatever it is you're creating.  
**[1:04:57-1:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:04:57):**  So Grand Hasekim, for example, or Abundant Edge.  
**[1:05:01-1:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:05:01):**  If you have a story of something that's happened here that is really like just a great story  
**[1:05:06-1:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:05:06):**  at depicting and sharing the experience of the values that you hold dear here, share  
**[1:05:10-1:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:05:10):**  that story, share that story, share that story amongst each other, amongst any person that  
**[1:05:15-1:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:05:15):**  comes to your farm.  
**[1:05:16-1:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:05:16):**  So that story starts to identify with your organization in a way that you can just go  
**[1:05:22-1:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:05:22):**  a little bit deeper and help people connect to what you're doing here.  
**[1:05:26-1:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:05:26):**  So that's one way you can do it to create more of a cultural vision.  
**[1:05:30-1:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:05:30):**  The other way that you can do it is to create that space within the rhythm of a week for  
**[1:05:36-1:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:05:36):**  there to be shared stories.  
**[1:05:38-1:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:05:38):**  So one way I've seen some families do it is, and I personally really like, is sharing that  
**[1:05:46-1:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:05:46):**  moment of impact.  
**[1:05:47-1:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:05:47):**  That's not what I mean.  
**[1:05:50-1:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:05:50):**  Sharing like a highlight of your week and have it be a practice of sharing a highlight  
**[1:05:54-1:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:05:54):**  of your week.  
**[1:05:55-1:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:05:55):**  Some people like to call it peaks and valleys.  
**[1:05:56-1:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:05:56):**  Some people like to call it roses and thorns.  
**[1:05:58-1:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:05:58):**  We actually did that with Laksu's family over the Christmas holiday.  
**[1:06:03-1:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:06:03):**  We were sitting there and eating Christmas dinner and we had everybody go around and  
**[1:06:08-1:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:06:08):**  share what was the things that you want to celebrate about 2018 and every single person  
**[1:06:14-1:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:06:14):**  went around and just shared a little bit and it wasn't a full developed story, but it absolutely  
**[1:06:19-1:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:06:19):**  gave me more inkling into what's going on with these people who maybe I only see once  
**[1:06:22-1:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:06:22):**  a year.  
**[1:06:23-1:06:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:06:23):**  And you can do that on a weekly basis, like just creating that space to really listen  
**[1:06:29-1:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:06:29):**  to those stories.  
**[1:06:30-1:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:06:30):**  And even small little, I guess you would say finite structures, putting it to there and  
**[1:06:34-1:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:06:34):**  having a clear basis of rules beforehand.  
**[1:06:37-1:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:06:37):**  Like we said, okay, we're going to go clockwise and everybody's going to get a chance to speak.  
**[1:06:42-1:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:06:42):**  And there was just a minimal amount of facilitation when one person was starting to cross talk  
**[1:06:48-1:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:06:48):**  over another, it's like, okay, now it's this person's turn.  
**[1:06:51-1:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:06:51):**  And that didn't happen very often, but sometimes a little bit of structure and giving people  
**[1:06:57-1:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:06:57):**  a heads up too, you know, it helps.  
**[1:06:59-1:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:06:59):**  And then we went around and we did what are you most excited about for 2019 for example.  
**[1:07:06-1:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:07:06):**  And it gives us things to connect in with those people about.  
**[1:07:09-1:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:07:09):**  And one more when it comes to your group of people working on something together, making  
**[1:07:15-1:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:07:15):**  cultural norms explicit is really important.  
**[1:07:18-1:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:07:18):**  And I think that that's particularly important for that deep listening exercise that I talked  
**[1:07:22-1:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:07:22):**  about before.  
**[1:07:23-1:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:07:23):**  And like next time that you have a group meeting with a group of people that you want there  
**[1:07:27-1:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:07:27):**  to be more listening, introduce that practice and say, I think listening can really help  
**[1:07:33-1:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:07:33):**  us achieve our goals together so we can really know that we're being seen and heard.  
**[1:07:36-1:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:07:36):**  I learned this way of doing it.  
**[1:07:40-1:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:07:40):**  Can we practice this real quick so that we can try it?  
**[1:07:44-1:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:07:44):**  And so then you invite somebody in your group to talk about what's on their mind for two  
**[1:07:49-1:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:07:49):**  minutes and then you repeat back to them, not I, but just what I heard you say is that  
**[1:07:54-1:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:07:54):**  you've been working on this and this and this, and that this is a challenge that you're facing  
**[1:07:58-1:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:07:58):**  and that this is something that's going really well for you.  
**[1:08:00-1:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:08:00):**  And then give that person a chance to reflect back on anything else that maybe you've missed.  
**[1:08:05-1:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:08:05):**  And then you've showed people what listening is and you're inviting people to be part of  
**[1:08:11-1:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:08:11):**  creating that cultural norm in your community.  
**[1:08:14-1:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:08:14):**  I love these insights.  
**[1:08:15-1:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:08:15):**  I can tell already I'm going to go back over this episode a few times to kind of mind these  
**[1:08:20-1:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:08:20):**  and hopefully kind of remind myself and find ways to put them in practice.  
**[1:08:25-1:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:08:25):**  I can see very clear crossovers already of some of the concepts we've talked about and  
**[1:08:30-1:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:08:30):**  how it can affect even like the infrastructure that we put in.  
**[1:08:33-1:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:08:33):**  And, you know, always I look at things through a design perspective and how can you design  
**[1:08:38-1:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:08:38):**  for storytelling?  
**[1:08:40-1:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:08:40):**  How can you create the infrastructure and the space, not only within the built world,  
**[1:08:45-1:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:08:45):**  but within time to invite these sort of connections and invite the vulnerability and the sharing  
**[1:08:51-1:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:08:51):**  from other people to really connect in that way.  
**[1:08:54-1:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:08:54):**  So thank you so much for making the time to come here.  
**[1:08:58-1:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:08:58):**  It's been so much fun just getting to know you both.  
**[1:09:01-1:09:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:09:01):**  I hope we stay in contact and know that you always have a home here at Grand Haciq.  
**[1:09:04-1:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:09:04):**  If you ever come to Maui, let us know.  
**[1:09:06-1:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:09:06):**  I certainly will.  
**[1:09:07-1:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:09:07):**  Maybe we can set up a workshop somehow in the future.  
**[1:09:09-1:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:09:09):**  That would be really fun.  
**[1:09:11-1:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:09:11):**  Let's do it.  
**[1:09:13-1:09:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:09:13):**  So before I let you go completely, could you let our listeners know how they can get in  
**[1:09:16-1:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:09:16):**  touch with you and find some of your resources?  
**[1:09:19-1:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:09:19):**  Sure.  
**[1:09:20-1:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:09:20):**  We have a website, which is www.storyconnective.org.  
**[1:09:28-1:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:09:28):**  And that's connective like connective tissue.  
**[1:09:30-1:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:09:30):**  That's one way you can remember it.  
**[1:09:32-1:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:09:32):**  You can find our podcast on any of your favorite podcasts, apps, except Spotify.  
**[1:09:38-1:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:09:38):**  We don't seem to be on that one yet.  
**[1:09:39-1:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:09:39):**  I know I got to work on that one too.  
**[1:09:41-1:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:09:41):**  Which is silly because that's where I get all my podcasts.  
**[1:09:45-1:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:09:45):**  It's very hypocritical.  
**[1:09:46-1:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:09:46):**  I actually uploaded my first podcast before I ever downloaded a podcast.

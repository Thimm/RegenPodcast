**[0:01:26-0:01:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:01:26):**  people to do when starting any land-based project is to start a plant nursery.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:01:32):**  Not only will you get to start the long process of coaxing plants into maturity, which is  
**[0:01:35-0:01:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:01:35):**  really worth beginning as soon as possible, but also you can learn valuable plant care

**[0:02:01-0:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:02:01):**  where they're going to grow up, so that they get the chance to acclimate rather than suffer  
**[0:02:05-0:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:02:05):**  a harsh adjustment from the heated greenhouse and chemical fertilizers that are so common

**[0:02:21-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:02:21):**  plants.

**[0:03:26-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:03:26):**  What are some of the characteristics, aside from just an unusual specimen, that you look  
**[0:03:31-0:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:03:31):**  for when you're selecting seeds or propagation material from your surrounding environment?  
**[0:03:37-0:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:03:37):**  So for me, I really like things that add to wildlife habitat or things that are just...  
**[0:03:46-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:03:46):**  I like things that are a lot.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:03:49):**  Some people are really into flavor or ornamental quality.  
**[0:03:55-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:03:55):**  So whatever you're really into, maybe you see something that's just covered in these  
**[0:03:59-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:03:59):**  flowers that are fairly significant.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:04:02):**  But for me, it's always like, oh my God, you can't even see the ground there because so  
**[0:04:06-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:04:06):**  many nuts fell down.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:04:09):**  I like that abundance.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:04:10):**  I like seeing overwhelming abundance.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:04:14):**  I like seeing a tree that's making 20 times as heavy a crop as all the other trees around  
**[0:04:22-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:04:22):**  it of the same species.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:04:24):**  So when I see a tree doing something exceptional like that, where it's just more than loaded,  
**[0:04:31-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:04:31):**  it's more than a heavy crop, it's a ridiculous crop, then that tree will not...  
**[0:04:36-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:04:36):**  It will leave my brain.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:04:37):**  I'll know it.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:04:39):**  And so, yeah, I think that's mostly what I look for is just like really...  
**[0:04:43-0:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:04:43):**  And then I also look at the quality of the food, like hickories.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:04:48):**  I like finding hickories that have big nuts.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:04:51):**  That's pretty exciting to me.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:04:53):**  Yeah, I've learned to do similar things, especially here with my partner, since I moved here to  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:04:57):**  Spain, there's fig trees everywhere and they have a pretty long fruiting season, depending  
**[0:05:02-0:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:05:02):**  on the variety.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:05:03):**  And every time we go to a new area or just a new region and find a new tree, yeah, you  
**[0:05:10-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:05:10):**  pick out all the best fruit and you're like, okay, I'm gonna come back in February and  
**[0:05:13-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:05:13):**  get some cuttings from that.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:05:15):**  The best one I've found so far was growing right next to a bunch of dumpsters outside  
**[0:05:20-0:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:05:20):**  of a town somewhere.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:05:22):**  And I'll always remember that tree because it had figs like the size of my fist and I  
**[0:05:26-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:05:26):**  went back to go get some cuttings.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:05:28):**  Yeah, that's awesome.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:05:30):**  And in Spain, it's like, there must be figs that people planted centuries ago that just...  
**[0:05:36-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:05:36):**  And then the homestead was abandoned and there's just gotta be so many varieties to discover.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:05:42):**  There really is.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:05:43):**  And especially with those really long living ones, you'll get olive trees around here that  
**[0:05:47-0:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:05:47):**  are easily 500 plus years old and you can just see in these massive trunks.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:05:52):**  The fig trees are cool because they go propagating themselves by layering and you'll get a whole  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:05:58):**  bunch of kids just sprouting up from when the branches got too heavy.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:06:03):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:06:04):**  And they'll readily...  
**[0:06:06-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:06:06):**  Those are...  
**[0:06:07-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:06:07):**  Figs are really easy to propagate and really satisfying.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:06:10):**  You can turn one plant into a lot pretty fast.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:06:13):**  Yeah, you certainly can.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:06:15):**  That's definitely one I would recommend from my own experiences of an easy one to build  
**[0:06:19-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:06:19):**  your confidence.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:06:20):**  Right.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:06:21):**  Yeah, if I was in a warmer climate, I would be all over figs.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:06:25):**  Oh man, I gotta send you a book about growing figs in cold climates.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:06:29):**  There's hope for you.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:06:30):**  Isn't that the Lee Wright book?  
**[0:06:31-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:06:31):**  Yeah, it's the same one.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:06:33):**  Cool.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:06:34):**  Okay, so let's focus back on one of the unique things about your own orchard and nursery  
**[0:06:41-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:06:41):**  is that you claim that since you're really adamant about not using any chemicals, fertilizers,  
**[0:06:46-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:06:46):**  or even minimal amounts of plastic when it's avoidable, how do you manage the fertility  
**[0:06:51-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:06:51):**  and ensure that the trees get a good start?  
**[0:06:54-0:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:06:54):**  I assume this goes back to what your advice was on spending money on building soil.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:06:59):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:07:00):**  Well, for one thing I'll say is trees don't need a lot of fertility compared to vegetables  
**[0:07:06-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:07:06):**  or flowers.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:07:07):**  In fact, they can do pretty well with really low fertility.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:07:12):**  They'll just grow a little bit slower, which is often better, at least in northern climates.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:07:19):**  Because if you have really high fertility in the north, what happens is the tree grows  
**[0:07:25-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:07:25):**  really fast and it's really fun, but then it doesn't stop growing in the late summer.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:07:33):**  And then we'll get a frost and the wood will not have hardened off properly and you'll  
**[0:07:38-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:07:38):**  get a significant amount of winter dieback.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:07:41):**  So in a lot of my beds, I'm actually trying to reduce fertility because I have added so  
**[0:07:46-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:07:46):**  much compost over the years that the beds are too fertile.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:07:50):**  So now I'm actually doing things like adding untreated charcoal, not bio charges, charcoal,  
**[0:07:57-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:07:57):**  sawdust, just things to soak up the nitrogen because they actually have too much.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:08:04):**  But I think the best thing that you can really do for tree fertility is fungal dominated  
**[0:08:12-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:08:12):**  soils, which is going to be lots of carbon, wood chips, sawdust, and leaves, stuff like  
**[0:08:21-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:08:21):**  that, and then less disturbance, the least amount of disturbance possible.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:08:26):**  So I just try to keep my soils really carbon heavy.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:08:30):**  And I don't ever buy fertilizer for trees ever.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:08:39):**  I would think that would be a bad idea to be honest.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:08:43):**  Even if it was organic or not.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:08:46):**  Well, yeah, so it might give you the look or the aesthetics that a customer might like  
**[0:08:52-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:08:52):**  when they receive the plant material, I guess, but even then you're selling them with...  
**[0:08:58-0:09:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:08:58):**  Well, it wouldn't for my customers because I'm just selling bare root plants that are  
**[0:09:02-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:09:02):**  dormant.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:09:03):**  Yeah, that's probably the best.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:09:04):**  If I was selling stuff in the summer in a pot, then yes, you're right.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:09:07):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:09:08):**  But since they're going to lose all their leaves anyway, you're harvesting them in the  
**[0:09:10-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:09:10):**  dormant stage, even that doesn't really matter.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:09:13):**  And if they're going to have all that dieback, you're selling to a different clientele at  
**[0:09:17-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:09:17):**  this point.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:09:18):**  You're not just selling these beautiful, mostly mature trees with a whole bunch of root-bound  
**[0:09:23-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:09:23):**  roots in a small pot.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:09:25):**  These are more for people who understand the value of healthy genetic material that can  
**[0:09:31-0:09:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:09:31):**  grow more or less wildly.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:09:33):**  And I would imagine at much lower maintenance for the way that it was raised in the beginning.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:09:38):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:09:40):**  I think that I'm really lucky that we have pre-educated customer base and that they understand  
**[0:09:49-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:09:49):**  they're getting fairly small trees compared to what you see outside of box stores.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:09:57):**  Most of our stuff is probably like two feet tall and just with a nice healthy root system.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:10:04):**  And there's no pot, there's no soil and there's no leaves.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:10:08):**  So it just looks like a stick with some roots really.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:10:13):**  But they grow, they grow well.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:10:16):**  So let's go back to the differences between growing a regular annual garden of vegetables  
**[0:10:22-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:10:22):**  and such and growing trees like this.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:10:26):**  I would imagine that the maintenance is quite a bit different too.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:10:29):**  And what does that look like throughout different seasons and different points of necessary  
**[0:10:34-0:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:10:34):**  maintenance for the business side throughout the year?  
**[0:10:37-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:10:37):**  Well, I'm pretty cold climate.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:10:41):**  I'm in New York state zone five.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:10:44):**  So it gets, I guess a lot of people are in Europe.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:10:48):**  I don't know Celsius that well, but it gets to about negative 15, negative 20 Fahrenheit,  
**[0:10:55-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:10:55):**  which is way below zero Celsius.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:10:59):**  And so our winters are fairly extreme and pretty long.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:11:04):**  We get our first frost, usually the first week in October.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:11:09):**  And then our last frost will be in like the middle of May, usually sometimes later.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:11:19):**  And so basically in the spring, as soon as the ground thaws, I'm planting, I'm putting  
**[0:11:28-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:11:28):**  seeds in and there's different species, right?  
**[0:11:32-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:11:32):**  So some species I don't put in until after danger of frost and some I put in right away.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:11:38):**  And then so early April, as soon as the ground thaws out, I'm planting and then we're also  
**[0:11:44-0:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:11:44):**  shipping.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:11:46):**  Pretty much all of April is just planting and shipping.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:11:49):**  And then May we're still planting stuff and then we're actually starting to weed.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:11:57):**  It rains a lot here and we get a lot of weeds.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:12:01):**  And then May, June, July, August is really just a lot of maintenance.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:12:05):**  It's not even that much work to be honest.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:12:07):**  Like it's as much work as I want it to be.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:12:10):**  Usually I just start taking on other projects around the farm and make it more work, but  
**[0:12:16-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:12:16):**  it doesn't have to be.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:12:17):**  Like if it's just an nursery and you're just like, I just wanted to grow some trees and  
**[0:12:20-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:12:20):**  make some money, then you would just start your beds in the spring, plant a bunch of  
**[0:12:25-0:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:12:25):**  seeds or cuttings out, let them grow all summer.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:12:29):**  At the end of the summer or in the fall, they go dormant.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:12:33):**  Then I dig them up, count them, grade them, decide what I'm going to list on the website  
**[0:12:39-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:12:39):**  and then they get healed in.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:12:41):**  So I just put them in a bundle and bury them back into the earth, but they're already dug  
**[0:12:46-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:12:46):**  up.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:12:47):**  So when spring comes and I'm taking orders, somebody got five of this elderberry and 10  
**[0:12:54-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:12:54):**  of that chestnut, just go and grab those trees.  
**[0:12:57-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:12:57):**  I don't have to dig them back up.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:12:58):**  They're just in these piles under some dirt.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:13:04):**  So let me start over.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:13:08):**  I'll make it really simple.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:13:10):**  So spring, planting, summer, sweeting and mulching, fall is digging up the trees and  
**[0:13:15-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:13:15):**  then winter is nothing.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:13:20):**  If all I was doing was digging up trees and selling trees and I'm just trying to make  
**[0:13:26-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:13:26):**  a living for myself, then I think it would only be like, once your beds are built, it's  
**[0:13:34-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:13:34):**  not that much work.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:13:36):**  Having a 10-hour workweek would be plenty for most of the year other than the shipping  
**[0:13:44-0:13:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:13:44):**  season.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:13:45):**  That is quite a bit of work.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:13:47):**  So what are the tasks then that take most of your time?  
**[0:13:50-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:13:50):**  Is it really just fulfilling orders and making sure that they get out in that shipping you  
**[0:13:53-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:13:53):**  were just talking about?  
**[0:13:54-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:13:54):**  Or are there a couple of hot seasons and it goes in waves like that?  
**[0:13:59-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:13:59):**  Yeah, I mean, fulfilling orders takes the most time by far.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:14:07):**  And then digging up the plants themselves takes a lot of time.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:14:12):**  The bigger the plants are, the more time it takes because you have to take more care and  
**[0:14:18-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:14:18):**  it's harder to get them out of the ground and stuff.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:14:21):**  If you're growing stuff that's two or three years old, it can be pretty heavy digging.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:14:28):**  So yeah, nothing really feels like that much work, to be honest.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:14:33):**  I know everyone says farming is so hard, but I don't think it's that hard.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:14:38):**  I don't know.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:14:39):**  Maybe I'm stupid or something.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:14:40):**  I don't know.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:14:41):**  Maybe I'm missing something.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:14:42):**  Well, you do have a kind of unique focus for your farm.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:14:46):**  What's that?  
**[0:14:47-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:14:47):**  You do kind of have a unique focus for your farm.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:14:51):**  It's not like you're trying to get a ton of beef cattle out the door.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:14:54):**  Right.  
**[0:14:55-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:14:55):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:14:56):**  Maybe it's like, cause you're selling, like you dig up a chestnut tree and it takes you  
**[0:15:01-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:15:01):**  like a minute and it's, you know, it's like a $10 tree where if you're digging up a carrot,  
**[0:15:06-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:15:06):**  it might take, if you're doing it by hand, it's almost the same amount of time.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:15:11):**  But it's worth a lot more than the carrot.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:15:13):**  So I think a vegetable farmer has to work harder.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:15:16):**  Like they have to sell more plants that they've dug up.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:15:20):**  Then a nursery stock is worth a lot of money.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:15:24):**  And a lot of that is because of the genetics involved.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:15:28):**  Most of that is having access to really exciting genetics, exciting to your customers.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:15:34):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:15:36):**  Now, how do you handle the sales and the marketing part of your plants?  
**[0:15:41-0:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:15:41):**  You touched on this a little bit at the beginning, how you sort of built up a market and buyers  
**[0:15:45-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:15:45):**  from pretty unconventional methods, kind of just selling on Craigslist and then getting  
**[0:15:50-0:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:15:50):**  a part of different groups and planting societies.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:15:54):**  What is the main strategy that you have now?  
**[0:15:57-0:16:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:15:57):**  Are you mostly coasting off of the relationships that you built earlier on?  
**[0:16:02-0:16:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:16:02):**  I think we have like a pretty good presence on the internet through our website.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:16:08):**  It gets enough hits that it shows up in Google searches.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:16:12):**  So if somebody in the United States is just Googling anything about chestnut trees and  
**[0:16:17-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:16:17):**  they read far enough, they're going to find our page.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:16:22):**  Same for mulberries or pretty much any of the trees that I've written about enough make  
**[0:16:28-0:16:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:16:28):**  it so that I think we get enough Google hits that it just shows up.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:16:36):**  That's weird.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:16:38):**  Sorry.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:16:39):**  Google thing.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:16:40):**  I think they said that word.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:16:44):**  Yeah, they heard you talking about it.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:16:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:16:48):**  But no, I think just the internet presence.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:16:52):**  I used to go on forums and try to promote our website and tell people that I had this  
**[0:16:58-0:17:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:16:58):**  farm, but I haven't tried to do that in a really long time because the internet presence  
**[0:17:08-0:17:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:17:08):**  is so much bigger than my little farm can handle really.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:17:12):**  It's just a little farm.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:17:14):**  It's just supporting me and a couple of people, but it's reaching tens of thousands of people.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:17:23):**  It's a little bit out of balance in a good way, but it's a little obscene sometimes.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:17:30):**  Well, I guess I didn't even ask that.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:17:33):**  Give the listeners some idea of the scale and the volume that you're at.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:17:36):**  So how big is the farm and about how many yearlings assume is what you tend to sell  
**[0:17:43-0:17:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:17:43):**  of tree stock?  
**[0:17:45-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:17:45):**  So it's a 20 acre farm and the nursery takes up one acre and we probably raised 20,000  
**[0:17:55-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:17:55):**  plants on it for sale every year.  
**[0:17:57-0:17:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:17:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:17:58):**  So you're not even using a fraction of that to actually cultivate in the nursery itself.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:18:03):**  The other 19 acres are focused on other things?  
**[0:18:08-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:18:08):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:18:09):**  So I'm just planning lots of orchards and stuff for fun, but also really for plant stock,  
**[0:18:17-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:18:17):**  to be able to develop our own seed strains and have cuttings.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:18:23):**  I'm building a plant collection up there.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:18:27):**  So there's over a hundred varieties of berries and a lot of different...  
**[0:18:32-0:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:18:32):**  There's probably six or seven acres of chestnuts, huge genetic expression in them, three acres  
**[0:18:40-0:18:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:18:40):**  of hazelnuts.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:18:41):**  And then there's a lot of these mixed orchards with persimmons and elderberries and just  
**[0:18:45-0:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:18:45):**  like every kind of weird fruit I could think of.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:18:49):**  And I just add to it every year.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:18:52):**  And it's kind of cool because I'm just looking around at different nurseries that I like  
**[0:18:58-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:18:58):**  and I'm like, oh, they have new variety this year, this or that, or this thing I've never  
**[0:19:02-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:19:02):**  tried and then it grow and if it grows well, then we can grow it out.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:19:06):**  Then we can take cuttings from it and propagate it, or we can just sell cuttings from it.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:19:12):**  And then there's just all the fruit and nuts that's just another bonus.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:19:18):**  But the nursery pays for the orchards to exist and then the orchards then feed the nursery  
**[0:19:25-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:19:25):**  and make it stronger and better.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:19:27):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:19:28):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:19:29):**  It's great how those things work together.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:19:32):**  Now, I'm curious, you were talking about developing new genetics and such.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:19:36):**  What are the projects that you're working on at the moment that you're most excited  
**[0:19:39-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:19:39):**  about and see a future for?  
**[0:19:42-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:19:42):**  Probably the two biggest things that I really think are happening, there's a lot of different  
**[0:19:49-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:19:49):**  ideas, but the biggest things that are actually happening right now is chestnut flour and  
**[0:19:54-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:19:54):**  hazelnut oil.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:19:57):**  And that's because I'm part of a co-op.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:20:00):**  So there's a group of us, I think there's probably 10 growers in it.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:20:04):**  It's called the New York Tree Crops Alliance.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:20:07):**  And we just been working together and we're building a nut processing facility.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:20:13):**  So we got like an oil press and we got some cracking machines and we just got this huge  
**[0:20:18-0:20:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:20:18):**  grant.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:20:19):**  So we're going to buy a bunch more processing equipment.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:20:22):**  That's like really exciting to see.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:20:26):**  And then within the chestnut and hazelnut production, there's also the genetics of those  
**[0:20:34-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:20:34):**  two genuses that I'm pretty excited about.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:20:39):**  I've been planting chestnuts on that hill for a while now and hazelnuts as well.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:20:45):**  And the whole time, every year I've been adding as many different strains as I can.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:20:53):**  And so now I'm starting to see some of those things bear nuts.  
**[0:20:57-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:20:57):**  And it's kind of cool because they weren't clones that I put in, they were all seedlings.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:21:03):**  There are some clones, but there's a lot of seedlings.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:21:06):**  And so you don't really know what they're going to do.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:21:08):**  Like somebody from Michigan sent me like 20 seeds 10 years ago and now I'm like, oh, that's  
**[0:21:14-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:21:14):**  what these do.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:21:15):**  And it's kind of exciting.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:21:17):**  And then you can cross them with others and you can make all kinds of exciting new trees.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:21:22):**  Yeah, I really liked that aspect about the way that you propagate these is that you really  
**[0:21:28-0:21:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:21:28):**  do go for the genetic diversity, whereas most, I guess nurseries of any kind focus mostly  
**[0:21:35-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:21:35):**  on particular varieties that have a commercial use and they just clone those for the most  
**[0:21:40-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:21:40):**  part.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:21:41):**  What's the importance about creating this larger genetic base to sell things, but also  
**[0:21:48-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:21:48):**  to propagate for your own interests?  
**[0:21:51-0:21:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:21:51):**  I think there's a good place for clones for sure.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:21:56):**  But I like the genetic expression of seedlings because it is so different.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:22:02):**  There's things that they will have that we don't even know are problems yet.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:22:08):**  They have solutions to problems that haven't yet arisen.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:22:12):**  So like, for example, there's all these different species of chestnut and one of them is the  
**[0:22:20-0:22:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:22:20):**  Ozark chinkapin, is one's very rare and obscure species of chestnut, but it just happens to  
**[0:22:27-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:22:27):**  be the only one in the world that is resistant to chestnut gall wasp, which just showed up  
**[0:22:34-0:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:22:34):**  in our area.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:22:35):**  So it's kind of cool.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:22:36):**  If you have these hybrids and these hybrid swarms, basically, trees that have the genetics  
**[0:22:45-0:22:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:22:45):**  of eight different species of chestnut in them, then they have all of these...  
**[0:22:52-0:22:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:22:52):**  Because the way I think of genetics is kind of like knowledge.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:22:56):**  So if you have a Chinese chestnut...  
**[0:23:01-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:23:01):**  So all...  
**[0:23:02-0:23:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:23:02):**  So let me back up.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:23:03):**  All chestnuts start in one place, in my opinion.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:23:06):**  There was one area where the genus formed and this tree made a spiky bur with chestnuts  
**[0:23:12-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:23:12):**  in it, and then its population got segmented by continental drift and mountain ranges and  
**[0:23:18-0:23:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:23:18):**  all kinds of whatever factors happen and these species got separated.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:23:22):**  And then you now you have these ones in America and ones in Japan and ones in Europe, but  
**[0:23:28-0:23:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:23:28):**  all this time passes and while they're separated from each other, they learn to adapt to different  
**[0:23:33-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:23:33):**  things.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:23:34):**  So the Japanese chestnut is out there and it's learning all about chestnut blight, the  
**[0:23:40-0:23:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:23:40):**  fungus, cryphonectria, parasitica, and then the American species is learning about extreme  
**[0:23:45-0:23:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:23:45):**  cold hardiness because it goes all the way up into Maine where it's negative 50 Fahrenheit  
**[0:23:49-0:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:23:49):**  it can survive.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:23:50):**  And so they learn all these different things.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:23:52):**  So it's like each species has different knowledge and then within the species, individuals have  
**[0:23:57-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:23:57):**  different knowledge, there's different populations that learn different things.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:24:01):**  And so when we grow seedlings of, especially of hybrids, we're combining knowledge and  
**[0:24:08-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:24:08):**  so you can combine the cold hardiness of the American with the disease resistance of the  
**[0:24:13-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:24:13):**  Japanese and you can just find trees that are really resilient.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:24:19):**  And that's why I like, I mean, it's like the world's changing.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:24:25):**  Clones are evolutionary dead ends.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:24:27):**  Like they don't keep changing.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:24:29):**  Once you make a clone of something, it's the same and it's predictable, but the world's  
**[0:24:33-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:24:33):**  not predictable.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:24:35):**  And so you've got to have, it's gotta be flowing.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:24:39):**  Like as new generations of plants are coming on to this changing world, they have to adapt  
**[0:24:45-0:24:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:24:45):**  to the climate.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:24:46):**  So what might've been great 300 years ago might not be that great right now.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:24:52):**  We don't even have the same kind of soils anymore.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:24:54):**  Even like the atmosphere is like charged differently.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:24:57):**  And so I think if we're growing seedlings out, they're not all going to be great.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:25:03):**  They're definitely not all going to be bad.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:25:04):**  And some of them are going to be perfect for this time and place.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:25:08):**  So that's why I like seedlings.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:25:10):**  I just think they're cool.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:25:11):**  And they're, you know, clones, it's cool, but it's a little weird to think about it.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:25:17):**  I totally agree with you.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:25:18):**  It's one of the things I really connected with in your writing in your book.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:25:22):**  And with that said, can you tell our listeners how they can find your farm and the products  
**[0:25:27-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:25:27):**  that you have on offer as well as some of your writings?  
**[0:25:29-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:25:29):**  Sure.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:25:30):**  If you look up Twisted Tree Farm, you'd find us and I wrote two books.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:25:37):**  One is called Trees of Power.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:25:38):**  It's just about how to propagate trees and it highlights 10 different species that I  
**[0:25:45-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:25:45):**  think are really important.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:25:47):**  And it talks about just kind of my whole approach to growing and our role in the world.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:25:53):**  And then I wrote this other book called The Conversation, which is totally different.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:25:57):**  It's just more about life and how we're in a conversation with it.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:26:03):**  And yeah, so I haven't read that one.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:26:05):**  I really like the premise of it.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:26:06):**  I read some of the promo for it on I think it was on your website or on Chelsea Green.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:26:11):**  It sounds fascinating.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/akiva-silver-on-propagating-plants-and-starting-a-nursery-business-part-2/#t=0:26:12):**  Yeah.

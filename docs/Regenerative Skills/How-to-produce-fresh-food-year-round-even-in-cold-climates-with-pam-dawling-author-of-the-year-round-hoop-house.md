**[0:06:34-0:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:06:34):**  in farming and such and how you came to live at the Twin Oaks intentional community.

**[0:06:46-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:06:46):**  about intentional communities and organic farming.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:06:50):**  And I used to go on weekends with Woof, which over there was working weekends on organic  
**[0:06:55-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:06:55):**  farms.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:06:56):**  And so I learned a little bit, I read a lot.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:07:00):**  And then I also traveled around various communities there and joined one, helped start one.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:07:09):**  And the one I helped start was based on one in Virginia, in the US, which is Twin Oaks  
**[0:07:15-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:07:15):**  community.

**[0:07:18-0:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:07:18):**  It's a big group of people, rural intentional community that is egalitarian and secular.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:07:25):**  And I always thought, oh, that sounds like just what I'm looking for, but I thought we  
**[0:07:29-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:07:29):**  would build it in the UK.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:07:30):**  But we didn't manage to get the kind of numbers I was hoping for.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:07:35):**  And after living in several communities, I thought I would visit Twin Oaks and see if  
**[0:07:39-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:07:39):**  I really liked living with that many people and living in a different country, which was

**[0:07:48-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:07:48):**  And I've been here 28 years now.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:07:51):**  And I've still got my friends in the UK, so I can go see them from time to time.  
**[0:07:55-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:07:55):**  Oh, that's fantastic.

**[0:07:59-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:07:59):**  Yeah, kind of.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:08:00):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:08:01):**  I mean, it's a long way and I can't afford to go very often, but yeah, I've still got  
**[0:08:06-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:08:06):**  very good friends there.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:08:07):**  And that's the important bit.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:08:08):**  Yeah, definitely.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:08:09):**  So now you profile it, you know, focusing now on the book that you wrote, you profile  
**[0:08:15-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:08:15):**  quite a few different hoop house designs and we won't go over all of them because it'll  
**[0:08:19-0:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:08:19):**  take a little while.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:08:20):**  But by starting by the beginning here, which of these designs do you advocate for and why?  
**[0:08:26-0:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:08:26):**  Well, I advocate first of all, for getting the biggest hoop house you have space for  
**[0:08:32-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:08:32):**  that you can reasonably use.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:08:35):**  It's typically said when you get one hoop house, you're going to want another one.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:08:40):**  So choose a spot that is big enough for another one later or get one that's bigger than you  
**[0:08:45-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:08:45):**  think you're initially going to need.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:08:47):**  And I really advocate for the Gothic arch shape rather than the sort of half round,  
**[0:08:55-0:09:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:08:55):**  constant style because you get taller sidewalls, which makes it easier work and you've got  
**[0:09:02-0:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:09:02):**  their extra height in the roof space, which gives better air quality.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:09:09):**  And so I think that that's good.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:09:10):**  It's also much better shape for shedding snow and for coping with strong winds.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:09:17):**  So first of all, I would say go with the Gothic arch shape.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:09:21):**  Then I would say get two layers of plastic and inflate the space between them.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:09:26):**  If you can possibly get a little bit of electricity out to the site where you have your hoop house  
**[0:09:32-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:09:32):**  because the extra air gap in that space between the two layers of plastic add some thermal  
**[0:09:38-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:09:38):**  insulation at night.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:09:40):**  Otherwise you've effectively got a plastic bag between you and the outer space at night.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:09:45):**  So it's not going to keep much warmth at night in the winter if you've only got one layer,  
**[0:09:50-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:09:50):**  but two layers keeps quite a bit, sort of eight Fahrenheit degrees.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:09:53):**  I think that's kind of close to five Celsius.  
**[0:09:57-0:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:09:57):**  So two layers of plastic is good.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:09:59):**  And also the air gap and the pressure of that gives extra strength against strong winds  
**[0:10:06-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:10:06):**  and against heavy buildup of snow.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:10:09):**  So definitely two layers I would.

**[0:17:03-0:17:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:17:03):**  Well, you want somewhere relatively flat.

**[0:21:39-0:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:21:39):**  And I mean, that's probably the main motivation for putting up a hoop house in the first place.

**[0:24:48-0:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:24:48):**  So the sun pattern in the in the winter and the summer would be about the same.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:24:51):**  But is it a matter of just switching production in in a lot of places just to outdoors in

**[0:25:01-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:25:01):**  or you really just you use it primarily all throughout the year?  
**[0:25:06-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:25:06):**  We do use it all year.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:25:07):**  We kind of found that we have three seasons in there.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:25:11):**  We have the winter and early spring crops, which are mostly greens, leafy greens, but  
**[0:25:18-0:25:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:25:18):**  also radishes and turnips and salad, onions, scallions.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:25:25):**  And then we go for early tomatoes and peppers and squash and cucumbers.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:25:32):**  And we get those earlier than we could get outside.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:25:36):**  And then I mean, lots of people would keep those things all summer if they could.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:25:40):**  But we we don't.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:25:42):**  We have pests and diseases and we move on to outdoor crops of those things which do

**[0:25:49-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:25:49):**  And so what we do in summer is sometimes a legume cover crop like some kind of peas or  
**[0:25:56-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:25:56):**  beans or a seed crop of those.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:26:02):**  We have done them to harvest but to eat fresh.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:26:05):**  But we decided we didn't really want to spend the time in there harvesting when it was hot.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:26:11):**  So we we found we could do seed crops.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:26:14):**  And that was a really good use of the space in the summer because the seed, beans and  
**[0:26:19-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:26:19):**  peas have very high quality.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:26:21):**  The pods don't get the fungal diseases that they could get outside.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:26:26):**  And so they're very clean and the peas and beans are good size and we get good germination  
**[0:26:32-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:26:32):**  rates.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:26:33):**  And so we were selling seed crops out of there and that worked well.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:26:38):**  What are some of the other ones that you particularly had success with, especially when it comes  
**[0:26:42-0:26:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:26:42):**  to extending the season into the colder times?  
**[0:26:45-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:26:45):**  In the colder times we do a lot of Asian greens and kale and spinach and lettuce.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:26:53):**  Going into the winter we transplant most of those in there or direct sow them, some of  
**[0:26:57-0:27:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:26:57):**  them.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:27:00):**  So we're harvesting all our winter salads from there and also the Asian greens for cooking  
**[0:27:07-0:27:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:27:07):**  later on and the kale for cooking later on and some spinach.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:27:11):**  They grow much faster than they do outdoors.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:27:15):**  And so we're able to harvest them more often and get more from the plants.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:27:19):**  So it feels like it is very productive.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:27:21):**  Indeed.

**[0:27:25-0:27:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:27:25):**  Yeah.

**[0:27:32-0:27:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:27:32):**  and tomatoes and peppers like a month before we would dare plant them outside.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:27:37):**  Yeah.

**[0:29:25-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:29:25):**  And one of them said, what do you do about the salt buildup?  
**[0:29:28-0:29:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:29:28):**  And I just kind of looked blank.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:29:30):**  But now I know.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:29:32):**  So it happens because it doesn't rain in there.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:29:35):**  We're using drip irrigation.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:29:37):**  And the water drips into the soil and goes down deep to where the roots are to provide  
**[0:29:44-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:29:44):**  for the plants.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:29:46):**  And meanwhile, it's warm in there.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:29:48):**  So water is evaporating from the surface of the soil.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:29:52):**  And so the water is getting pulled up through the soil and evaporating.  
**[0:29:56-0:29:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:29:56):**  And that leaves the salt on the surface.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:29:59):**  I mean, if you set about, I was going to say growing your own salt, you know, getting some  
**[0:30:05-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:30:05):**  seawater and making some salt, you would evaporate off the water.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:30:09):**  And essentially that's what's happening at a slower rate in a hoop house.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:30:12):**  And so it's building up near the surface.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:30:15):**  And what we do is twice a year, we try and wash the salts deep back down into the soil  
**[0:30:22-0:30:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:30:22):**  profile again where they came from.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:30:25):**  And so we do overhead watering with a sprinkler for two hours at each spot.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:30:31):**  And then we repeat it the next day.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:30:33):**  And we're doing that, we're doing it right now actually, this time of year.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:30:38):**  And then again in early March before we've got any of those more tender crops in there.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:30:46):**  The greens are not so upset by having water on the leaves.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:30:51):**  But watering on the leaves of the tender crops is not such a good idea in our climate because  
**[0:30:55-0:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:30:55):**  of the fungal foliar diseases.  
**[0:30:58-0:30:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:30:58):**  Sure.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:30:59):**  So it really is that necessary twice a season or twice a year, I suppose, that kind of heavy  
**[0:31:05-0:31:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:31:05):**  watering and do you have sort of an apparatus that you do that with or is it a matter of  
**[0:31:10-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:31:10):**  just bringing in hoses and?  
**[0:31:12-0:31:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:31:12):**  Right, our apparatus is a lawn sprinkler.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:31:15):**  It's one of those oscillating lawn sprinkles that does a kind of rectangular shape.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:31:22):**  And that works, you know, good enough.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:31:23):**  I know another grower who would hand water all winter instead of using the drip irrigation.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:31:31):**  So they would use a hose and a wand to hand water everything all winter.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:31:36):**  But I think that takes quite a lot of time.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:31:38):**  It does, yeah.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:31:39):**  Yeah, so not in favor of that.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:31:43):**  So like you said, you've got drip irrigation running throughout the entire hoop house.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:31:47):**  Are there any other alternatives that you would recommend for different circumstances  
**[0:31:51-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:31:51):**  or is that really the way that you found works best?  
**[0:31:54-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:31:54):**  Certainly works best for us.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:31:57):**  I hadn't known very much about drip irrigation when we started out.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:32:01):**  But once you've got it set up, it's there so long as you don't punch a hole in it by  
**[0:32:05-0:32:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:32:05):**  accident and then you just fix it.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:32:09):**  So you can get a timer so you just set the water running and it turns itself off.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:32:15):**  So that's very easy.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:32:17):**  We do have to, of course, when we sow a row of something or we transplant something, we  
**[0:32:22-0:32:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:32:22):**  do have to hand water immediately so that the water goes exactly where the seeds or  
**[0:32:29-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:32:29):**  the plants are.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:32:30):**  But once they get some size to them, they can draw water from under the surface of the  
**[0:32:35-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:32:35):**  soil where the drip puts it.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:32:38):**  But some other growers do have overhead water.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:32:41):**  They have sprinklers that are suspended from the roof and they water that way.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:32:46):**  Have you found any difference, either benefit or I guess kind of a risk at wetting too much  
**[0:32:53-0:32:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:32:53):**  of the leaves?  
**[0:32:54-0:32:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:32:54):**  Like you said, in your case, there's the issue of getting fungal growth or perhaps other  
**[0:32:59-0:33:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:32:59):**  maladies.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:33:01):**  Is that the main reason why you've chosen the drip irrigation?  
**[0:33:03-0:33:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:33:03):**  It's the main reason, but it's also true that drip irrigation saves water.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:33:08):**  It uses a lot less water than sprinklers do.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:33:12):**  And you're only watering the rows where the plants are.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:33:16):**  You're not watering where the weed seeds might be.

**[0:33:22-0:33:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:33:22):**  And that's why there isn't a chapter in my book about what to do about weeds, because

**[0:34:33-0:34:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:34:33):**  And then our paths are just one foot wide, which is for people with small feet, it's

**[0:34:42-0:34:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:34:42):**  to turn their feet.

**[0:34:49-0:34:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:34:49):**  So you can have much wider paths and places that are more like have tours of people coming  
**[0:34:56-0:35:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:34:56):**  around or school groups or people with less physical mobility need wider paths than that  
**[0:35:04-0:35:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:35:04):**  for sure.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:35:05):**  But it's worked.

**[0:35:07-0:35:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:35:07):**  And we're certainly cranking out the vegetables.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:35:11):**  So we're happy with it.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:35:14):**  And what kind of fertility plan have you worked into the hoop house?  
**[0:35:18-0:35:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:35:18):**  Is it much different from your strategy outdoors?  
**[0:35:20-0:35:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:35:20):**  Do you find that there's really like it changes that much the fertility plan between those

**[0:35:28-0:35:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:35:28):**  Well, we use our homemade compost, which is very good.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:35:32):**  And we put a generous layer on in the fall when we're preparing the beds for the winter  
**[0:35:38-0:35:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:35:38):**  crops.  
**[0:35:39-0:35:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:35:39):**  And we are more generous than we are outside.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:35:43):**  And then when we come to transplanting the warm weather crops, we dig a hole and we put  
**[0:35:48-0:35:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:35:48):**  a shovel full of compost in each hole.  
**[0:35:53-0:35:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:35:53):**  That's really the main source of fertility in there, although we do try hard to sort  
**[0:35:58-0:36:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:35:58):**  of remove as less the least organic matter that we can because what with the high production  
**[0:36:05-0:36:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:36:05):**  rate of crops in there and the high temperature and the high humidity, you can really burn  
**[0:36:11-0:36:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:36:11):**  up the organic matter very fast in there.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:36:13):**  So you need to pay attention to replenishing it.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:36:17):**  So we try to leave the bits of the plants that we're not going to eat.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:36:21):**  We leave those on the surface of the soil as long as we can and hope that they're going

**[0:36:27-0:36:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:36:27):**  We've even sometimes moved them from one bed to another so they get a bit more time to  
**[0:36:31-0:36:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:36:31):**  break down.

**[0:36:38-0:36:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:36:38):**  Yeah, that makes sense.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:36:40):**  We do do soil tests.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:36:41):**  Yeah, we do soil tests once a year to see everything still in balance.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:36:47):**  So far, so good.  
**[0:36:48-0:36:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:36:48):**  And so it sounds to me like you're practicing a no dig method.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:36:52):**  Yes, right.  
**[0:36:53-0:36:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:36:53):**  Yeah, that was part of what we decided.  
**[0:36:56-0:37:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:36:56):**  We don't do no till no dig anywhere else really.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:37:00):**  But we decided we wanted to try that in the hoop house.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:37:03):**  We didn't want to bring the rototiller in.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:37:05):**  We didn't want those internal combustion engine fumes for us or our food.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:37:11):**  So we just went with manual work.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:37:15):**  And as I said, there's not much weeds, so that's not a lot of work.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:37:19):**  But we do broad fork once a year.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:37:22):**  We found that the soil does kind of settle and get a bit compacted even without stepping  
**[0:37:29-0:37:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:37:29):**  on those beds.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:37:30):**  So once a year we do broad forking, which is a big kind of U-shaped frame with big prongs  
**[0:37:37-0:37:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:37:37):**  on and you stand on the cross piece and jump up and down a bit and step off and loosen  
**[0:37:43-0:37:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:37:43):**  the soil that way.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:37:44):**  It's a bit energetic.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:37:46):**  Everyone that I've interviewed that advocates for no dig methods still swears by the broad

**[0:37:51-0:37:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:37:51):**  Yeah, yeah.

**[0:37:58-0:37:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:37:58):**  broad forks.

**[0:38:00-0:38:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:38:00):**  They're doing no till cover crops and outdoors.

**[0:38:05-0:38:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:38:05):**  Yeah, that's a very interesting system, but it doesn't fit inside our hoop house.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:38:10):**  No, I can't imagine.

**[0:38:15-0:38:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:38:15):**  Yeah, and transplanting.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:38:17):**  Yeah.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:38:18):**  Yeah.

**[0:38:23-0:38:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:38:23):**  the meat of what you go through in the book about growing things in hoop houses.

**[0:39:54-0:40:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:39:54):**  And so we left a lot to be worked out day by day without any agreed policies.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:40:00):**  And that left a lot of room for different interpretations, a bit different visions,  
**[0:40:08-0:40:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:40:08):**  like you said about your experience.  
**[0:40:11-0:40:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:40:11):**  I think we tried initially, we tried some of the structures from Twin Oaks.  
**[0:40:16-0:40:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:40:16):**  We tried the labor credit system where everybody agrees to work a certain number of hours each  
**[0:40:21-0:40:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:40:21):**  week and you write down what you did each day and add it up.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:40:25):**  And we were doing that with like five people in my community in England.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:40:29):**  We were actually, we had to work so hard, we bankrupted the labor credit system.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:40:35):**  We really, we were pioneers.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:40:37):**  We were starting a community.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:40:39):**  We needed to work ridiculously long hours.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:40:42):**  But we didn't want to say that we were going to have to work ridiculously long hours.  
**[0:40:47-0:40:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:40:47):**  So we had a work quota of how many hours a week we could do, but we had to do more.  
**[0:40:52-0:40:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:40:52):**  And in the end, we threw away the labor sheets because it wasn't working for us.  
**[0:40:57-0:41:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:40:57):**  And that led to a much looser system that later on led to me leaving.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:41:05):**  That was part of it.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:41:07):**  And so what are some of the dynamics that you found that were missing in that original  
**[0:41:12-0:41:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:41:12):**  attempt that perhaps are present or have a better example of working out where you now  
**[0:41:16-0:41:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:41:16):**  live?  
**[0:41:17-0:41:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:41:17):**  Yes, that's a hard one to answer actually.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:41:21):**  I think partly Twin Oaks, well Twin Oaks has been going now for 52 years.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:41:27):**  So there's a very established expectation of what people will do while living there  
**[0:41:32-0:41:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:41:32):**  and what they won't do.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:41:35):**  And most of it is written down in policy.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:41:37):**  So if someone starts to do something that's not what we agreed, someone can call them  
**[0:41:42-0:41:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:41:42):**  on it and we can deal with the situation.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:41:45):**  We can meet and talk with them or they can say, oh yes, I shouldn't have done that.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:41:49):**  I won't do that again.  
**[0:41:51-0:41:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:41:51):**  So that works a lot better.  
**[0:41:55-0:42:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:41:55):**  We're not trying to recreate all our policies every time a new person joins, which was part  
**[0:42:02-0:42:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:42:02):**  of the difficulty we had with a smaller community in England.  
**[0:42:05-0:42:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:42:05):**  Someone new would come in and we would give them the power to, without being fully aware  
**[0:42:10-0:42:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:42:10):**  of it, we gave them the power to ask us to sort of change all our agreements every time.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:42:15):**  So we were constantly reinventing the wheel.  
**[0:42:18-0:42:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:42:18):**  Now when someone joins Twin Oaks, they don't get that opportunity.  
**[0:42:21-0:42:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:42:21):**  You know, they're a new member.  
**[0:42:22-0:42:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:42:22):**  We've got all these people that are already living a certain way and that's the way we  
**[0:42:26-0:42:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:42:26):**  want to keep it unless a bunch of people agree with the new person, we want to make a change.  
**[0:42:33-0:42:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:42:33):**  So it's a lot more stable at Twin Oaks and that suits me because I'm really looking for  
**[0:42:39-0:42:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:42:39):**  a long term place to live.  
**[0:42:41-0:42:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:42:41):**  Yeah, yeah, I can imagine that being an important element if you're trying to build a lifestyle  
**[0:42:45-0:42:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:42:45):**  around it and as a matter of stability really has to come from within.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:42:50):**  And like you said, if it's being questioned or being kind of toppled every time a new  
**[0:42:55-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:42:55):**  person joins, that reduces that benefit for people who are trying to live a stable lifestyle.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:43:01):**  Now where do you find sort of the balance between what is expected within the communal  
**[0:43:09-0:43:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:43:09):**  structure and the amount of personal autonomy and freedom that perhaps either you wanted  
**[0:43:14-0:43:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:43:14):**  or you find that you're granted within the structure of the organization?  
**[0:43:18-0:43:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:43:18):**  Yeah, that's a good question.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:43:22):**  Well, like I said, Twin Oaks is a secular community.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-produce-fresh-food-year-round-even-in-cold-climates-with-pam-dawling-author-of-the-year-round-hoop-house/#t=0:43:25):**  It doesn't mean nobody can be religious.

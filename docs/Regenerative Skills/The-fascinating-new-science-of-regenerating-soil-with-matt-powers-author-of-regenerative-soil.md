**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:00:09):**  You're in the right place for all things regenerative living, ecological restoration,  
**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:00:14):**  permaculture and natural building.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:00:16):**  I'm your host Oliver Gaucher.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:00:18):**  In this show, it's my job to interview leaders, innovators and rebels on the cutting edge  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:00:22):**  of their fields as we look for solutions to our generation's most urgent challenges  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:00:27):**  and share these techniques and information so that you can join us in creating a healthy  
**[0:00:31-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:00:31):**  and abundant world for everyone.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:00:33):**  So let's get started.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:00:35):**  Alright, so as I mentioned in the introduction in last week's episode, this podcast is  
**[0:00:44-0:00:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:00:44):**  going to be going through a transformation next season.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:00:48):**  Starting on February the 6th, this will be called the Regenerative Skills Podcast and  
**[0:00:52-0:00:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:00:52):**  will take on a shorter format of actionable information that you can use to participate  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:00:56):**  in the regeneration of the land and the communities around you.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:01:00):**  But even though I'm excited for the changes to come, there's a lot that I'm going  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:01:03):**  to miss about this original show that has taught me so much.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:01:07):**  I've made some truly incredible connections, not only with the guests of the show through  
**[0:01:11-0:01:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:01:11):**  interviews, but through the conversations and friendships that have come from listeners  
**[0:01:15-0:01:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:01:15):**  and fans of the program like you.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:01:17):**  I'm even now working directly with friends who first reach out to me because they love  
**[0:01:21-0:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:01:21):**  the show and I've learned so much from the suggestions, insights and critiques that  
**[0:01:26-0:01:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:01:26):**  you listeners have sent in.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:01:27):**  That's why I want to give you listeners a chance to be featured on the final episode  
**[0:01:31-0:01:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:01:31):**  of the Abundant Edge Podcast on the 1st of January this new year.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:01:36):**  All you have to do to be considered is to send in a decent quality audio clip telling  
**[0:01:40-0:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:01:40):**  me about your favorite memory, favorite episode, or just something that you enjoyed about the  
**[0:01:44-0:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:01:44):**  show over the last four seasons.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:01:47):**  Tell me where you're from and where you like to listen to the show and maybe a way  
**[0:01:51-0:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:01:51):**  that you've applied something that you learned from one of the interviews.  
**[0:01:55-0:01:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:01:55):**  The final episode will be a celebration of all of you listening who've supported me  
**[0:01:58-0:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:01:58):**  and pushed me to keep improving and growing and I can't wait to hear from you directly.

**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:02:09):**  community.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:02:13):**  The Abundant Earth Foundation was formed as a way for the global permaculture movement  
**[0:02:17-0:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:02:17):**  to unite and better support one another.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:02:20):**  We fund projects around the world that are using permaculture, regenerative agriculture,  
**[0:02:24-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:02:24):**  and social entrepreneurial efforts to make a great impact at local and global levels.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:02:30):**  Our work is funded through grassroots philanthropy and we invite everyone to join and pool resources

**[0:02:56-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:02:56):**  Welcome back family and friends.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:02:58):**  Now that I've wrapped up the series on waterway regeneration, I wanted to transition into  
**[0:03:02-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:03:02):**  a two episode deep dive into an essential component of water cycle health and how it  
**[0:03:06-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:03:06):**  affects the land by analyzing the most essential component of a healthy ecology and that of  
**[0:03:12-0:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:03:12):**  course is soil.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:03:14):**  Now there have been a ton of new developments and research in this field in a very short  
**[0:03:18-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:03:18):**  time as scientists and agronomists alike are uncovering new insights into mineral cycles,  
**[0:03:23-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:03:23):**  the soil-food web, plant and mycological relationships, and so much more.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:03:28):**  Now you could sort through a small library of work to get a complete picture of all of  
**[0:03:32-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:03:32):**  these new developments or you could save time and find them all in one brilliant new book  
**[0:03:36-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:03:36):**  called Regenerative Soil by my good friend Matt Powers, the author of many well known  
**[0:03:41-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:03:41):**  volumes including the Permaculture Student Volumes 1 and 2, Unstoppable Enthusiasm,  
**[0:03:47-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:03:47):**  and now even volumes for children including the newest The Forgotten Food Forest, which  
**[0:03:52-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:03:52):**  can all be found on his website along with many online courses at the permaculturestudent.com.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:03:58):**  But of course today we'll be focusing on the cutting edge of soil science and how these  
**[0:04:02-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:04:02):**  new discoveries can help you in a very practical way to improve the health of the soil on your  
**[0:04:07-0:04:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:04:07):**  land and grow the highest quality food anywhere.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:04:11):**  In this session Matt unpacks and simplifies concepts like EH and redox scales, exclusion  
**[0:04:17-0:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:04:17):**  zone water, and soil amendments for any kind of deficiency.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:04:21):**  We also talk about how this new information has changed the way he manages his own garden  
**[0:04:26-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:04:26):**  and his advice for some of the best practices for large scale soil improvement.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:04:31):**  Now we cover a whole lot of ground in this episode so grab your notebooks and I'll hand  
**[0:04:35-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:04:35):**  things over right away to Matt.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:04:38):**  Hey Matt thanks for being with me again, it's really great to chat with you, I know there's  
**[0:04:42-0:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:04:42):**  been a lot going on and you've got a new book and so what do you say that we just jump right  
**[0:04:47-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:04:47):**  into soil science and all of the new research that you've done for your book Regenerative  
**[0:04:53-0:04:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:04:53):**  Soils?  
**[0:04:54-0:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:04:54):**  Absolutely, let's do it.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:04:56):**  Alright so tell me about the research process of writing this book because there have been  
**[0:05:02-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:05:02):**  a lot of breakthroughs in the study of soil science recently.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:05:06):**  Yeah you know what's wild is I thought I was going to do a certain threshold, a certain  
**[0:05:14-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:05:14):**  amount of research, I thought that I knew what I needed to study, that the areas that  
**[0:05:21-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:05:21):**  I needed to flesh out essentially in my understanding, but what happened was it was like the back  
**[0:05:29-0:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:05:29):**  wall of the building that was my thinking was was knocked down and it was like this  
**[0:05:35-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:05:35):**  is just a set you're on and I was blown away at how these new metrics and ways of measuring  
**[0:05:49-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:05:49):**  the world around us starting with soil but even our bodies, trees, our foods, everything  
**[0:05:57-0:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:05:57):**  it changed the way I see everything so and we always say you know soil you know relates  
**[0:06:04-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:06:04):**  to everything but it really profoundly does in so many ways that you realize and so I  
**[0:06:15-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:06:15):**  I began with you know catching up on the kind of the edge where I left off from writing  
**[0:06:22-0:06:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:06:22):**  the permaculture student too and so I'm reading books that kind of people are familiar with  
**[0:06:29-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:06:29):**  and then I kind of I was studying John Kemp which many people are familiar with for his  
**[0:06:37-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:06:37):**  regenerative ag podcast he's fabulous he's rigorous he's academic and I kind of started  
**[0:06:44-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:06:44):**  going down the academic published journal rabbit hole especially the overlap between  
**[0:06:53-0:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:06:53):**  commercial farmers and market gardeners that are finding out what parts are are not to  
**[0:07:02-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:07:02):**  be trusted not to be to be disregarded essentially and what parts are critical to understanding  
**[0:07:10-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:07:10):**  soil and it's this radical shift that is winnowing out this cold that we never knew existed that  
**[0:07:24-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:07:24):**  that is allowing us to really dynamically understand soil and revise our our ways of  
**[0:07:30-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:07:30):**  managing soil and interacting with it in a profound way so I ended up reading everything  
**[0:07:36-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:07:36):**  that nature had published on soil soil life or the rhizosphere mycorrhizal fund like I  
**[0:07:44-0:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:07:44):**  mean every angle I could possibly think of I researched and I had a subscription to nature  
**[0:07:53-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:07:53):**  so I was reading stuff that was coming out while I was reading the past 20 30 years and  
**[0:07:58-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:07:58):**  yes you know you gotta you grains of salt the further you go back in time but at the  
**[0:08:02-0:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:08:02):**  same time there are studies that aren't redone because they were so authoritative that are  
**[0:08:09-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:08:09):**  older that are critical too so I then began to contact the authors of the published literature  
**[0:08:18-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:08:18):**  the researchers and the professors from universities all over the world and I started you know  
**[0:08:27-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:08:27):**  talking to them about it and that's kind of where I am right now in the peer reviewer  
**[0:08:33-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:08:33):**  stage talking with the leading minds globally on all this stuff and it it's it's like going  
**[0:08:43-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:08:43):**  to an incredible program a school program but no structure no like you know hierarchy  
**[0:08:51-0:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:08:51):**  or someone telling me what to do or anything but it's it's it's it's like the most thrilling  
**[0:08:59-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:08:59):**  educational experience for me I mean I call my website you know the permaculturestudent.com  
**[0:09:05-0:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:09:05):**  because I am the student and I believe that all of us when we're in our best states are  
**[0:09:11-0:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:09:11):**  essentially like students where we're being observant reflective and so it's been a long  
**[0:09:21-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:09:21):**  process it took longer than I expected but it's involved reading thousands of studies  
**[0:09:28-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:09:28):**  and thousands and thousands of pages of information and developing a fluency at a level I didn't  
**[0:09:36-0:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:09:36):**  expect having to do but I'm grateful that I was put in imagine to this higher level  
**[0:09:45-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:09:45):**  well so look it seems like in our society at the moment in general people have a better  
**[0:09:50-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:09:50):**  understanding of technological processes than biological ones but in this book you've helped  
**[0:09:55-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:09:55):**  to bridge the understanding by using computers as a metaphor for soil could you break down  
**[0:10:02-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:10:02):**  how that works for listeners yeah maybe I should just start with how I thought of that  
**[0:10:06-0:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:10:06):**  originally well when we look at soil there's a there's a few dominant metaphors and and  
**[0:10:17-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:10:17):**  I didn't like any of them because it didn't take into account the biology and really the  
**[0:10:26-0:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:10:26):**  organic matter as well properly and so I was like how can I convey this in a way that everyone  
**[0:10:32-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:10:32):**  will understand especially you know people who have grown up in a world with with like  
**[0:10:39-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:10:39):**  computers and and devices and technology like you said we're technologically fluent in our  
**[0:10:45-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:10:45):**  cultures and so I just had that in mind that I had and actually this is a goal of my work  
**[0:10:53-0:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:10:53):**  it's an unstated goal but one of my metrics for success is that I have a metaphor for  
**[0:10:58-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:10:58):**  every key concept because that that's how we learn and really remember things I do believe  
**[0:11:06-0:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:11:06):**  and so when I learn that clay sand and silt are different fraction sizes and they're they're  
**[0:11:14-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:11:14):**  you know they're like drastically different like sands gigantic you know but they're different  
**[0:11:20-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:11:20):**  fraction sizes of silicates and and like sand you know silicon and oxygen those are the  
**[0:11:29-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:11:29):**  two most abundant elements in the crust of the earth so so it's really fascinating when  
**[0:11:35-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:11:35):**  we think about these things on an elemental level when we actually engage in the chemistry  
**[0:11:41-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:11:41):**  through the biochemistry through the biological functioning that we see this amazing amazing  
**[0:11:50-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:11:50):**  series of events and changes that are critical to all life happening so if we think about  
**[0:11:58-0:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:11:58):**  it these silicates are just like the silicon chips the you know the microprocessor chips  
**[0:12:06-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:12:06):**  inside inside all the machines that we're all using that we've grown up using and essentially  
**[0:12:13-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:12:13):**  they're the hardware but as we some of us remember the apple two e's you know in the  
**[0:12:20-0:12:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:12:20):**  80s you needed a an operation system an os to actually work it so usually that came in  
**[0:12:28-0:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:12:28):**  like a floppy disk you know and you'd put this little floppy disk in and you'd be able  
**[0:12:32-0:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:12:32):**  to boot up and the reality is soil's kind of like that and it's the organic matter that  
**[0:12:40-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:12:40):**  is the program and you can put different types of organic matter in and get different kinds  
**[0:12:44-0:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:12:44):**  of operations operating systems you put in really bacterial dominant really alkaline  
**[0:12:51-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:12:51):**  stuff and you're going to get an oxidized alkaline reaction or a predilection towards  
**[0:12:56-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:12:56):**  reaction in the soil and so it's the programming that we put in and it's also amazingly the  
**[0:13:04-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:13:04):**  battery so in the soil organic matter is a reservoir for the protons and electrons that  
**[0:13:12-0:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:13:12):**  are being reduced which you know in chemistry terms reduction is the addition of of electrons  
**[0:13:19-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:13:19):**  which you know are negative are yeah well protons are positive but but this reduction  
**[0:13:28-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:13:28):**  is coming down through the plants and it's adding energy into the soil and it's being  
**[0:13:33-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:13:33):**  stored in the organic matter and we can we can see this happening in our own gardens  
**[0:13:42-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:13:42):**  and those of us who have worked with really healthy plants see this soil response and  
**[0:13:48-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:13:48):**  it's absolutely amazing and it's because when we have it so organic matter the plants can  
**[0:13:55-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:13:55):**  actually finish photosynthesis properly and so people say you know soil organic matter  
**[0:14:02-0:14:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:14:02):**  is the housing for life and that's true but it's also the operating system for the users  
**[0:14:08-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:14:08):**  of this this metaphor the the soil organic matter is the housing but so is the biochar  
**[0:14:17-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:14:17):**  that you could add which is more like hardware to this system but the fungi bacteria nematodes  
**[0:14:24-0:14:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:14:24):**  protozoan you know all these different microbes and their groups that we're talking about  
**[0:14:30-0:14:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:14:30):**  because they're we can get down to the individual level and talk about them individually because  
**[0:14:36-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:14:36):**  they they do have amazing characteristics when you do that but just in general all these  
**[0:14:44-0:14:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:14:44):**  these groups of microbes and and small soil animals are the actual chemists and because  
**[0:14:54-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:14:54):**  I was able to make the biochemistry connections showing the flow of energy showing the flow  
**[0:15:01-0:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:15:01):**  of cycles between all the different minerals we actually can see now how the biology is  
**[0:15:10-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:15:10):**  the the primary driver in pH and eh in our soil and they are the the drivers of the soil  
**[0:15:20-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:15:20):**  so they're the ones that are going to be doing the chemistry for us we we've tried to do  
**[0:15:26-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:15:26):**  the chemistry we thought we were the users of soil but we're so am fisted at it that  
**[0:15:33-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:15:33):**  we've destroyed the soil with chemical ag and it's on the backs of generations of tillage  
**[0:15:40-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:15:40):**  which also destroys soil but but it's really critical to understand that because it's just  
**[0:15:49-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:15:49):**  like our computer like a 90s pc we can take off the lid we can go in there and we can  
**[0:15:57-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:15:57):**  add rock dust or biochar to our hardware increasing the cec capacity the cation exchange  
**[0:16:05-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:16:05):**  capacity but also increasing the paramagnetism and that holds incredible amounts of energy  
**[0:16:13-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:16:13):**  and water in the soil when we do that and then we can add soil organic matter using  
**[0:16:20-0:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:16:20):**  our compost heap or just using plants because plants healthy plants actually bring in more  
**[0:16:28-0:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:16:28):**  soil organic matter in forms that that participate quicker in humification then or then compost  
**[0:16:37-0:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:16:37):**  does and compost is energy intensive while and expands energy while plants absorb energy  
**[0:16:45-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:16:45):**  from the sun turn it into these sugars and these protons that they're releasing along  
**[0:16:52-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:16:52):**  their roots and it's it's an overall net gain in energy in a system if you're measuring  
**[0:16:59-0:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:16:59):**  all the different aspects of the ecology of your farm so that's that's what i arrived  
**[0:17:06-0:17:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:17:06):**  upon um it really helps if you look at the image with it all so much of what i'm doing  
**[0:17:14-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:17:14):**  in this book is reducing things down to an image that's true so that we can or a metaphor  
**[0:17:20-0:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:17:20):**  that's true and so that we can hold on to these things and develop a fluency because  
**[0:17:26-0:17:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:17:26):**  boy i mean i talk about you know soil biology over here but we only know one percent of  
**[0:17:33-0:17:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:17:33):**  the soil microbes and so it's we got to be humble we got to be careful and we got to  
**[0:17:40-0:17:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:17:40):**  be just real honest about what we know and don't know and how we can interact with it  
**[0:17:45-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:17:45):**  and it's been it's been that process in the research that's for sure sure sure yeah and  
**[0:17:52-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:17:52):**  it gives a good framework to kind of make the connection for things that people are  
**[0:17:55-0:18:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:17:55):**  unfamiliar with by giving that metaphor for things that we kind of interact with and understand  
**[0:18:00-0:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:18:00):**  a bit more on a daily basis now before reading this book i personally was fairly familiar  
**[0:18:06-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:18:06):**  with the ph scale and how it applies to soil but one thing that i had no idea about with  
**[0:18:12-0:18:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:18:12):**  the the breakthrough around e h and the concept of redox i think i'm pronouncing that properly  
**[0:18:19-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:18:19):**  and though this deals with some pretty complex chemistry which you explain really well in  
**[0:18:24-0:18:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:18:24):**  the book can you give us a simplified way of understanding e h through maybe some methods  
**[0:18:31-0:18:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:18:31):**  that people can relate to like the last ones absolutely the cool thing and the kind of  
**[0:18:37-0:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:18:37):**  all right so this is the deal give me the deal matt in science we create vocabularies  
**[0:18:43-0:18:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:18:43):**  that create these silos there's these silos created in the scientific language that really  
**[0:18:50-0:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:18:50):**  make things confusing a lot and chemistry is the worst when it comes to a lot of this  
**[0:18:55-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:18:55):**  language but when we look at ph it's the power of hydrogen and i want us to think about hydrogen  
**[0:19:04-0:19:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:19:04):**  today right now in terms of water okay so we're looking at ph and we're looking at water  
**[0:19:12-0:19:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:19:12):**  and you're like man that h that's in water and it's double in water than air okay and  
**[0:19:19-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:19:19):**  so if we have a organic matter rich pd mock of of soil in a swamp and that's going to  
**[0:19:30-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:19:30):**  be acidic that's going to be low in low ph which means it means it gets a lot of lot  
**[0:19:36-0:19:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:19:36):**  of h and i know it's confusing because up is down it feels like usually i understand  
**[0:19:43-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:19:43):**  that one through my nose i can smell it that that is so cool and i agree with that i resonate  
**[0:19:49-0:19:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:19:49):**  with the fact that you develop this smell taste feel look to things as you start delving  
**[0:19:58-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:19:58):**  into this idea of ph and eh because they're connected and they're connected because that  
**[0:20:05-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:20:05):**  h2o now oxidized soils sandy soils dried soils they're going to be more oxidized and alkaline  
**[0:20:17-0:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:20:17):**  that means they're going to be high on the redox scale high on the eh which is um the  
**[0:20:27-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:20:27):**  how oxidized things are and what's really kind of interesting fascinating and maybe  
**[0:20:33-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:20:33):**  to us in chemistry class would have been frustrating but here it makes sense electron gaining is  
**[0:20:39-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:20:39):**  the opposite of oxidation to gain an oxygen is to gain an oxygen as an element in a relationship  
**[0:20:47-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:20:47):**  in the soil is to lose electrons and this is true of all chemistry but so when we oxidize  
**[0:20:55-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:20:55):**  our soils when we aerate our soils we are losing energy from our soils we are also oxidizing  
**[0:21:03-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:21:03):**  minerals which makes most of the minerals insoluble to plant and if we go too far into  
**[0:21:13-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:21:13):**  h2o then it gets too acidic right we water log it and then it gets anaerobic and there's  
**[0:21:21-0:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:21:21):**  not enough oxygen and what happens here is all those heavy metals become suddenly soluble  
**[0:21:31-0:21:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:21:31):**  so when we look at this these two scales these interrelated scales we actually can put them  
**[0:21:38-0:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:21:38):**  together and make an x and y axis and we can make a picture of a corrosion chart is what  
**[0:21:46-0:21:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:21:46):**  it's called of what is actually happening at a certain temperature and certain concentrations  
**[0:21:53-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:21:53):**  because things change when you change the temperature for each element so we suddenly  
**[0:22:01-0:22:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:22:01):**  go oh wow when it's really acidic this is the form of aluminum that's present but oh  
**[0:22:08-0:22:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:22:08):**  when it gets you know up to 5.5 it goes into an insoluble form except at this level of  
**[0:22:16-0:22:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:22:16):**  oxidation except at this like you can actually see it it's really incredible to use these  
**[0:22:25-0:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:22:25):**  new tools to diagnose but to go greater like you said into a fluency you begin to see those  
**[0:22:32-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:22:32):**  sandy soils and go oh man any night any form of nitrogen that goes on there in a couple  
**[0:22:38-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:22:38):**  hours it's going to be nitrate you're going to need to water four times as much on this  
**[0:22:42-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:22:42):**  soil to even allow this plant to take up that nitrate and turn it into ammonium internally  
**[0:22:49-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:22:49):**  which is going to alkaline make the plant more alkaline in the process so you suddenly  
**[0:22:57-0:23:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:22:57):**  start seeing all these domino effects of these things you start to be able to observe without  
**[0:23:05-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:23:05):**  any measurements once you start getting fluent in this stuff you see it you see the stresses  
**[0:23:11-0:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:23:11):**  and go oh I have a fungal blight I have a calcium boron or silicon deficiency you suddenly  
**[0:23:24-0:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:23:24):**  see what needs to happen you're like oh I need to you know lower the the eh of the soil  
**[0:23:31-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:23:31):**  I'm going to put on some em and lower at 30 millivolts into few hours and you begin to  
**[0:23:39-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:23:39):**  see what needs to be done how to do it and you don't need the measurements because you  
**[0:23:44-0:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:23:44):**  can smell it you can see it you can feel it so I would say that the testing is really  
**[0:23:50-0:23:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:23:50):**  critical to do as an experience and as a vital check because in the midwest there's soils  
**[0:23:59-0:24:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:23:59):**  that don't have selenium you might be in a sandy soil area with very little of much of  
**[0:24:04-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:24:04):**  anything and you're building from scratch and and you might have toxicities that are  
**[0:24:11-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:24:11):**  critical to address and are very addressable as I talk about in the book I mean it's really  
**[0:24:17-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:24:17):**  incredibly hopeful what we can do in the face of some of these crazy things that can be  
**[0:24:23-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:24:23):**  in our soils yeah that's what I got from it too there's a lot of hope around these ideas  
**[0:24:29-0:24:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:24:29):**  that seem super complex based on you know difficult science and I guess I guess advanced  
**[0:24:37-0:24:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:24:37):**  examinations and testing measures but you always find a way to bring it back to what  
**[0:24:42-0:24:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:24:42):**  people can do without those as well and while those are certainly useful they can tell you  
**[0:24:47-0:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:24:47):**  a lot of things that your basic senses can't or just regular observation can't go down  
**[0:24:52-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:24:52):**  to that level of specificity there are solutions for all this stuff that are approachable for  
**[0:24:57-0:25:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:24:57):**  just about everybody so in practical terms what does it mean for soil health when we  
**[0:25:02-0:25:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:25:02):**  talk about being out of an ideal range for e h or p h because like most things in nature  
**[0:25:10-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:25:10):**  it seems to revolve around a healthy medium sort of a sweet spot of balance between the  
**[0:25:15-0:25:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:25:15):**  extremes of where it can range to great question so while we look at the soil and we look through  
**[0:25:23-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:25:23):**  p h only we miss we miss this range along which a lot of the viruses and pests are traveling  
**[0:25:36-0:25:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:25:36):**  and so while you're like I'm in the ideal p h what's going on and your plants are just  
**[0:25:42-0:25:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:25:42):**  being eaten you might be in the wrong e h and that is exactly what's happening you might  
**[0:25:49-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:25:49):**  have a deficiency or toxicity or just an element that's a little too high can actually antagonize  
**[0:25:56-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:25:56):**  another and make it unavailable so I think it's incredibly useful to develop an understanding  
**[0:26:05-0:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:26:05):**  so you've developed the eye for this and I think the other thing to just get back to  
**[0:26:12-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:26:12):**  what you were saying is about distinctions what one way to define intelligence is to  
**[0:26:18-0:26:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:26:18):**  define it as the ability to notice or iterate distinctions and the number of distinctions  
**[0:26:27-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:26:27):**  you are aware of denotes your how well you understand that thing we're discussing and  
**[0:26:34-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:26:34):**  what happens when you kind of raw get introduced to this science in a way that's digestible  
**[0:26:42-0:26:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:26:42):**  like color-coded charts that are directly related to like high e h and high p h those  
**[0:26:50-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:26:50):**  are sandy alkaline soils that are oxidized that are dry but reduced acidic soils those  
**[0:26:59-0:27:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:26:59):**  are the peat mosses those are the bogs and in between those is is the ideal but monitoring  
**[0:27:11-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:27:11):**  the e h and understanding that we we really need to allow for plant roots and soil microbiology  
**[0:27:23-0:27:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:27:23):**  to control these things because in the no-till situation they draw it right to hover around  
**[0:27:30-0:27:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:27:30):**  neutral in the soil while in the roots on they're down to three to four p h so we really  
**[0:27:39-0:27:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:27:39):**  need to let them do their work and their thing and this will all play out really really well  
**[0:27:45-0:27:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:27:45):**  and while we diagnose these things using these charts and we learn to see them like you can  
**[0:27:53-0:27:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:27:53):**  see that the top right of the e h p h chart is not where you want to be locks up all the  
**[0:27:58-0:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:27:58):**  nutrients and creates some toxicities but it's mostly deficiency and you don't want  
**[0:28:04-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:28:04):**  to be in the bottom left where it's acidic and overly reduced because that's where heavy  
**[0:28:10-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:28:10):**  metals toxicity comes in and of course the the pests viruses umocytes bacterial and and  
**[0:28:22-0:28:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:28:22):**  fungal pathogens they are all hovering around just off the path in the ideal zone so it's  
**[0:28:32-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:28:32):**  it's it's really helpful when you look at the picture and and it's on it's actually  
**[0:28:39-0:28:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:28:39):**  if you go look at the pre-order website while you're listening to us speak you can scan  
**[0:28:44-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:28:44):**  through and see all these things that i'm talking about you can see diagrams and i think  
**[0:28:49-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:28:49):**  that's what's really critical too about all this stuff i'm talking about is it is new  
**[0:28:56-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:28:56):**  and it requires us to do some mental work to grasp i feel and the the images make it  
**[0:29:05-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:29:05):**  so it readily happens and so i would i would just highly recommend that folks um maybe  
**[0:29:11-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:29:11):**  even pause this and pop over there and have it in front of you as i'm saying this because  
**[0:29:16-0:29:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:29:16):**  that chart you know it's like we're dodging all these different danger zones um to get  
**[0:29:22-0:29:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:29:22):**  to that sweet spot but we can do it um and what's incredible is that when we reach that  
**[0:29:29-0:29:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:29:29):**  sweet spot and things are really humming it actually removes the soluble minerals and  
**[0:29:37-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:29:37):**  nutrients from the salt solution of the soil for the most part because it's all in the  
**[0:29:43-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:29:43):**  economy the fungi and bacteria are scuttling it around and handing off and everything's  
**[0:29:48-0:29:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:29:48):**  efficient so it means that our tests would show that we had very little of good things  
**[0:29:56-0:30:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:29:56):**  in our so we've showed that we were low in everything which fascinated me because if  
**[0:30:01-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:30:01):**  we apply that to so many of the things that we're worried about currently if the cycling  
**[0:30:06-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:30:06):**  of carbon increases in its capacity and pace will outpace our release and will start having  
**[0:30:15-0:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:30:15):**  drawdown happen in an aggressive and new kind of like a z-axis on the chart here you know  
**[0:30:24-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:30:24):**  opening up new possibilities man yeah this concept is really interesting to me and i  
**[0:30:29-0:30:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:30:29):**  look forward to finding new ways to apply it when i actually go out on sites now i want  
**[0:30:33-0:30:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:30:33):**  to introduce one of the other concepts that you explore in the book that i had not heard  
**[0:30:37-0:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:30:37):**  anything about before uh reading your volume and that's that of exclusion zone or ez water  
**[0:30:44-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:30:44):**  and that's easy not simple but easy the letters can you explain what that is and how it occurs  
**[0:30:51-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:30:51):**  and what it means for the soil just kind of give me an overview for our listeners have  
**[0:30:55-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:30:55):**  you ever seen a water droplet land and then tiny little water droplets skitter on top  
**[0:31:03-0:31:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:31:03):**  of the water i mean i haven't personally i've seen it on video but you got to get in pretty  
**[0:31:08-0:31:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:31:08):**  close to see that yeah um have have you ever well so you've seen you've probably seen water  
**[0:31:19-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:31:19):**  do weird things on windows too um when you watch the rain because you you're old enough  
**[0:31:26-0:31:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:31:26):**  to not have constant entertainment in your childhood um there's there's physics going  
**[0:31:33-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:31:33):**  on and there's attraction among water droplets and there's something going on there that  
**[0:31:40-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:31:40):**  many of us can easily observe and understand and when water skitters on top of water when  
**[0:31:51-0:31:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:31:51):**  you know those special reptiles that run across water they talk about the tension the surface  
**[0:31:58-0:32:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:31:58):**  tension of the water now we we we kind of have this problem in science where we don't  
**[0:32:06-0:32:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:32:06):**  closely look at things that are everywhere the the weeds that were once native american  
**[0:32:13-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:32:13):**  foods are very rarely tested for nutritional quality or value we tend to look past these  
**[0:32:20-0:32:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:32:20):**  things that are obvious but what's going on there is is magnetic right there's like an  
**[0:32:28-0:32:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:32:28):**  ionic magnetic force thing going on there that we all can observe um this skittering  
**[0:32:37-0:32:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:32:37):**  of a droplet on top of other of the other water and that's because there is a structural  
**[0:32:45-0:32:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:32:45):**  difference in the water and yes there is other things going on the air is obviously um because  
**[0:32:55-0:32:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:32:55):**  we talk about grounding all the time now it's been medically proven to help people right  
**[0:32:59-0:33:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:32:59):**  we get those you know negative ions right we're grounding ourselves well the sky you  
**[0:33:05-0:33:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:33:05):**  know the air partly charged so that water is coming down and there's a there's a charge  
**[0:33:11-0:33:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:33:11):**  difference right so there's something going on here and as we looked closer into well  
**[0:33:18-0:33:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:33:18):**  i should say gerald pollack looked closer into this he put a tube a little straw tube  
**[0:33:26-0:33:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:33:26):**  into a vat of water and what he witnessed was that it started to move the water and  
**[0:33:37-0:33:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:33:37):**  it was a hydrophilic tube meaning it loves water right so um the nature like almost everything  
**[0:33:45-0:33:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:33:45):**  that's hydrophilic uh it loves water and so what happens especially in sunlight think  
**[0:33:53-0:34:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:33:53):**  about this the water polarizes on surfaces and so this polarity that forms changes the  
**[0:34:05-0:34:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:34:05):**  structure of water from h2o into h3o2 and it forms a lattice a crystalline structure  
**[0:34:16-0:34:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:34:16):**  and we're familiar with this if you've studied colloids or gels at all um some of those crystalline  
**[0:34:22-0:34:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:34:22):**  structures are formed some of them are not formed and orderly but this is an orderly  
**[0:34:30-0:34:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:34:30):**  i think a package just arrived my dogs like to wanna um but it forms this orderly lattice  
**[0:34:38-0:34:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:34:38):**  work and it does something very peculiar it actually can conduct electrons and protons  
**[0:34:48-0:34:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:34:48):**  and so it's a semiconductor and a superconductor so it can conduct these things but it also  
**[0:34:54-0:35:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:34:54):**  can do it instantaneously and so it's like this added barrier onto soil roots and then  
**[0:35:06-0:35:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:35:06):**  it changed it changes like the way we've used soil because the more easy water you can form  
**[0:35:15-0:35:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:35:15):**  the more holding capacity your soil has right because it's forming this lattice work of  
**[0:35:20-0:35:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:35:20):**  gel so this happens on the surface to a degree just because the sunlight's there there's  
**[0:35:26-0:35:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:35:26):**  particles it's happening on roots because they're hydrophilic and they're helping roots  
**[0:35:32-0:35:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:35:32):**  conduct out these protons out into the soil and it's it's incredible because of a few  
**[0:35:43-0:35:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:35:43):**  different things this is what explains how trees using their transpiration their the  
**[0:35:51-0:36:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:35:51):**  water transport in their in their um the plant body to in less than you know four seconds  
**[0:36:00-0:36:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:36:00):**  conduct uh an element or a molecule from the root tip to a plant-like leaf and it's and  
**[0:36:11-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:36:11):**  it's it's like a mag and this is john kemp's metaphor i should give him credit from our  
**[0:36:16-0:36:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:36:16):**  last conversation but it's like a maglev train upward an elevator and so zooming soup and  
**[0:36:23-0:36:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:36:23):**  we've all played with magnets and felt that that that that feeling of just it just can  
**[0:36:30-0:36:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:36:30):**  go there's no friction it just soon effortless that's what's happening and because that's  
**[0:36:38-0:36:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:36:38):**  how fast these things can travel through these pathways when we have soil life that's robust  
**[0:36:46-0:36:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:36:46):**  we have the water to do the things that they can do it's no surprise that we're conducting  
**[0:36:55-0:37:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:36:55):**  and i say conduct because that's how these things are it's bioelectric they're conducting  
**[0:37:01-0:37:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:37:01):**  you know minerals and and and elements and nutrients all over the place very quickly  
**[0:37:09-0:37:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:37:09):**  cross fields between between plants because i mean yeah i won't get too far into that  
**[0:37:15-0:37:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:37:15):**  but but um like brady rhizobia can share the nitrogen it's fixing um other rhizobia uh  
**[0:37:22-0:37:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:37:22):**  that that has been documented so far it cannot and so these things are happening in real  
**[0:37:27-0:37:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:37:27):**  time um they're happening so fast that we we definitely probably can't track them unless  
**[0:37:34-0:37:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:37:34):**  we're doing like this test where we put a radioactive uh isotope into a plant root area  
**[0:37:41-0:37:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:37:41):**  and they suck it up and we track you know where it went uh because it is happening so  
**[0:37:46-0:37:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:37:46):**  ridiculously fast and it's so complicated and powerful when you look at it on a you  
**[0:37:55-0:38:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:37:55):**  know a uh nanometer or nanometer um kind of process that that uh it can be humbling but  
**[0:38:06-0:38:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:38:06):**  that's what's going on is you have the ability to step into the complexity but to recognize  
**[0:38:12-0:38:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:38:12):**  it in a way that's functionally pragmatic you can see how these things work they're  
**[0:38:19-0:38:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:38:19):**  knowable um and i i i this is such this is a tangent but it's connected the author of  
**[0:38:27-0:38:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:38:27):**  born on a blue day daniel tammet i believe his name is he he can recite pie you know  
**[0:38:33-0:38:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:38:33):**  he's internalized this incredible mathematical thing and yeah he's on the spectrum of autism  
**[0:38:41-0:38:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:38:41):**  but that's you know and being able to internalize these great things and then instinctually  
**[0:38:46-0:38:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:38:46):**  understand them at such a great depth means that all of us have this capacity to make  
**[0:38:52-0:39:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:38:52):**  science and math and even data into these pragmatic easy to understand actionable observations  
**[0:39:05-0:39:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:39:05):**  and so um i i really really value this experience that i've had personally because i see the  
**[0:39:14-0:39:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:39:14):**  world completely different i i'm i i'm excited to talk to dr zach bush about uh about what's  
**[0:39:22-0:39:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:39:22):**  going on in my gut um from an eh perspective now from a redox perspective because i know  
**[0:39:29-0:39:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:39:29):**  that's what he figured out and that's what his breakthrough is is that he is moving in  
**[0:39:35-0:39:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:39:35):**  a new modality and he's changing the charge on the actual membranes of the human cell  
**[0:39:42-0:39:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:39:42):**  which literally is what we're talking about here so i am i am extremely excited not just  
**[0:39:51-0:39:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:39:51):**  for for soil but for me personally because this is a breakthrough that it's going to  
**[0:39:58-0:40:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:39:58):**  interconnect our bodies to the soil in a way that is going to never going to part it we're  
**[0:40:05-0:40:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:40:05):**  never in the future we're never going to be able to separate our human health from the  
**[0:40:11-0:40:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:40:11):**  soil from the research that is being done right now and the book leads you to that in  
**[0:40:17-0:40:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:40:17):**  a way that doesn't like point it out in a way that allows you to just understand the  
**[0:40:23-0:40:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:40:23):**  data and go wait but doesn't this mean that uh and i think that's the best well because  
**[0:40:32-0:40:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:40:32):**  when it comes down to we're all made of the same stuff and when we're dealing with things  
**[0:40:37-0:40:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:40:37):**  on a chemical and a physics sort of analytical way of breaking down the elements the building  
**[0:40:44-0:40:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:40:44):**  blocks that make up all life there are crossovers among things that support the natural function  
**[0:40:52-0:41:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:40:52):**  of protozoa as do the cells in a human body and by being able to understand how they transfer  
**[0:41:01-0:41:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:41:01):**  energy and move nutrients and permeate cell walls like you've explored in this book obviously  
**[0:41:08-0:41:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:41:08):**  this is through a lens of the health and applications of rebuilding and regenerating soils but this  
**[0:41:14-0:41:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:41:14):**  is applicable to all forms of life as well yeah i immediately understood why i was always  
**[0:41:21-0:41:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:41:21):**  felt healed by sauerkraut because it's a fermentation there's no oxygen and it's extraordinarily  
**[0:41:30-0:41:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:41:30):**  reduced so it's high in electrons so me taking it in gives me cellular energy which allows  
**[0:41:38-0:41:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:41:38):**  me to be more efficient at digesting my food which is crazy cool there's one thing that  
**[0:41:47-0:41:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:41:47):**  you and i was connected on because we've both kind of suffered from digestive problems and  
**[0:41:52-0:41:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:41:52):**  come to a lot of similar conclusions about the you know the treatment of the gut biome  
**[0:41:58-0:42:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:41:58):**  and figuring out dietary ways to rejuvenate our energy and fix the digestive process and  
**[0:42:05-0:42:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:42:05):**  being able to see it through a lens like this through the exchange of electrons like you're  
**[0:42:11-0:42:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:42:11):**  mentioning is a is a really cool analogy for it yeah i i and again i'm not a doctor but  
**[0:42:19-0:42:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:42:19):**  i'm excited to kind of ask some just incredible questions that i now have to someone who who  
**[0:42:27-0:42:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:42:27):**  is studying this and i feel like that's what truth does it opens up so many more questions  
**[0:42:34-0:42:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:42:34):**  well so along those lines like we've got into some pretty heady new discoveries in biology  
**[0:42:40-0:42:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:42:40):**  and in soil but at the same time the book has a long list of actions that people can  
**[0:42:45-0:42:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:42:45):**  take to amend their soil depending on whatever challenges they face whether they want to  
**[0:42:50-0:42:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:42:50):**  dive deep into the academic learning of it or just want to work on the practical side  
**[0:42:55-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:42:55):**  so are there any soil treatments that kind of apply broadly to just about any deficiency  
**[0:43:01-0:43:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:43:01):**  condition or is the key really figuring out the context of what you're dealing with and  
**[0:43:06-0:43:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:43:06):**  the appropriate amendments for for that context yeah that's a great question i would say that  
**[0:43:14-0:43:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:43:14):**  the common answer three years ago would have been uh compost but i don't think that's such  
**[0:43:21-0:43:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:43:21):**  an easy answer any longer um i would say healthy photosynthesizing and fully photosynthesizing  
**[0:43:30-0:43:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:43:30):**  plants are going to change soil and if you get the proper ones ones that are like biotillage  
**[0:43:38-0:43:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:43:38):**  right bio fertilizer then you're going to change your soil faster and so i and and caveat  
**[0:43:49-0:43:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:43:49):**  right i i'm constantly using effective microbes em um that i brew here at home and i have  
**[0:43:58-0:44:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:43:58):**  some that i've gotten from tereganics and i love them i've gotten some from k  
**[0:44:18-0:44:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:44:18):**  towns behind me right now in big barrels and that reduces our soil i'm in an oxidized area  
**[0:44:26-0:44:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:44:26):**  i'm in a you know a heavy clay area and so i go from santa clay you know and so by bringing  
**[0:44:38-0:44:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:44:38):**  in consistent em i'm kind of reminding the the eh ph to head back towards um ph is 6.5  
**[0:44:49-0:44:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:44:49):**  to 7 in the ideal zone of eh as well which is 400 to 450 millivolts and so i'm constantly  
**[0:44:56-0:45:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:44:56):**  kind of like knocking on that door being like up get back down there you know and so it's  
**[0:45:03-0:45:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:45:03):**  really an incredibly useful amendment that we can create at home on our own we can add  
**[0:45:13-0:45:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:45:13):**  to the consortium the consortium's an excellent consortium um but i add rhizophageus interdices  
**[0:45:20-0:45:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:45:20):**  as a spurllium um i i add uh i i add other things in order to just have more microbes  
**[0:45:31-0:45:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:45:31):**  that i mean i i like bringing in phosphorus solubilizers i like bringing in um free living  
**[0:45:39-0:45:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:45:39):**  nitrogen uh fixers i like bringing endophytic nitrogen fixers i like i like bringing in  
**[0:45:46-0:45:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:45:46):**  a lot of different things so em is kind of the basis with which i add all those things  
**[0:45:52-0:45:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:45:52):**  in it it's going to turn any nitrogenous soluble matter that i bring into the equation into  
**[0:45:57-0:46:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:45:57):**  an amino acid if i leave it alone for three days and that way i don't shock my plants  
**[0:46:02-0:46:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:46:02):**  and say here convert this nitrogen instead i give them amino acids and it gives them  
**[0:46:06-0:46:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:46:06):**  an immediate boost of energy um just by giving them amino acids uh and there's you know there's  
**[0:46:12-0:46:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:46:12):**  always amino acids as plant metabolite right but this is specific by giving them night  
**[0:46:17-0:46:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:46:17):**  extra nitrogen causing this but then at the same time i'm also adding all this energy  
**[0:46:22-0:46:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:46:22):**  in and then i'm adding purple non-sulfur bacteria which is one of the consortium members of  
**[0:46:26-0:46:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:46:26):**  em and i mean they're they're just going to be giving literally giving out energy because  
**[0:46:32-0:46:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:46:32):**  they're photosynthesizers so uh and then you have um uh saccharomyces um cerveza which  
**[0:46:42-0:46:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:46:42):**  is uh i always butcher pronunciation so forgive me on all that but um it's baker's because  
**[0:46:48-0:46:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:46:48):**  you did just say beer and right right here yeah it's baker's yeast or brewer's yeast  
**[0:46:54-0:46:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:46:54):**  beer yeast right um but the the wild thing is that's actually a plant growth promoting  
**[0:46:59-0:47:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:46:59):**  um uh microbe so and it's endophytic so this entire time um we're adding this to these  
**[0:47:09-0:47:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:47:09):**  drinks when in fact it's if we have healthy soils and we're participating in in just regenerative  
**[0:47:18-0:47:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:47:18):**  soil practices it's already in the soil it'll already be in your plants so this is how in  
**[0:47:23-0:47:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:47:23):**  in days of yore you know they would just stomp the grapes and then they'd have wine because  
**[0:47:29-0:47:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:47:29):**  there was endophytic microbes doing all that for them um so so i really value em as kind  
**[0:47:36-0:47:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:47:36):**  of the mother culture of all my cultures i i i i just find it really incredible and then  
**[0:47:45-0:47:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:47:45):**  i would say biochar and rock dust they're not really techniques or methods unless you're  
**[0:47:52-0:47:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:47:52):**  making your own biochar which is you know you can do conservation burn on your own and  
**[0:47:57-0:48:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:47:57):**  it's actually surprisingly efficient for an open burn and you can completely change your  
**[0:48:04-0:48:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:48:04):**  soil so i would say that em healthy plants and that means like you know foliar feeding  
**[0:48:12-0:48:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:48:12):**  with kelp and em regularly for me and from what i've seen in the research and then increasing  
**[0:48:20-0:48:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:48:20):**  the hardware of the soil so that means we're gonna be we're gonna be adding rock dusts  
**[0:48:26-0:48:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:48:26):**  which increases the paramagnetism and brings in a lot of surface area to your soil because  
**[0:48:34-0:48:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:48:34):**  it's so fine which which again you know that surface area is incredibly powerful this is  
**[0:48:40-0:48:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:48:40):**  why clay has that cec capacity because it's fine in comparison to the sand which is this  
**[0:48:46-0:48:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:48:46):**  giant block essentially so i would say that's the thing to do i mean so of all these methods  
**[0:48:53-0:48:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:48:53):**  that you've talked about and certainly you've outlined a ton in the book everything from  
**[0:48:57-0:49:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:48:57):**  hugel culture to recipes for the ems that you just talked about which ones do you think  
**[0:49:02-0:49:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:49:02):**  apply on the broadest scale because a lot of these are kind of not just time intensive  
**[0:49:08-0:49:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:49:08):**  or potentially machine intensive or ingredient intensive as far as bringing imports from  
**[0:49:14-0:49:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:49:14):**  elsewhere onto your land in order to rejuvenate the soil but like do you think it's it's mostly  
**[0:49:23-0:49:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:49:23):**  up to the plants things like cover crops getting the proper plant life into the soil that are  
**[0:49:30-0:49:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:49:30):**  the most cost effective ways to regenerate soils on a really broad scale or do you still  
**[0:49:36-0:49:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:49:36):**  think that certain types of amendments and imports are going to be the most effective  
**[0:49:42-0:49:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:49:42):**  yeah that's a great question so while we would love for rock dust to be everywhere it's not  
**[0:49:50-0:49:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:49:50):**  but if you can grow it and turn it into biochar you can start changing your hardware and if  
**[0:49:59-0:50:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:49:59):**  you can do long-term compost this is the breakthrough that most people weren't expecting but maybe  
**[0:50:10-0:50:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:50:10):**  we should have expected the hot fast quick and dirty composting doesn't give us the best  
**[0:50:19-0:50:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:50:19):**  product which I mean you know good things come to those who wait right so there is one  
**[0:50:24-0:50:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:50:24):**  form of compost that is the best form of compost takes a year and they're bio it's done in  
**[0:50:32-0:50:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:50:32):**  a giant bioreacting you can do it smaller but they're doing chimneys in it perforated  
**[0:50:38-0:50:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:50:38):**  pipes yeah you're talking about the Johnson Sue bioreactor yeah and then the Lane Inghams  
**[0:50:44-0:50:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:50:44):**  adapted her her hot and fast style to be passive static aeration with chimneys only turning  
**[0:50:51-0:51:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:50:51):**  twice so this is this is a this is a thing that's taking everyone by storm and everyone's  
**[0:51:00-0:51:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:51:00):**  adapting very quickly because when you look at eh you look at oxidation you look at aeration  
**[0:51:06-0:51:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:51:06):**  you realize that the aerated aerobic compost heap is oxidized alkaline bacterial and they're  
**[0:51:15-0:51:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:51:15):**  going it's going amendments of that and high enough doses will lock up the nutrients in  
**[0:51:20-0:51:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:51:20):**  the soil so we don't want that and it will also make it vegetative growth predominantly  
**[0:51:27-0:51:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:51:27):**  leaving very little for reproductive growth so it's incredibly important that we recognize  
**[0:51:34-0:51:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:51:34):**  that composting is valuable we want soil organic matter but if you do a hot compost let that  
**[0:51:40-0:51:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:51:40):**  thing sit let it become fungal and even just a few weeks we'll start changing it to be  
**[0:51:45-0:51:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:51:45):**  more fungal as dr. Elaine Ingham has always said that you can do and is that the main  
**[0:51:51-0:51:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:51:51):**  thing that happens when you leave it longer like that the fungi and the mycorrhizal of  
**[0:51:56-0:52:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:51:56):**  activity is really the the difference of course because the thing is mycorrhizal fungi you  
**[0:52:03-0:52:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:52:03):**  know they a need plant roots and be they need it to not be disturbed so the fungi really  
**[0:52:09-0:52:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:52:09):**  can't do its work until things stop and because of the succession of the soil because all  
**[0:52:18-0:52:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:52:18):**  photosynthesis synthesis all photosynthesis in soil and on land is acidifying and water  
**[0:52:27-0:52:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:52:27):**  it's oxidizing because the oxygen they release it goes into the water which makes sense right  
**[0:52:32-0:52:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:52:32):**  yeah yeah and so like along these lines of recommendations for people and takeaways from  
**[0:52:40-0:52:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:52:40):**  the book what are some of the major things that changed about your perspective in the  
**[0:52:45-0:52:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:52:45):**  way that you interact with your own soils after doing all of this research well I was  
**[0:52:51-0:53:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:52:51):**  like the compost man Elaine Ingham has been a long been a mentor and friend still is and  
**[0:53:00-0:53:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:53:00):**  many of my students have taken her courses and and I now use the plants much more biochar  
**[0:53:16-0:53:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:53:16):**  and rock dust so I mean you can use nine percent of the soil profile in biochar like you can  
**[0:53:22-0:53:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:53:22):**  amend to nine percent and that it holds three times as much water in its math than its mass  
**[0:53:32-0:53:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:53:32):**  the biochar and so I just I just have really started to look at my soil completely different  
**[0:53:41-0:53:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:53:41):**  and then also understanding that unless my soil is in a certain condition it's a waste  
**[0:53:49-0:53:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:53:49):**  of money and water until I get it to that spot if I'm trying to do certain things so  
**[0:53:57-0:54:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:53:57):**  if I'm like oh I want a high yield I want beautiful crops I want nutrient dense and  
**[0:54:02-0:54:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:54:02):**  the soil is not there yet well all those goals need to be tabled until that soil is ready  
**[0:54:08-0:54:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:54:08):**  and so I've always been a soil grower I've always like kind of companion cover cropped  
**[0:54:14-0:54:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:54:14):**  everything and it looks wild it looks bushy it looks fun people have really you know latched  
**[0:54:22-0:54:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:54:22):**  on to that but now I'm kind of to the point where it's like I need to lean harder into  
**[0:54:28-0:54:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:54:28):**  that and use the plants as these incredible antenna which they are for energy both electromagnetic  
**[0:54:39-0:54:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:54:39):**  and also taking in the sun's you know solar radiation and transmitting it to other forms  
**[0:54:45-0:54:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:54:45):**  of energy and conducting that energy into the soil in ways that have long term staying  
**[0:54:56-0:55:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:54:56):**  power because when we have stressed plants they release monosaccharides and I know it's  
**[0:55:03-0:55:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:55:03):**  we have the metaphor of the soil that is cakes and cookies the exits well there's excretions  
**[0:55:08-0:55:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:55:08):**  and exudates too and exudation is like a shotgun blast at first until they start a conversation  
**[0:55:15-0:55:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:55:15):**  with an individual microbe then it gets sophisticated and it's the shotgun blasts of monosaccharides  
**[0:55:23-0:55:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:55:23):**  simple sugars that draws all the pests all the bad things and lets the soil food web  
**[0:55:29-0:55:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:55:29):**  know hey can you you know help me like step out bow out quickly and and it's polysaccharides  
**[0:55:38-0:55:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:55:38):**  from the healthy plants that are immune to pests up to a certain threshold they start  
**[0:55:46-0:55:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:55:46):**  beginning to make polysaccharides and then as they head up towards higher levels immunity  
**[0:55:51-0:56:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:55:51):**  get this they reinvest in the soil lipids fats that they developed internally so I mean  
**[0:56:00-0:56:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:56:00):**  I get the photosynthesis they're you know they're investing the soil they get this great  
**[0:56:04-0:56:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:56:04):**  return but now at their highest levels of health what do they do with their investment  
**[0:56:11-0:56:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:56:11):**  you know they yes they they invest in their seed and fruit no doubt but this return of  
**[0:56:17-0:56:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:56:17):**  lipids of fats to the soil along with polysaccharides which are long chains of carbon long long  
**[0:56:24-0:56:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:56:24):**  complex sugars and it it it amplifies just like you would a guitar amplifier it amplifies  
**[0:56:33-0:56:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:56:33):**  so humification through mycorrhizal fungi so I I can't kind of get away from that and  
**[0:56:40-0:56:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:56:40):**  so I'm like you got to go with the good plants and then you've got to feed your plants so  
**[0:56:47-0:56:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:56:47):**  I want to hold water in there as much as possible because that automatically like we talked  
**[0:56:51-0:56:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:56:51):**  about lowers the pH because you got that hydrogen and then holds more water there's more H than  
**[0:56:56-0:57:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:56:56):**  O and it's also not a form of oxygen that people I mean not people but microbes are  
**[0:57:02-0:57:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:57:02):**  using to oxidize things with and so you end up with a more more lower pH more reduced  
**[0:57:10-0:57:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:57:10):**  soil and so I would I would just be like I do now foliar feeding things consistently  
**[0:57:18-0:57:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:57:18):**  letting the plants do the work and moving outward in a nucleic fashion so I did the  
**[0:57:28-0:57:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:57:28):**  thing that I usually do which is go as big as possible but then I ran out of water and  
**[0:57:34-0:57:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:57:34):**  then knowing what I know now it's not so cool to be like oh look at this plant you know  
**[0:57:42-0:57:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:57:42):**  I barely gave it any water it still gives me seeds and it's this hearty thing that's  
**[0:57:47-0:57:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:57:47):**  cool you know but but that doesn't help the world that doesn't help your future doesn't  
**[0:57:53-0:57:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:57:53):**  help with nutrient density you know what I mean it just shows that it could happen and  
**[0:57:58-0:58:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:57:58):**  so I lost my my my my I lost my passion for watching the extremes and like proving what's  
**[0:58:10-0:58:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:58:10):**  possible at the extremes because I realized like you said what can scale up what can scale  
**[0:58:18-0:58:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:58:18):**  up is also what's easiest and most powerful for us on the one-to-one basis of the gardening  
**[0:58:24-0:58:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:58:24):**  level and that well it sounds like you really just put all your efforts there into the soil  
**[0:58:31-0:58:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:58:31):**  more than you know just the abundance of plants and all the potential of what can grow in  
**[0:58:36-0:58:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:58:36):**  a space and in the extremes of conditions like you mentioned and by putting or redoubling  
**[0:58:41-0:58:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:58:41):**  your efforts just on the soil you've seen not only you know the possibility of what  
**[0:58:47-0:58:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:58:47):**  can come out of it but some of the most beautiful expressions of those plants because they really  
**[0:58:53-0:59:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:58:53):**  have what they need to thrive yeah it's been actually kind of interesting this is the first  
**[0:59:00-0:59:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:59:00):**  year that I've had melons that tasted better than any melon I've ever eaten from a store  
**[0:59:06-0:59:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:59:06):**  or otherwise this was yeah and this was the first year that like growing tomatoes was  
**[0:59:17-0:59:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:59:17):**  just the easiest thing in the world like it's easy because yeah yeah and and it's and and  
**[0:59:24-0:59:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:59:24):**  I also understand why peppers and and tomatoes are doing so well is because my soil is at  
**[0:59:30-0:59:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:59:30):**  that e h and and ph range that it favors it favors nightshades so if we look at the classic  
**[0:59:39-0:59:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:59:39):**  Elaine Ingham chart that I that I adapted with her for my books we're like two or three  
**[0:59:48-0:59:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:59:48):**  sections in from the left when we ideally need to be two to maybe even three more levels  
**[0:59:55-1:00:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=0:59:55):**  down so it kind of it it kind of it's humbling but it's such a deep in like it's I'm deeply  
**[1:00:05-1:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:00:05):**  informed now about what's possible why certain things are the way they are and what needs  
**[1:00:14-1:00:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:00:14):**  to happen to climb this mountain right that I'm working on I'm on 90 acres on top of a  
**[1:00:21-1:00:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:00:21):**  mountain but it there's not enough water the well goes dry for three months of the year  
**[1:00:28-1:00:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:00:28):**  super challenging site and so I'm just I'm really understanding what's possible and how  
**[1:00:35-1:00:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:00:35):**  it needs to move forward like for instance we're going to be doing large scale biochar  
**[1:00:41-1:00:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:00:41):**  I'm going to be watering it down probably with a while pre-treating it I should say  
**[1:00:46-1:00:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:00:46):**  with iron sulfate so that when I make this biochar it's all highly magnetic so it will  
**[1:00:55-1:01:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:00:55):**  hold nutrients and water in the soil at an incredible level and it will also reduce the  
**[1:01:00-1:01:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:01:00):**  fire potential of this landscape just by holding more water but also by taking out all the  
**[1:01:07-1:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:01:07):**  brush and all the the the overgrowth which is you know I'm in the fire area I you know  
**[1:01:16-1:01:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:01:16):**  we had a two acre fire on our road two weeks ago so it's we are in the most dangerous possible  
**[1:01:24-1:01:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:01:24):**  place that we could be it feels like often because we're on a very long road off of a  
**[1:01:32-1:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:01:32):**  very long back country road and like the day after you know and I got nothing but love  
**[1:01:42-1:01:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:01:42):**  for everyone you know that's me I love people but after that two acre fire you know driving  
**[1:01:49-1:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:01:49):**  down the road and seeing someone walk along the road smoking a cigarette was like I can  
**[1:01:55-1:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:01:55):**  only imagine like scratch like a chalkboard for me like that's what it is and I I try  
**[1:02:02-1:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:02:02):**  not to get intense right because then you start spiraling and then you start looking  
**[1:02:06-1:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:02:06):**  and scrolling through the news and all that but the reality is we can change these landscapes  
**[1:02:13-1:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:02:13):**  these landscapes are extraordinarily stressed they were all and this is something that I  
**[1:02:19-1:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:02:19):**  have not really revealed publicly many places but California was all logged and the way  
**[1:02:28-1:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:02:28):**  loggers get logs down is they create these roads that point towards the actual watershed  
**[1:02:37-1:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:02:37):**  downward so they increase the runoff water flow off the mountains drying them out and  
**[1:02:46-1:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:02:46):**  this happened decades on top of removing all that root matter and everything else that  
**[1:02:51-1:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:02:51):**  hold the soil together yeah and so we suddenly have a situation where we have people yeah  
**[1:02:58-1:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:02:58):**  they held back fire no doubt but they literally re-engineered the landscape the opposite of  
**[1:03:04-1:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:03:04):**  key line design folks they did opposite of swales they did that's destroy and gully the  
**[1:03:11-1:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:03:11):**  entire California landscape in order to get these logs down faster and then never fixed  
**[1:03:18-1:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:03:18):**  it so that's that's another thing and it's hard legally and people who are in California  
**[1:03:25-1:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:03:25):**  will know what I'm talking about but it's really hard legally to do some of this work  
**[1:03:30-1:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:03:30):**  and it's hard permitting wise cost wise to to pay for it because they cost so much to  
**[1:03:40-1:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:03:40):**  do anything to just get the permission you have to pay to get permission that when you  
**[1:03:45-1:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:03:45):**  get down to doing it it's it's it's just like you already lost all your money and I know  
**[1:03:50-1:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:03:50):**  so many people that have tried this started the process and then they make up things in  
**[1:03:56-1:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:03:56):**  the middle of it I'm talking about family members people I know dearly who had homes  
**[1:04:02-1:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:04:02):**  that they were going to build in California and extend were continuously extorted by local  
**[1:04:08-1:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:04:08):**  politicians and like bureaucrats out of their ability to do this and this is the number  
**[1:04:16-1:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:04:16):**  one reason we have homeless is that it is impossible to build affordable homes in California  
**[1:04:22-1:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:04:22):**  Washington and Oregon anyway sorry about that tangent but it's like no it's okay it's all  
**[1:04:29-1:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:04:29):**  relevant topics yeah and permaculture we talk about creating affordable housing one of my  
**[1:04:34-1:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:04:34):**  good friends man I'm getting chills talking about him I love this guy Miguel Elliott can  
**[1:04:39-1:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:04:39):**  make homes for basically nothing out of clay which is everywhere here and these houses  
**[1:04:48-1:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:04:48):**  are fireproof yet they're illegal and they're they're earthquake proof fireproof they're  
**[1:04:55-1:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:04:55):**  cheap they're honorable structures that people can create themselves their hands and have  
**[1:05:01-1:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:05:01):**  dignity and self-respect man who I feel like my heart is so stirred deeply by the plight  
**[1:05:13-1:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:05:13):**  that we are all in right now because it's like their situation is as tenuous as ours  
**[1:05:20-1:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:05:20):**  is on perched on this mountaintop with these fires happening our whole society in various  
**[1:05:26-1:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:05:26):**  ways some overlapping and may feel unfair to those people but it is this poor design  
**[1:05:35-1:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:05:35):**  it's this lack of understanding with the way that people work with the way that nature  
**[1:05:40-1:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:05:40):**  works and the way that things work over time that has led us to this this very scary precipice  
**[1:05:49-1:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:05:49):**  but I know that it is through podcasts like this and and and work like the work I'm doing  
**[1:05:58-1:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:05:58):**  and many other people are are working on sometimes behind the scenes and sometimes you know trying  
**[1:06:04-1:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:06:04):**  to tell everyone about it but it's this work that we were all engaged in together to try  
**[1:06:11-1:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:06:11):**  to make sense of our world again to try to get us back on the path of just wanting to  
**[1:06:18-1:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:06:18):**  make things right because we can because I feel like for years now people have believed  
**[1:06:24-1:06:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:06:24):**  now they believe that this rumor that we can't do anything to make things better that this  
**[1:06:29-1:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:06:29):**  is the way politics are this is the way the world is this is the way California is when  
**[1:06:34-1:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:06:34):**  we are active participants we have power and the world and people their hearts their minds  
**[1:06:42-1:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:06:42):**  are responsive.  
**[1:06:46-1:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:06:46):**  Just sit with the wait for that a little bit and kind of meditate on the concept of what  
**[1:06:52-1:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:06:52):**  it means on a day-to-day level for people to internalize that and do the work to reconnect  
**[1:06:59-1:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:06:59):**  both at the community level to the environment even you know seemingly unrelated disciplines  
**[1:07:08-1:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:07:08):**  economics politics it all connects and it's all in drastic need of change for us to really  
**[1:07:15-1:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:07:15):**  move forward and so on that note Matt let's wrap things up but can you give our listeners  
**[1:07:23-1:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/matt-powers-regen-soil/#t=1:07:23):**  some direction as to where they can go to find out more find your book and get in touch?

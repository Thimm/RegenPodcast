**[0:01:23-0:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:01:23):**  go beyond sustainability.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:01:25):**  My guest today is Elvira deBrigit, the author of the new book Why We Farm, which is an investigation  
**[0:01:31-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:01:31):**  into the whole truth about life as a modern day farmer.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:01:35):**  Now viewed through the lens of the environment within the Cape Bay Valley of Northern California,  
**[0:01:39-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:01:39):**  each chapter features a different model of farming.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:01:42):**  In each profile, farmers share their stories behind their work and their lives on the farm,  
**[0:01:47-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:01:47):**  the business side of production, the personal challenges they face, and words of advice  
**[0:01:51-0:01:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:01:51):**  for the would-be farmer.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:01:53):**  The book asks hard questions and gives a reverent yet realistic picture of a thriving local  
**[0:01:58-0:01:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:01:58):**  food system.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:01:59):**  Now in this interview, Elvira talks about how she first came to the Cape Bay Valley  
**[0:02:04-0:02:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:02:04):**  and her motivations behind wanting to live a farming lifestyle.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:02:08):**  We talk about how the farmers profiled in her book tell a larger story of modern farming  
**[0:02:13-0:02:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:02:13):**  in the United States and even the trends and challenges facing the agricultural industry  
**[0:02:18-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:02:18):**  around the world.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:02:19):**  Elvira also gives a unique perspective into the growing community outreach that is strengthening  
**[0:02:24-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:02:24):**  the bonds in the valley and fostering a larger network of resilience that should be inspiring  
**[0:02:29-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:02:29):**  for anyone living in a rural community.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:02:32):**  With that said, I'll hand things over to Elvira.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:02:34):**  Hello, Elvira.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:02:35):**  Thank you so much for joining me on the podcast today.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:02:39):**  Yeah, thanks Oliver for inviting me.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:02:41):**  How are you doing today?  
**[0:02:42-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:02:42):**  Oh, great.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:02:43):**  How are things in the Cape Bay Valley of California?  
**[0:02:47-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:02:47):**  Well, we've been having a streak of hot weather but that's good for ripening stone fruit,  
**[0:02:55-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:02:55):**  peaches and plums are coming in.  
**[0:02:57-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:02:57):**  Excellent.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:02:58):**  Well, hey, we'll get more into the area in which you live in a little while but since  
**[0:03:02-0:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:03:02):**  I've got so many questions about your book, how about we just jump right into the first  
**[0:03:05-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:03:05):**  questions.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:03:06):**  Yes.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:03:07):**  All right.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:03:08):**  So, could you start by telling me a little bit about your background?  
**[0:03:11-0:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:03:11):**  How did you become interested in farming and what is it that brought you to the Cape Bay  
**[0:03:14-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:03:14):**  Valley specifically?  
**[0:03:16-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:03:16):**  Well, it all really started with a desire for fresh wholesome food.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:03:23):**  Mostly after my first child was born, I just realized that it was really hard to find good  
**[0:03:30-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:03:30):**  organic food.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:03:32):**  This was like 25 years ago and even in the Bay Area back then which is where I grew up,  
**[0:03:39-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:03:39):**  you couldn't just walk into a grocery store and buy organic food.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:03:42):**  It was really challenging.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:03:45):**  So, I started traveling and looking for places to live in the country and I loved scavenging  
**[0:03:53-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:03:53):**  for any fruit that was left on neglected trees in the city.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:03:58):**  I started dreaming of living in the country.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:04:01):**  Yes, I moved around in the 20s and looking for a place that really met those needs of  
**[0:04:09-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:04:09):**  healthy living, fresh food, good water and strong community.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:04:15):**  Eventually, best by luck really, circumstances brought me to Cape Bay Valley.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:04:23):**  I found that there's really a good combination of those three core needs that I had in a  
**[0:04:31-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:04:31):**  very down to earth way.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:04:33):**  There's not a lot of woo-woo energy here.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:04:38):**  It's just very practical down to earth people and like practical progressives slowly gaining  
**[0:04:45-0:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:04:45):**  ground here over the last 30, 40 years.  
**[0:04:50-0:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:04:50):**  So, I've been here 17 years and that's the longest that I've ever been in one location.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:05:03):**  Very nice.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:05:04):**  I just can relate to that search for idyllic food sources and a simpler way of life.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:05:09):**  Now, I know in your book, Why We Farm, you profile a number of organic farms in the Cape  
**[0:05:15-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:05:15):**  Bay Valley in North Central California where you are and you also draw parallels to the  
**[0:05:20-0:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:05:20):**  larger farming industry as a whole.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:05:22):**  So, how are these farms representative of the American farming industry and how are  
**[0:05:27-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:05:27):**  they unique?  
**[0:05:28-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:05:28):**  Yeah, it's a good question.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:05:32):**  Because small family farms are really facing the same difficulties that farms all over  
**[0:05:39-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:05:39):**  the United States are facing.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:05:44):**  Namely the real concentration of capital in big ag and a lot of regulation that is harder  
**[0:05:52-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:05:52):**  for small farms to keep up with.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:05:57):**  So yeah, they're facing the same difficulties and they're unique in that this area maybe  
**[0:06:06-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:06:06):**  because of the geography and the history they had kept small land holdings.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:06:12):**  So big agriculture, agribusiness didn't get such a foothold here in this valley and that  
**[0:06:20-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:06:20):**  enabled or kind of forced the farmers here to really become creative and think about  
**[0:06:27-0:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:06:27):**  how they could sustain their farms.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:06:32):**  So, they've out of necessity looked for creative ways to market what they have and there were  
**[0:06:42-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:06:42):**  a few key players that came along in the 70s and we can talk more about that.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:06:48):**  It might come up later.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:06:52):**  Well, so there's really a wide range of farming techniques that you've profiled in Why We  
**[0:06:57-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:06:57):**  Farm.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:06:58):**  From conventional to organic, you've got single specialty crop producers to wide product diversity.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:07:04):**  There are stories of young farmers and old farmers, single family farms and even corporations.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:07:10):**  My question is, what among this diverse group did you find that connects them and what are  
**[0:07:15-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:07:15):**  some of the commonalities that readers of the book could learn from?  
**[0:07:19-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:07:19):**  Yeah, I'm wondering if they all would see that they're really connected but there have  
**[0:07:26-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:07:26):**  been some real efforts to connect this wide diverse community.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:07:32):**  Again, they all face these similar difficulties and also I found that everyone that I talked  
**[0:07:43-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:07:43):**  to maybe to different degrees but they all had a real desire to be stewards of the land.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:07:49):**  They really had a love of the place where they were living.  
**[0:07:54-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:07:54):**  And then, yeah, they have this need for community that I think that's really what people can  
**[0:08:04-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:08:04):**  learn from these stories.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:08:07):**  Just how these farmers, the creativity that they came up with and how they learn to work  
**[0:08:14-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:08:14):**  together.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:08:15):**  Sure, I believe it is something that you said in the introduction of your book that all  
**[0:08:19-0:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:08:19):**  of these people are really here by choice and they really love where they are because  
**[0:08:24-0:08:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:08:24):**  farming is quite a difficult way to make a living especially in modern times and like  
**[0:08:29-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:08:29):**  you said with some of the regulations and stuff that they have to overcome or that are  
**[0:08:33-0:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:08:33):**  tough to get around.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:08:36):**  So like this passion and stewardship seems from the profiles that I read is really one  
**[0:08:42-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:08:42):**  of the connecting features of all of the people profiled in this book.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:08:47):**  Yeah, that's right.  
**[0:08:50-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:08:50):**  Yeah, like I was thinking that of all to I didn't meet anyone who was really cynical  
**[0:09:00-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:09:00):**  about their career choice.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:09:03):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:09:06):**  So one of my favorite stories in this book is that of Sika Hills Farm and Ranch.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:09:10):**  They're a very multifaceted operation and are fully owned by, I hope I'm saying this  
**[0:09:15-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:09:15):**  right, the Yocha Dihi tribe.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:09:18):**  Yep, that's right.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:09:19):**  And they're indigenous to that area.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:09:21):**  Could you tell my listeners a little bit about how their organization has grown and how some  
**[0:09:26-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:09:26):**  of their more recent efforts have helped to create a high quality personal brand as well  
**[0:09:31-0:09:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:09:31):**  as community cooperation and collaboration?  
**[0:09:33-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:09:33):**  Yeah, well I don't want to give it all away but it is a really interesting story.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:09:40):**  They of course had a lot of difficulties with European people coming in, the California  
**[0:09:49-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:09:49):**  Gold Rush and all that history that really, they're still today a really small tribe and  
**[0:10:00-0:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:10:00):**  they eventually did get a land grant from the government to have a farm down in the  
**[0:10:07-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:10:07):**  central part of the valley, which by the way is some of the colder, that's like where the  
**[0:10:15-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:10:15):**  cold spot is in the valley so it's like some of the least ideal growing area.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:10:21):**  But they, yeah so they had to just lease out their farming in the beginning because they  
**[0:10:27-0:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:10:27):**  didn't have enough capital to start their own farm once they got this land.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:10:32):**  But you know as times have changed they went from having a little bingo hall to then having  
**[0:10:42-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:10:42):**  a really nice casino now and they've been able to use that income in order to develop  
**[0:10:51-0:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:10:51):**  their farming more, which was a choice that they made in order to really invest in where  
**[0:10:58-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:10:58):**  they live and in the land and in the community.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:11:02):**  So they kind of started out a little bit by accident with growing these grapes just for  
**[0:11:11-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:11:11):**  landscape use but then they decided, hey let's try making some wine with these grapes and  
**[0:11:18-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:11:18):**  then they had some success with that and thought, oh yeah and they had also bought a neighboring  
**[0:11:24-0:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:11:24):**  property that already had walnuts on it and they saw that you know even just selling those  
**[0:11:30-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:11:30):**  on the open market was you know some way to diversify with their income portfolio.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:11:37):**  And now they have really grown into having their own brand of olive oil and vinegar and  
**[0:11:46-0:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:11:46):**  wine are three of the big ones but also nuts and they're making flavored nuts.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:11:53):**  Just in the last couple of years they have built this amazing facility right across the  
**[0:11:58-0:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:11:58):**  street from the casino which is an olive mill, state of the art olive mill and that's open  
**[0:12:04-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:12:04):**  you know to all olive farmers to come and have their olives pressed and there's a tasting  
**[0:12:12-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:12:12):**  room there for customers to come in and see the operation and have some food and just  
**[0:12:19-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:12:19):**  have another experience while they're here in the Cape Bay Valley.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:12:23):**  That's fantastic.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:12:24):**  Such a great story of sort of industrious growth and using sort of value-added products  
**[0:12:31-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:12:31):**  to even bring further income into what's otherwise kind of a cutthroat industry in farming.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:12:38):**  Now what are some of the unique things that the farmers that you work with do that will  
**[0:12:43-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:12:43):**  make a difference to their community in either the long and the short run?  
**[0:12:48-0:12:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:12:48):**  I think that what's really unique is the many ways in which the farmers here are working  
**[0:12:55-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:12:55):**  to have outreach with the public.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:12:58):**  They're you know on one level working with their own customers to have you know really  
**[0:13:05-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:13:05):**  close consumer farmer relations so and that kind of started in the 70s with Full Belly  
**[0:13:12-0:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:13:12):**  having direct relationships with chefs in the Bay Area and also starting up this CSA,  
**[0:13:21-0:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:13:21):**  the community supported agriculture subscription boxes that you know they have newsletters  
**[0:13:30-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:13:30):**  that go out to those customers and they're really you know trying to have a close relationship  
**[0:13:38-0:13:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:13:38):**  and that you know really benefits everyone by the consumer having more education about  
**[0:13:45-0:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:13:45):**  what's going on on the farm and what it takes to grow this food.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:13:50):**  That in turn is you know also trying to educate policy makers and so I think the farmers here,  
**[0:13:58-0:14:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:13:58):**  some of them anyway, are really focused on yeah being part of you know the Farm Bureau  
**[0:14:08-0:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:14:08):**  or the Ecological Farming Association or many different organizations that so they're politically  
**[0:14:14-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:14:14):**  active and trying to educate people about you know what it will take to help small farms  
**[0:14:20-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:14:20):**  survive.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:14:24):**  Yeah and then there's also community things that they've done like organizing here at  
**[0:14:29-0:14:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:14:29):**  Cape Valley Vision.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:14:30):**  It has been an ag task force for the last 10 years or more that has really worked on  
**[0:14:37-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:14:37):**  branding of quality reputation for the Cape Valley.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:14:42):**  Fantastic and I heard that there was also an effort to create a Cape Valley brand itself  
**[0:14:50-0:14:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:14:50):**  in order to increase marketing potential and value to that area.  
**[0:14:55-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:14:55):**  Right, so that's what I was just referring to that they've you know really with this  
**[0:15:01-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:15:01):**  ag task force brought together all these diverse farmers and non-farmers into one room talking  
**[0:15:09-0:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:15:09):**  about what they could do and they were able to create a brand for the Cape Valley.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:15:16):**  So for instance like the farmer veggie boxes that I used to see when I first moved here  
**[0:15:21-0:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:15:21):**  just had the farm name on it maybe you know if it wasn't some generic box and now there  
**[0:15:28-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:15:28):**  are boxes that the farmers can buy together as a community that have the Cape Valley logo  
**[0:15:33-0:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:15:33):**  on it and also logos for signs as you drive up the highway that show Cape Valley grown  
**[0:15:43-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:15:43):**  in the Cape Valley.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:15:46):**  And out of that effort for branding also came this Cape Valley farm shop which is a way  
**[0:15:54-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:15:54):**  for people who are just growing you know on a smaller scale one or two crops for them  
**[0:15:59-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:15:59):**  to you know join with other farmers and sell their produce all together through one outlet  
**[0:16:07-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:16:07):**  called Cape Valley Farm Shop which is online and for a while had a storefront in Vacaville  
**[0:16:13-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:16:13):**  so yeah just really promoting the reputation of the quality food that's grown here.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:16:22):**  That's really inspiring.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:16:24):**  Now on another note and going back to what we talked about with the passion of the farmers  
**[0:16:29-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:16:29):**  that you profiled for land stewardship I know they also have a major concern from those  
**[0:16:35-0:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:16:35):**  that you've interviewed about their relationship with their environment.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:16:39):**  So obviously the long running drought in California has affected that area a lot so things like  
**[0:16:44-0:16:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:16:44):**  water management and drought resistant crops are big focuses.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:16:47):**  So how do many of these farmers see their role as stewards of the land and how are they  
**[0:16:52-0:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:16:52):**  investing in the long term health of their environment?  
**[0:16:55-0:17:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:16:55):**  Yeah it's interesting I wonder if I had done these interviews with farmers this year it  
**[0:17:02-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:17:02):**  would be a little different because I was definitely interviewing during the drought  
**[0:17:05-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:17:05):**  and people were really concerned about that and that you know the drought seems to be  
**[0:17:11-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:17:11):**  something in California that comes around every I don't know every 10 years or so.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:17:19):**  We yeah the farmers here in Cape Valley have done a lot in terms of their different long  
**[0:17:27-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:17:27):**  term you know work with the environment.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:17:32):**  One common thing that I saw was really focusing on having hedgerows that will increase the  
**[0:17:39-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:17:39):**  native pollinators in the area.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:17:41):**  There's quite a few farms that have recognized the importance of doing that and also really  
**[0:17:48-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:17:48):**  health.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:17:49):**  There's you know full belly and river dog farm you know just bringing in lots of compost  
**[0:17:59-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:17:59):**  and lots of amendments and also really trying to practice some no till methods.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:18:07):**  That's like a more recent thing that people are trying to do.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:18:13):**  Yeah there's been so many.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:18:16):**  There's the energy shed movement a few years ago to really see if we could create a sustainable  
**[0:18:26-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:18:26):**  energy source here in the valley which was determined that it would be better for people  
**[0:18:33-0:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:18:33):**  to try and do that individually but it was just those kind of forward thinking efforts  
**[0:18:40-0:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:18:40):**  to really try and think of this valley as one region that you protect.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:18:49):**  That's fantastic.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:18:50):**  It sounds like you know even if the conversation eventually comes to the conclusion that it's  
**[0:18:55-0:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:18:55):**  better for things to be implemented on an individual scale just the fact that your community  
**[0:18:59-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:18:59):**  is having those conversations and considering working together from the beginning is really  
**[0:19:05-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:19:05):**  inspiring.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:19:06):**  Yeah it really is and some of that developed out of the casino coming and getting bigger  
**[0:19:15-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:19:15):**  and people not being okay with that and then conversations coming about.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:19:22):**  It was like well how are we all going to work together as a community and this big influence  
**[0:19:28-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:19:28):**  coming in with all more traffic and so out of those conversations came a few farmers  
**[0:19:36-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:19:36):**  and some of the leaders of the tribe working together to create this KK Valley vision organization  
**[0:19:45-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:19:45):**  which dealt a lot with agriculture but also with transportation issues and tourism issues  
**[0:19:53-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:19:53):**  and yeah they had a few different task forces.  
**[0:19:56-0:19:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:19:56):**  That's such a great story.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:19:58):**  Now while you were interviewing these farmers what were some of the things that surprised  
**[0:20:02-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:20:02):**  you most or that you learned from your conversations that you didn't know before?  
**[0:20:09-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:20:09):**  Well again like I said about how they all just really loved their work and felt like  
**[0:20:15-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:20:15):**  they were in the right place doing what they needed to do even though sometimes it can  
**[0:20:23-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:20:23):**  be really difficult.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:20:24):**  I mean they can be really on the edge of solvency and yeah and one thing that really surprised  
**[0:20:33-0:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:20:33):**  me was how much coopertition there is that goes on you know even though some of these  
**[0:20:40-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:20:40):**  farms are you know ostensibly competing for the same markets down mostly in the Bay Area  
**[0:20:47-0:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:20:47):**  and Sacramento they have worked out ways to cooperate so they'll even you know share cold  
**[0:20:58-0:21:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:20:58):**  storage space and then share trucks that are delivering out they'll you know work together  
**[0:21:04-0:21:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:21:04):**  to make those deliveries happen so there's less driving needed.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:21:09):**  That was one of the things that really surprised me.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:21:14):**  Now through your research what are some of the most urgent issues that family farmers  
**[0:21:19-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:21:19):**  are facing these days and what are some of the ways that you see them dealing with these  
**[0:21:23-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:21:23):**  obstacles?  
**[0:21:24-0:21:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:21:24):**  Yeah I think one of the biggest obstacles is just this trend towards you know abundant  
**[0:21:35-0:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:21:35):**  cheap food in the market and how that you know how these small farmers are trying to  
**[0:21:46-0:21:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:21:46):**  deal with that they're sending this trend for farmers to be you know public policy instead  
**[0:21:53-0:22:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:21:53):**  of helping them like cut their costs and stuff but you know that can only go so far and so  
**[0:22:03-0:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:22:03):**  that's that's a big issue and yeah creating these relationships with people to educate  
**[0:22:11-0:22:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:22:11):**  about that and advocating for policy changes like one thing that you know people kind of  
**[0:22:21-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:22:21):**  assume is that oh well you can just mechanize agriculture to save costs and to deal with  
**[0:22:28-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:22:28):**  loss of labor that is really having a big impact and you know but for the small farmer  
**[0:22:34-0:22:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:22:34):**  that's just a big expense again you really have to have a lot of capital in order to  
**[0:22:40-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:22:40):**  afford these you know these machines and so it's just hard to have good stewardship of  
**[0:22:51-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:22:51):**  the land when the market forces are you know out there just trying the macro trend is to  
**[0:22:58-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:22:58):**  just have cheaper food but there is you know a small group of people hopefully a growing  
**[0:23:06-0:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:23:06):**  group which understands the need to support farmers in a different way and so yeah I think  
**[0:23:14-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:23:14):**  the farmers here are really trying to you know expand on that and yeah there's been  
**[0:23:20-0:23:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:23:20):**  some amazing things that have come out of that with you know growing CSA movements and  
**[0:23:29-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:23:29):**  just a growing awareness about you know how organic food was not only good for your own  
**[0:23:34-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:23:34):**  health but also the environment.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:23:37):**  Yeah fantastic.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:23:39):**  I definitely count myself in that group of people you mentioned who realized that farmers  
**[0:23:44-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:23:44):**  need to be supported and be valued for the work that they do especially in you know these  
**[0:23:52-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:23:52):**  times of industrial farming and increasing amounts of toxicity in our food supply and  
**[0:23:58-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:23:58):**  like you said the macro trend of just focusing solely on production even at the expense of  
**[0:24:05-0:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:24:05):**  the health of the land and the food products that come out of it and I really like this  
**[0:24:10-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:24:10):**  book for giving an inside look at the opinions and the lifestyles of farmers from tons of  
**[0:24:17-0:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:24:17):**  different backgrounds and all different types of operations.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:24:21):**  In fact I really love the stories like the ones of owners of Pastor 42 who admittedly  
**[0:24:27-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:24:27):**  had a big learning curve after being wolf volunteers and then had to change their plans  
**[0:24:32-0:24:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:24:32):**  and practices a lot when they moved their grass-fed cattle operation from Oregon to  
**[0:24:37-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:24:37):**  the Cape Valley and also the profile of Annie Henner at LeapFrog Farm who learned through  
**[0:24:45-0:24:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:24:45):**  gardening jobs and trial and error while getting her one woman show off the ground.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:24:49):**  I mean they're great examples of where many of my listeners are with their own ambitions  
**[0:24:55-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:24:55):**  and their own learning experiences.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:24:57):**  Now what are some of the key pieces of advice that you've heard from farmers who didn't  
**[0:25:02-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:25:02):**  grow up farming and essentially started from scratch?  
**[0:25:06-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:25:06):**  Yeah some of the big pieces of advice was to do internships and do as many as you can  
**[0:25:16-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:25:16):**  and take your time with that and it's been amazing to see what interns who have come  
**[0:25:22-0:25:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:25:22):**  through the Cape Valley have been able to do in other areas of the world.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:25:27):**  We have some people who have gone back to Ohio and Minnesota where it's mostly corn  
**[0:25:34-0:25:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:25:34):**  and soy and started vegetable farming and so yeah that's amazing.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:25:41):**  But getting back to your question, another thing that really surprised me was that farmers  
**[0:25:49-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:25:49):**  saying you don't have to start by buying the land, you can lease the land and then grow  
**[0:25:56-0:26:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:25:56):**  your business and then buy land once you've got capital going and got your markets and  
**[0:26:04-0:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:26:04):**  you feel secure.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:26:08):**  And there's also, yeah I learned that there are a lot of organizations that can really  
**[0:26:13-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:26:13):**  help farmers, yeah from Pastor 42 that once they learned about the Farmed Consumer Legal  
**[0:26:21-0:26:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:26:21):**  Defense Fund they felt secure in being able to create this small dairy and so many of  
**[0:26:31-0:26:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:26:31):**  those are going out of business but they're starting one from their own creativity but  
**[0:26:38-0:26:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:26:38):**  feeling like they have the security of a group and organization behind them.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:26:45):**  And also with interns too, there are groups like Mesa where they can help educate interns  
**[0:26:56-0:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:26:56):**  as a group and help farmers to make sure that they're doing everything legal in terms of  
**[0:27:02-0:27:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:27:02):**  taking on interns and so there's definitely a lot of help out there and that was something  
**[0:27:12-0:27:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:27:12):**  that the farmers here really shared with me.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:27:17):**  And yeah Annie Henner at Leapfrog Farm was so great how she was saying that she never  
**[0:27:23-0:27:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:27:23):**  thought that she would want to go into farming even though she saw it around her as she was  
**[0:27:28-0:27:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:27:28):**  growing up, she was spending time on farms as a child but wasn't interested in what was  
**[0:27:34-0:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:27:34):**  really going on there and how that changed as like you said she took these little gardening  
**[0:27:41-0:27:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:27:41):**  jobs in college and then one thing led to another.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:27:46):**  And she really talks about how the community here is really important to her from starting  
**[0:27:54-0:28:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:27:54):**  out from scratch, just realizing that she could ask another farmer for help with fixing  
**[0:28:02-0:28:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:28:02):**  her tractor or yeah just all kinds of advice.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:28:07):**  And she has been really active with the Young Farmers Guild, I forget the name of it exactly  
**[0:28:14-0:28:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:28:14):**  but that's another organization that she has found helpful.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:28:19):**  Yeah I'm really glad you mentioned these organizations.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:28:22):**  Like you said the Young Farmers Guild and the legal action fund that you spoke about  
**[0:28:28-0:28:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:28:28):**  that helped the owners of Pasture 42.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:28:31):**  I mean if I remember specifically they had to find a creative way to allow unpasteurized  
**[0:28:36-0:28:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:28:36):**  milk products into market because as it currently stands under FDA regulations in the United  
**[0:28:41-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:28:41):**  States you can't sell unpasteurized dairy products to consumers directly.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:28:49):**  And basically they found a way around it by having basically a membership of consumers  
**[0:28:56-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:28:56):**  that directly bought shares of the cattle that they have on their ranch and in that  
**[0:29:02-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:29:02):**  way they can get the dairy products directly without it having to go to market.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:29:07):**  I love loopholes like that but it definitely exposes some of the idiosyncrasies and maybe  
**[0:29:15-0:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:29:15):**  even call them corrupt aspects of our agricultural regulations.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:29:21):**  So for anybody who's got dairy farms that may be a creative or viable way to stick to  
**[0:29:28-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:29:28):**  your ethics or offer higher quality products when it's seemingly impossible otherwise.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:29:33):**  Yeah, yeah they were just really lucky to have met some other people who were exploring  
**[0:29:39-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:29:39):**  this option and they were ready to jump in.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:29:46):**  Over regulation is, well I don't know if it's over regulation but just the differences in  
**[0:29:51-0:29:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:29:51):**  regulation for big agribusiness compared to small farms.  
**[0:29:56-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:29:56):**  That's one thing that I love about this project is that we really need to be able to differentiate  
**[0:30:04-0:30:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:30:04):**  and have different regulations for different types of farms because it's really a burden  
**[0:30:10-0:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:30:10):**  on the small farms to have.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:30:12):**  Well some of the extra costs of some of the regulations like the Clean Water Act was one  
**[0:30:20-0:30:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:30:20):**  thing that farmers mentioned and the minimum wage doesn't really work with how seasonal  
**[0:30:26-0:30:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:30:26):**  labor is, they can't pay overtime to people during this time of high harvest.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:30:36):**  So yeah, it's tricky but people are being creative about things like that also in terms  
**[0:30:41-0:30:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:30:41):**  of well having maybe a collective workforce that can go different farms through the summer  
**[0:30:50-0:30:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:30:50):**  or spread it out so that they're working the same amount of hours but not on one farm so  
**[0:30:56-0:31:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:30:56):**  that way it doesn't get into the high cost of having overtime.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:31:04):**  Yeah those are all good points and they're very tricky to navigate in a legal system.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:31:07):**  But hey, just before we wrap up here I just want to say to all my listeners that I highly  
**[0:31:12-0:31:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:31:12):**  recommend this book.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:31:13):**  I get a lot of authors through here on the podcast almost all of whom are profiling different  
**[0:31:19-0:31:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:31:19):**  types of farming methods or natural building methods and it's a lot of instructional material.  
**[0:31:24-0:31:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:31:24):**  And this one really stuck out to me as, especially for people who aspire to go into farming for  
**[0:31:30-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:31:30):**  themselves, the profiles of the farmers and the operations in this book really give you  
**[0:31:35-0:31:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:31:35):**  a good idea of the challenges, the blessings and just the living situation of people who've  
**[0:31:42-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:31:42):**  adopted this as their lifestyle and have been doing it either for short or long periods  
**[0:31:45-0:31:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:31:45):**  of time.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:31:46):**  And I think it gives great perspective even though it's focused on a microcosm of the  
**[0:31:51-0:32:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:31:51):**  Cape Valley, also of the larger trends in agriculture in modern times right now and  
**[0:32:00-0:32:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:32:00):**  it's a fantastic perspective and look at those things.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:32:03):**  So thanks for writing that book and can you tell my listeners how they can get in contact  
**[0:32:07-0:32:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:32:07):**  with you and find the book for themselves?  
**[0:32:11-0:32:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:32:11):**  Yeah thanks so much Oliver.

**[0:32:51-0:32:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:32:51):**  Yeah thanks Oliver.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:32:53):**  I've really enjoyed listening to your podcasts and looking at your blogs and thanks a lot  
**[0:32:59-0:33:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:32:59):**  for having me.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:33:00):**  It is my pleasure.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:33:01):**  Take care.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:33:02):**  Bye.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:33:03):**  So before we wrap up this show for the week I've got some exciting news about the upcoming  
**[0:33:08-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:33:08):**  months and I'm joined here now with my good friend and founder of Atitlan Organics, Shad  
**[0:33:13-0:33:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:33:13):**  Goodsy.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:33:14):**  Hey buddy what's new?  
**[0:33:15-0:33:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:33:15):**  Oh man so much is happening.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:33:18):**  First off though I just want to say thanks for having me man.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:33:21):**  I really love your podcast and I actually had a great time doing that interview back  
**[0:33:25-0:33:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:33:25):**  in one of the earlier episodes.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:33:27):**  Anyway probably what's most exciting is our new collaboration between Atitlan Organics  
**[0:33:32-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:33:32):**  and Abundant Edge.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:33:33):**  As you know we've been offering permaculture design courses for over six years now and  
**[0:33:38-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:33:38):**  they really have become a staple here in Lake Atitlan.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:33:41):**  In particular though the intro to permaculture course is just an amazing way for travelers,  
**[0:33:47-0:33:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:33:47):**  gardeners, architects, basically anyone to fully immerse themselves in this new paradigm  
**[0:33:52-0:33:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:33:52):**  of permaculture design.  
**[0:33:54-0:34:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:33:54):**  Like honestly you can't take this course and still see the world the same way afterward.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:34:00):**  Yeah that's for sure.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:34:01):**  It's life changing.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:34:02):**  But like I said what I'm most excited about is that now thanks to our collaboration we're  
**[0:34:07-0:34:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:34:07):**  going to be able to offer your natural building course immediately after every one of our  
**[0:34:12-0:34:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:34:12):**  intro to permaculture courses.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:34:15):**  Basically this two week offering is like possibly the most complete package that I know of available  
**[0:34:21-0:34:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:34:21):**  anywhere.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:34:22):**  Basically with these two courses alone I think that someone should have everything they need  
**[0:34:27-0:34:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:34:27):**  to start their own regenerative project or just their own regenerative lifestyle.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:34:32):**  That's what I'm excited about man.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:34:34):**  But yeah what about you?  
**[0:34:35-0:34:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:34:35):**  What's going on?  
**[0:34:36-0:34:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:34:36):**  Man well you know already that me and the Abundant Edge team are gearing up for a big  
**[0:34:40-0:34:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:34:40):**  season as well.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:34:41):**  I mean starting in November we'll be breaking ground on a regenerative farming demonstration  
**[0:34:46-0:34:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:34:46):**  site which is of course right down the hill from your farm.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:34:50):**  We'll be building animal pens, a classroom, outdoor kitchens and lounge areas connected  
**[0:34:55-0:34:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:34:55):**  to houses and it's all going to be made out of natural materials.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:34:58):**  I mean the site is going to serve as a demonstration farm for perennial and regenerative farming  
**[0:35:03-0:35:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:35:03):**  methods for years and years to come.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:35:06):**  And we'll even be offering courses and internship opportunities to people who want to learn  
**[0:35:10-0:35:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:35:10):**  for themselves about how to build with natural materials and set up their own farms.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:35:15):**  Heck yeah that sounds amazing man.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:35:18):**  And honestly this is just about the best place in the world to learn all these things too.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:35:22):**  I mean this little town of Sununah in the gorgeous tropical mountains of Guatemala like  
**[0:35:27-0:35:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:35:27):**  right here on the shores of Lake Atitlan.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:35:28):**  It's one of the most beautiful places in the world.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:35:31):**  On top of that you have this traditional indigenous Mayan culture that's still rich and alive.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:35:37):**  And probably my favorite part is that we have this world international community of alternative  
**[0:35:43-0:35:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:35:43):**  people that are open to new ideas and really putting things into practice.  
**[0:35:47-0:35:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:35:47):**  I mean within walking distance of the bamboo guest house you've got loads of things going  
**[0:35:52-0:35:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:35:52):**  on.  
**[0:35:53-0:35:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:35:53):**  We've got the projects that we've already talked about.  
**[0:35:54-0:35:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:35:54):**  But you also have yoga retreat centers.  
**[0:35:56-0:36:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:35:56):**  You have Charlie Rendell's natural bamboo building school.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:36:00):**  You have Love Probiotics.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:36:01):**  You have Fungi Academy.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:36:03):**  And honestly loads more alternative blow your mind type stuff.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:36:07):**  I honestly just feel like this is where it's all happening.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:36:10):**  Yeah it really does.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:36:11):**  And I want to get as many people as possible in on these projects but we've got to make  
**[0:36:15-0:36:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:36:15):**  sure that they've got the skills first.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:36:17):**  So what do you say?  
**[0:36:18-0:36:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:36:18):**  Let's offer a big discount to those who sign up for both courses.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:36:21):**  I mean all food and lodging and the amazing bamboo guest house is already included in  
**[0:36:26-0:36:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:36:26):**  the tuition.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:36:27):**  So this will be like the best deal that we've ever offered.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:36:30):**  That's a great idea.  
**[0:36:31-0:36:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:36:31):**  Because I mean people can still take just one course if that's what they're into or  
**[0:36:34-0:36:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:36:34):**  if they can't make the full two weeks.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:36:36):**  But this will actually make the two courses more accessible to even a wider audience of  
**[0:36:41-0:36:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:36:41):**  people.  
**[0:36:42-0:36:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:36:42):**  That way more people can get the knowledge that they need to get started doing what they  
**[0:36:46-0:36:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:36:46):**  want to do.  
**[0:36:48-0:36:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:36:48):**  So hey to all of you listening out there we really want passionate and driven people like  
**[0:36:52-0:36:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:36:52):**  you to come and be a part of the community and the ecosystem that we're building out  
**[0:36:55-0:36:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:36:55):**  here.  
**[0:36:56-0:37:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:36:56):**  So if you're ready to take the next step and really dive in there's no better time to invest  
**[0:37:00-0:37:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:37:00):**  in yourself by joining us on this journey to a regenerative future.

**[0:37:09-0:37:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:37:09):**  For sure.

**[0:37:36-0:37:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:37:36):**  who would jump at the chance to get involved in this positive, regenerative, and truly  
**[0:37:41-0:37:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:37:41):**  life changing projects.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-elvira-dibrigit/#t=0:37:43):**  So this is Oliver Gaucher and Shad Goodsy inviting you to come and be a part of the

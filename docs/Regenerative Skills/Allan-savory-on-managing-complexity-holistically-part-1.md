### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 19 Nov 2021 12:07:37)
**[0:00:00-0:00:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:00:00):**  This is Regenerative Skills, the podcast helping you to learn the skills and solutions to create  
**[0:00:08-0:00:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:00:08):**  an abundant and connected future.  
**[0:00:10-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:00:10):**  I'm your host, Oliver Gautier.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:00:14):**  I am once again honored to be representing my friends at New Society Publishers, the  
**[0:00:19-0:00:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:00:19):**  book publishers that were a big inspiration to me even before I started working with ecologies  
**[0:00:24-0:00:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:00:24):**  and natural buildings and way before podcasting.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:00:28):**  Their titles like The Natural Plaster Book and Timber Framing for the Rest of Us really  
**[0:00:32-0:00:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:00:32):**  made me believe that I could build my own home, which I eventually did.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:00:37):**  And later volumes like Ecopreneuring, Unlearn Rewild, and Building Community have offered  
**[0:00:42-0:00:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:00:42):**  tons of inspiration and even helped to shape my world view.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:00:45):**  Whether you're looking for practical tips on growing and preserving food, exploring  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:00:49):**  complex challenges in your own life, or sometimes just searching for hope and inspiration in  
**[0:00:54-0:00:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:00:54):**  a crazy world where you don't feel like you fit in, you'll find exactly what you're  
**[0:00:58-0:01:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:00:58):**  looking for and more at newsociety.com.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:01:04):**  So yeah, this interview has been on my podcasting bucket list for a long time.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:01:10):**  Like so many others, I have been intrigued by Alan's work since I saw his iconic TED  
**[0:01:14-0:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:01:14):**  talk a few years back.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:01:16):**  Now the promise of the ability to restore grassland ecologies through careful managed  
**[0:01:21-0:01:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:01:21):**  grazing made so much sense to me.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:01:24):**  Alan adeptly explained how he learned how to mimic the migration patterns of herd animals  
**[0:01:28-0:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:01:28):**  on the plains of the African savannah by bunching them together to imitate predator pressure,  
**[0:01:34-0:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:01:34):**  and then to move them through paddocks to allow the land to rest and recover in between  
**[0:01:38-0:01:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:01:38):**  impact cycles.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:01:40):**  Now through careful observation, he learned how to time these grazing and rest cycles  
**[0:01:44-0:01:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:01:44):**  in such a way that the perennial grasses could grow larger than ever saw possible, and so  
**[0:01:49-0:01:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:01:49):**  many other healthy functions of the land were restored in turn.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:01:54):**  That seems so simple and yet has marked a revolution in ranching and livestock management  
**[0:01:59-0:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:01:59):**  around the world, giving rise to the prominence of holistic management through the Savory  
**[0:02:03-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:02:03):**  Institute and an ever expanding network of savory hubs around the world.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:02:09):**  Now I myself dabbled in the core teachings which are based around working with whole  
**[0:02:13-0:02:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:02:13):**  systems rather than reductionist scientific methods, and defining one's own holistic  
**[0:02:18-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:02:18):**  context within the whole under management.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:02:22):**  Now from there you can learn to make decisions based on the quality of life you desire for  
**[0:02:25-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:02:25):**  yourself and for those you love, and then assess the resources that you need to produce  
**[0:02:30-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:02:30):**  or acquire to maintain that quality of life indefinitely.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:02:34):**  I began to see these principles pop up in other books I was reading, and Alan's teachings  
**[0:02:39-0:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:02:39):**  were quoted in nearly all of the courses on regenerative agriculture that I came across.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:02:44):**  Many of my mentors have cited this framework as the foundation on which they design farms  
**[0:02:49-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:02:49):**  and manage ecologies as well.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:02:51):**  The pieces just kept coming together.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:02:54):**  Now recently I finally committed and enrolled in the Holistic Management Accredited Professional  
**[0:02:59-0:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:02:59):**  course offered by 3LM, which is the savory hub in the UK, and which is responsible for  
**[0:03:04-0:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:03:04):**  training many of the other managers and trainers that I've connected with around Europe.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:03:09):**  Now all of this led me to play hooky on my weekly online training and finally get to  
**[0:03:13-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:03:13):**  speak with the man himself.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:03:16):**  And to be honest, this whole preamble was to try and explain why I sound so nervous  
**[0:03:21-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:03:21):**  on this interview.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:03:23):**  And of course, just as Murphy's Law would have it, when I finally got Alan on the call,  
**[0:03:27-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:03:27):**  my connection began to fail me.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:03:29):**  So with the combination of me sounding much like I did back on the early sessions of this  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:03:34):**  show and some annoying glitchy audio sound issues, which I promised that I mostly cleaned  
**[0:03:39-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:03:39):**  up in the post-production, I invite you to have a listen to the first of a two-part call  
**[0:03:45-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:03:45):**  with Alan Savory, in which we explore some of the insights that he has gained from decades  
**[0:03:49-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:03:49):**  of teaching and developing this framework all around the world.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:03:53):**  Now in this first half, we start by talking about what Alan is working on these days and  
**[0:03:58-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:03:58):**  what he still sees as the unfinished business of a very long career.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:04:02):**  We dissect some of the more challenging concepts of holistic management, both to grasp and  
**[0:04:07-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:04:07):**  to teach, and Alan uses some of my inept use of language to illustrate some common misunderstandings  
**[0:04:13-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:04:13):**  that arise with newcomers like myself.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:04:16):**  Now if you're interested in getting a chance to hear Alan Savory speak live and ask him  
**[0:04:21-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:04:21):**  some questions of your own, there are still a few spots open to register for the expert  
**[0:04:26-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:04:26):**  panel call that I'm hosting with him and Rudolf Buhler of the Besch Farmers Association  
**[0:04:31-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:04:31):**  this upcoming Wednesday at 8 PM Central European Time.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:04:35):**  It's free to register and I'll be posting the link on the Discord channel, which you  
**[0:04:38-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:04:38):**  can access through our website or our Instagram page.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:04:42):**  And with all of that out of the way, I will now hand things over to Alan Savory.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:04:47):**  I'm sure people, you're used to getting asked all the time about the holistic management  
**[0:04:52-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:04:52):**  program and such, but I'm really curious as to what it is you're working on specifically  
**[0:04:57-0:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:04:57):**  now.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:04:58):**  What are some of the projects and the things that really have you motivated at the moment?  
**[0:05:02-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:05:02):**  Well, the one thing that's got me motivated is I'm more worried about the future for young  
**[0:05:11-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:05:11):**  people than I've ever been in my life.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:05:14):**  I've got to be realistic.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:05:16):**  I'm 86 now and I've been running on spare parts and batteries and I've been shot twice  
**[0:05:23-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:05:23):**  and had polio and malaria and many things.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:05:26):**  And so with the best will in the world, in four years time, I'll be 90.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:05:32):**  I'm slowing down.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:05:34):**  And so I'm trying to think, what can I do in my remaining years, you know, with all  
**[0:05:40-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:05:40):**  the experience I have of 65 years of developing this concept that I believe is so vital for  
**[0:05:49-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:05:49):**  the future of humanity, what can I do?  
**[0:05:51-0:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:05:51):**  There's so many good people in the movement now, the regenerative movement centered as  
**[0:05:59-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:05:59):**  it has to be on holistic management.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:06:01):**  Time will be regenerative unless we address the root cause of the problem, which is reductionist  
**[0:06:07-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:06:07):**  management, which no scientist could argue.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:06:11):**  And there's so many good people and that's expanding so fast under the leadership of  
**[0:06:16-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:06:16):**  younger people now that I'm not needed there.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:06:19):**  I'm like an old horse can be put out to pasture.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:06:23):**  So I'm trying to think, well, what can I do?  
**[0:06:27-0:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:06:27):**  And I really believe that everything we're doing and the wonderful progress that people  
**[0:06:31-0:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:06:31):**  are making and every day I'm seeing better, all the billions of people out there, how  
**[0:06:38-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:06:38):**  many would even watch this or listen to this?  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:06:41):**  It's fine, fine, fine number.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:06:45):**  It's almost meaningless.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:06:47):**  So we know that the only way change occurs is as you're doing it by getting knowledge  
**[0:06:53-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:06:53):**  out to people like this change in a nearly really new direction.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:06:58):**  This is how it occurs.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:07:00):**  And if I look at just the grazing aspects of my work, just discovering that we cannot  
**[0:07:06-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:07:06):**  solve climate change without livestock, just discovering that it has gone so many directions,  
**[0:07:13-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:07:13):**  been so diluted that most of what's been called regenerative grazing today will just lead  
**[0:07:19-0:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:07:19):**  to desertification and climate change.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:07:22):**  People are just diluting it.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:07:24):**  And I keep using the example of language.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:07:29):**  The English and the Dutch language got to South Africa, Southern tip of Africa about  
**[0:07:34-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:07:34):**  the same time, 300 years ago, whenever it was.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:07:39):**  And today English is understandable all over the world.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:07:45):**  But the Dutch in South Africa is only understandable in South Africa.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:07:50):**  Why is that?  
**[0:07:52-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:07:52):**  The one group of people around the world kept in touch through London, through trade, and  
**[0:07:58-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:07:58):**  kept the language developing until it has the biggest vocabulary of any language, I  
**[0:08:04-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:08:04):**  believe now.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:08:05):**  Whereas the Dutch in South Africa just talked to themselves and it diluted and diluted to  
**[0:08:13-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:08:13):**  where it's not even intelligible to a Dutchman today in Poland.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:08:19):**  So we've got that center to try to keep the knowledge coordinated and hopefully prevent  
**[0:08:26-0:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:08:26):**  too much dilution.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:08:28):**  So that like using the flying example, for thousands of years, we couldn't fly.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:08:34):**  But once the Wright brothers learned how, within 70 years, we were on the moon, because  
**[0:08:41-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:08:41):**  human creativity could be released.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:08:44):**  And people could develop as they did thousands of models of planes, of rockets and things.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:08:49):**  But all the ones that diluted the principle of flight, any of those principles, they crashed  
**[0:08:56-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:08:56):**  quickly and didn't dilute the knowledge.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:09:00):**  And with holistic management, we discovered how to practice it in 1983 was about where  
**[0:09:08-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:09:08):**  I would put the breakthrough when we finally knew that we got it, what was causing the  
**[0:09:13-0:09:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:09:13):**  problem and how to correct it.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:09:16):**  And we could find no further flaws, logic or science in it.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:09:21):**  We had 2000 scientists working with me.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:09:24):**  When we reached that point, that was exciting.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:09:29):**  But instead of being on the moon now, or halfway there, we've just in this dispersed knowledge,  
**[0:09:37-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:09:37):**  and I'm looking at people excited and training.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:09:41):**  And it's wonderful, but they're excited and training on stuff I was doing 60 years ago.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:09:47):**  Only now is to catch on with some of that.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:09:51):**  We need to move faster.  
**[0:09:54-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:09:54):**  And that's where my mind is gone.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:09:57):**  How can we take this wonderful effort of everybody, but we know that because of incremental change  
**[0:10:04-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:10:04):**  and dilution in many languages and we have around the world.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:10:10):**  We know it's going to get diluted and more and more controversy and so on as we see going  
**[0:10:17-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:10:17):**  on more and more ignorant criticism of what it's not.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:10:21):**  And all of that, till it leads to management at large scale changing.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:10:28):**  We know from science and from history, from the social studies, from history, from system  
**[0:10:34-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:10:34):**  science, from the work of people, how knowledge diffuses through society.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:10:43):**  We know that that means 100 to 200 years from now, it'll be general application or could  
**[0:10:50-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:10:50):**  be.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:10:52):**  And I don't think your generation and below have got that time.  
**[0:10:56-0:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:10:56):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:10:58):**  That's a depressing problem, isn't it?  
**[0:11:00-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:11:00):**  And I can actually attest to some of the things you're talking about.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:11:02):**  I mean, for years, I have been hearing about parts of holistic management and various specific  
**[0:11:08-0:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:11:08):**  applications that I have tried out in some of the contexts of my own projects and client  
**[0:11:14-0:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:11:14):**  projects as well.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:11:16):**  And more and more, I started to realize that this isn't something that you can take and  
**[0:11:20-0:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:11:20):**  pick little parts of and apply in isolation, but this is a mindset and a way of managing  
**[0:11:27-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:11:27):**  complexity that only works when the entire system or the framework is used together.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:11:35):**  And that's part of why I'm on this journey to learn this thing thoroughly now.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:11:40):**  But I also understand what you're saying and see this continuing to be applied in bits  
**[0:11:45-0:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:11:45):**  and pieces without connecting the framework that's required to monitor decisions and make  
**[0:11:53-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:11:53):**  small changes and correct course along the way rather than just saying, OK, we're going  
**[0:11:57-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:11:57):**  to try this out.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:11:58):**  And if it doesn't work, it means holistic management doesn't work.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:12:01):**  I'm sure you must be very tired of saying that criticism.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:12:04):**  Oh, I just saw that.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:12:06):**  Where do you see an opportunity to fix that?  
**[0:12:08-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:12:08):**  How does the message get through that this is not a recipe, but it's a way of making  
**[0:12:14-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:12:14):**  your own decisions and using your own observations to make calculated choices and monitor them?  
**[0:12:21-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:12:21):**  Let me make two points on what you've said.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:12:25):**  And I'm trying to help everybody who listens to us to learn first, we think in words.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:12:33):**  So I'm not I'm doing this as a teaching example, not to belittle you or pick on you, but you  
**[0:12:39-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:12:39):**  can't apply it.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:12:42):**  You see, so right there, I know you're having a little difficulty understanding holistic  
**[0:12:47-0:12:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:12:47):**  management, because if you were my son and I was paying for you to have lessons in music  
**[0:12:55-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:12:55):**  and you came home and said, I'm learning to apply the violin, I'd get very worried.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:13:02):**  That's a good example.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:13:05):**  You cannot apply holistic management.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:13:08):**  So if we talk in words, then our and get the words right, then our thinking follows.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:13:15):**  You can only practice this 100% practice.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:13:18):**  There is no theory.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:13:20):**  If this theory was given by Smuts, and people constantly talk about checking my theory or  
**[0:13:25-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:13:25):**  testing, I don't have a theory.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:13:29):**  There's just a practice that I've developed.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:13:34):**  And it's like if we, if nobody listening to us had ever had a bicycle or seen a bicycle,  
**[0:13:41-0:13:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:13:41):**  and I had developed a bicycle, riding that is 100% practical.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:13:45):**  It's not theoretical.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:13:47):**  Okay.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:13:48):**  And if I was describing to you what a bicycle is, and how to ride it, the more I described,  
**[0:13:54-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:13:54):**  the more confusing it would get.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:13:56):**  And the more you question me, and we debated it, the more confusing it would get.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:14:01):**  But if we had a bicycle with us, and you were with me, within an hour, you'd be riding it,  
**[0:14:06-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:14:06):**  because it's practical.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:14:07):**  And it's exactly the same, the more people talk about what it is, and explain it, the  
**[0:14:14-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:14:14):**  more confusing it gets.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:14:16):**  If we get people together, they do it.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:14:20):**  The universal reaction is, Oh, God, this is just so simple.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:14:25):**  This is just common sense.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:14:27):**  So I find everybody that's learning is making it too complicated.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:14:33):**  And it comes with that application of the language, right, that difference between the  
**[0:14:39-0:14:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:14:39):**  wording that you just explained right now, and the semantics that often get put on top  
**[0:14:43-0:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:14:43):**  of what you're saying is a very practical, a very simple concept.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:14:48):**  But in the complication of explaining it, without having a demonstration to offer, that's  
**[0:14:56-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:14:56):**  where a lot of the confusion comes in.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:14:58):**  Well, it comes in, like, for example, the moment people use HM, or refer to it as though  
**[0:15:08-0:15:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:15:08):**  it's some entity, the person you know, is in the framework of some sort of management  
**[0:15:14-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:15:14):**  system that you can apply, you see, you can apply an accounting system, you can apply  
**[0:15:19-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:15:19):**  an inventory control system in your business, but you can't run, apply a business system,  
**[0:15:26-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:15:26):**  you run your business on continuous process of planning, monitoring and control happening.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:15:33):**  And if we take the language we're using, if you were saying to me, I'm thinking of applying  
**[0:15:47-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:15:47):**  management in my life, I would say, what the hell's wrong with you?  
**[0:15:52-0:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:15:52):**  Do you see?  
**[0:15:54-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:15:54):**  Yeah.  
**[0:15:55-0:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:15:55):**  And if you say you're thinking of using or applying holistic management, you haven't  
**[0:16:01-0:16:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:16:01):**  understood it.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:16:02):**  You said you can manage your life.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:16:06):**  So you can manage your life holistically, or you can manage your life in the usual,  
**[0:16:11-0:16:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:16:11):**  universal reductionist way that all humans do.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:16:14):**  It's just those two choices.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:16:16):**  Simple.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:16:17):**  Now, the other thing, when people talk about theories, when we were putting in those early  
**[0:16:23-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:16:23):**  80s, when far sighted bureaucrats really in the soil conservation service of the United  
**[0:16:30-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:16:30):**  States, they knew what I was doing, they'd come and talk to me about it, asked if I would  
**[0:16:35-0:16:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:16:35):**  provide training, and I agreed to do so provided we opened it to everybody in the universities,  
**[0:16:41-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:16:41):**  World Bank, etc.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:16:43):**  So we put together a interagency committee that worked with me.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:16:49):**  And I said, I want to go home, so it's, you know, I don't even want to build up a business  
**[0:16:55-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:16:55):**  or anything.  
**[0:16:56-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:16:56):**  So they ran it all.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:16:57):**  I just did the training and teaching.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:17:00):**  And over two years, we put 2000 professors, others, academics, scientists, land managers  
**[0:17:07-0:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:17:07):**  in forestry, wildlife, soil conservation service, all the agricultural universities through  
**[0:17:15-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:17:15):**  training.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:17:16):**  So it was an immense effort that's never been done before, of trying to see if we could  
**[0:17:22-0:17:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:17:22):**  break through with how to deal with desertification with this framework I was developing.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:17:27):**  Now that's when with the help of these thousands of people, we finally broke through.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:17:33):**  Now, we always had strong critics, there were always a few in the group who just couldn't  
**[0:17:40-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:17:40):**  get it and became very angry, they would react with anger.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:17:44):**  It was clearly it was offensive to their authority.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:17:47):**  They were Professor so-and-so, Dr. so-and-so.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:17:51):**  And this, they were saying it's wrong by authority.  
**[0:17:54-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:17:54):**  But proof by authority is what we used in the times of Galileo, Copernicus, that's not  
**[0:18:01-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:18:01):**  science.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:18:02):**  And so others in the groups would say, well, let's do what we can, default the science.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:18:07):**  And we would spend one hour of every day, first hour was spent on trying to find some  
**[0:18:12-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:18:12):**  flaw in the logic, the science, anything else.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:18:15):**  And we just couldn't, we gave up in frustration.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:18:19):**  And then with one really interesting, one of them said, why don't we test this as a  
**[0:18:24-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:18:24):**  hypothesis?  
**[0:18:25-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:18:25):**  So I said, that's a good idea.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:18:28):**  Let's try that.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:18:29):**  So what we did was we said, look, managing holistically isn't a hypothesis.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:18:34):**  But that is the scientific method is to test something as though it was, let's assume it  
**[0:18:39-0:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:18:39):**  was.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:18:40):**  So do you all, managing holistically means they all understood.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:18:45):**  And I said, all right, let's treat that as though it was a theory or hypothesis.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:18:50):**  And we broke up into groups, so we broke up into small groups, six to eight people to  
**[0:18:56-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:18:56):**  a table.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:18:57):**  And I said, you've got unlimited time.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:19:00):**  Now try to find some way, theoretically, to cause this to fail, cause this way of management  
**[0:19:06-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:19:06):**  to fail.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:19:07):**  And so that was the task.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:19:09):**  And time was unlimited, and they went at it, trying to because I said, if we can cause  
**[0:19:13-0:19:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:19:13):**  this to fail, in theory, we're going to run into trouble in practice.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:19:19):**  And I can tell you what the results were of those exercises.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:19:24):**  They would give up in total frustration.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:19:26):**  And so damn it, you can't even cause us to fail in theory.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:19:29):**  And I said, right, now let's get on with it.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:19:31):**  But some, a few would still just doggedly keep on, couldn't accept it.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:19:38):**  Now that's not because of the bad people.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:19:41):**  What we've subsequently learned is just the difficulty of people to change paradigm, particularly  
**[0:19:49-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:19:49):**  if you've pinned your self-esteem to your knowledge or your academic position.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:19:57):**  Well that leads perfectly to one of the things that I was interested in understanding is  
**[0:20:01-0:20:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:20:01):**  with so many decades of teaching this around the world, what remains one of the more difficult  
**[0:20:07-0:20:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:20:07):**  concepts or aspects of this management practice to convey or that you find people have the  
**[0:20:14-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:20:14):**  most difficulty getting a grasp on?  
**[0:20:18-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:20:18):**  It's just, I would say probably the utter simplicity, because even people who've trained  
**[0:20:24-0:20:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:20:24):**  with me and gone on and done very, very well, if I revisit them and with them, or I'm listening  
**[0:20:30-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:20:30):**  to them talking to people or coaching people, time and again, I find they're making it too  
**[0:20:34-0:20:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:20:34):**  complicated.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:20:37):**  It's interesting.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:20:38):**  I would often tell the story.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:20:39):**  I was once stranded in an airport in Mexico City, traffic, weather, something held everything  
**[0:20:46-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:20:46):**  up.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:20:47):**  And I ended up sitting in a crowded restaurant with a Brazilian civil engineer.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:20:52):**  He turned out to be, and we talked about what he did.  
**[0:20:55-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:20:55):**  And my father had been a civil engineer and I was very fascinated.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:20:59):**  He was involved in building the new capital.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:21:03):**  And then he asked what I did and I said, I dread that question.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:21:07):**  I don't know how to answer it really.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:21:09):**  And I said, I'm working on really what I think is the biggest problem ever that's faced to  
**[0:21:14-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:21:14):**  humans, which is how to manage complexity in effect.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:21:19):**  And this was in the 1980s.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:21:22):**  And he said, how are you doing?  
**[0:21:24-0:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:21:24):**  And I said, well, actually, we're doing well.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:21:27):**  We're getting some amazing progress.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:21:29):**  We're really making some progress.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:21:32):**  And he floored me.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:21:33):**  He just looked at me and said, it must be very simple.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:21:37):**  And he said, it's an insurmountable problem.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:21:41):**  We usually find the answer is extremely simple.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:21:44):**  And that's the biggest difficulty I think I have is people making it complicated.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:21:49):**  That does make a lot of sense.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:21:50):**  There is that tendency, especially in the academic world and for people who are trying  
**[0:21:54-0:21:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:21:54):**  to prove theories or practices that it needs to be dissected and pulled apart, which is  
**[0:21:59-0:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:21:59):**  kind of the antithesis to the concept of looking at things as wholes and managing in that way.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:22:05):**  Since you have pioneered this way of thinking and managing and have, I assume, been applying  
**[0:22:11-0:22:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:22:11):**  it quite a lot to your own life and your own work for that same amount of time.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:22:15):**  Go ahead.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:22:16):**  Remember, I said you can't apply it.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:22:19):**  Yes.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:22:20):**  It's going to take me a while to get through that wording, like you said.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:22:23):**  Thank you for the reminder.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:22:26):**  In your own life, managing things this way and your work, are there any aspects of this  
**[0:22:32-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:22:32):**  that you still struggle to work into your management decisions or the monitoring aspect  
**[0:22:38-0:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:22:38):**  or the observations or any of these?  
**[0:22:41-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:22:41):**  Since you, I guess, started to clarify a little bit, that analogy with the violin made a lot  
**[0:22:46-0:22:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:22:46):**  of sense to me.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:22:47):**  This is a practice, which in concept means that you're working towards a state of mastery.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:22:53):**  And mastery is not something that you fully achieve, it's something that you work towards,  
**[0:22:57-0:22:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:22:57):**  I assume, in this case.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:22:59):**  Where do you feel you are in that process?  
**[0:23:02-0:23:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:23:02):**  Well, you know, if you're managing your life or managing anything, you're going to be in  
**[0:23:07-0:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:23:07):**  a constantly changing circumstance because we only manage three things.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:23:14):**  Humans only manage three things.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:23:16):**  We manage our lives, our organizations, our families, our communities.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:23:20):**  In other words, we manage humans, we manage nature or the environment, and we manage economy.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:23:27):**  There's nothing else we manage.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:23:29):**  We produce millions of things.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:23:32):**  We produce food, beef, corn, grain, grapes, wine.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:23:36):**  We produce cell phones, bombs, orchestras, music, museums, planes, trains, you know,  
**[0:23:44-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:23:44):**  all the things around me.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:23:47):**  These we produce.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:23:49):**  So the problem isn't with the things we produce because those are not complex.  
**[0:23:54-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:23:54):**  They stop if you stop producing them, you stop producing food, it stops.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:23:58):**  They do what they intended to do.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:24:00):**  Food feeds you, watch tells the time, a computer computes.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:24:04):**  They're not complex.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:24:06):**  And the problem lies in humans, our inability to manage complexity.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:24:14):**  That's what is causing climate change and everything else.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:24:17):**  So what things are we managing?  
**[0:24:21-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:24:21):**  And that's only the three things I said.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:24:23):**  We're managing humans, nature, environment, and economy.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:24:28):**  And you can't manage those independent of each other.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:24:31):**  You can produce food or bombs, but you can't manage humans and economy that indivisibly  
**[0:24:39-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:24:39):**  from nature as COVID has taught us.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:24:41):**  I mean, a little virus taught the whole damn world that humans, human health, economy,  
**[0:24:47-0:24:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:24:47):**  nature are one.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:24:49):**  Okay, so they can only be managed one.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:24:52):**  Now, you can take any individual farmer listening to us with say, the farmer's family, and they  
**[0:24:58-0:25:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:24:58):**  can think, oh, we're in charge of our lives, we can manage our lives holistically.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:25:02):**  No, they can't.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:25:03):**  They can only do it to a certain point.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:25:06):**  So you and I can choose to change the light bulbs or ride a bicycle to work or whatever,  
**[0:25:12-0:25:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:25:12):**  and begin to manage our lives holistically, but we're operating within a local economy.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:25:19):**  And that is being manipulated and managed by global financiers driving environmental  
**[0:25:25-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:25:25):**  destruction.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:25:26):**  So no matter how perfectly we manage our lives, we're doomed.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:25:32):**  Now we can manage the nature on our farm as much as we can, but it's so tied to everything  
**[0:25:38-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:25:38):**  around us in the atmosphere and everything else, that again, it's not indivisible.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:25:43):**  So as individuals, we can only do our best, and I do my best.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:25:49):**  But I can get terribly depressed, just totally futile because people around me aren't all  
**[0:25:58-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:25:58):**  downstream.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:26:01):**  And so what we've got to do, and that's what worries me, and why I said if we do wonderfully  
**[0:26:06-0:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:26:06):**  well in showing people what can be done, getting people to understand the utter simplicity  
**[0:26:12-0:26:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:26:12):**  of managing holistically, we know it'll take one to 200 years.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:26:16):**  And right now you've got global desertification, the desertification of the Iberian Peninsula,  
**[0:26:22-0:26:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:26:22):**  which is bad.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:26:24):**  You've got that.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:26:25):**  You've got mega fires developing and climate change spiraling, feeding on one another,  
**[0:26:33-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:26:33):**  spiraling out of control.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:26:35):**  We can do something about that.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:26:38):**  And we as individuals do anything but incrementally change, try to change others around us, try  
**[0:26:47-0:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:26:47):**  to change our communities, try to expand using the network and everything else.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:26:52):**  While we're doing that, there are other people doing the opposite and expanding mainstream  
**[0:26:57-0:27:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:26:57):**  agriculture, mainstream use of fossil fuels, whatever.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:27:00):**  And the conflict just continues and continues until a century or two from now, people might  
**[0:27:06-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:27:06):**  be managing holistically.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:27:09):**  So that, coming back to your early question, what am I trying to do?  
**[0:27:14-0:27:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:27:14):**  I'm just thinking, well, in the remaining four or five years actively of my life, the  
**[0:27:20-0:27:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:27:20):**  best I can do is to try to find a way of bringing the Berlin Wall down suddenly, a way of getting  
**[0:27:30-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:27:30):**  sudden change.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:27:32):**  And I believe we could do that if we could just get one world leader with the statesmanship  
**[0:27:40-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:27:40):**  and the courage to say, let's do it at scale.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:27:44):**  Because you said it earlier, we can't do bits and pieces.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:27:49):**  So we need one world leader.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:27:51):**  That means one political leader.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:27:53):**  I think it'll have to be of a small country in deep trouble or dictatorial.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:27:58):**  It doesn't matter whether it's a dictatorship or a democracy, makes no difference at all,  
**[0:28:03-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:28:03):**  because they make policies exactly the same way and get them to develop policies holistically.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:28:10):**  Because beyond us as individuals, lives or our local community, everything we manage  
**[0:28:17-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:28:17):**  at larger scale, we have to do through a human organization, an institution, a corporation,  
**[0:28:22-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:28:22):**  a church, government, a university, an environmental organization, a farming organization.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:28:30):**  That's how we operate.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:28:32):**  And so when you look at the scale of, let's call it climate change, desertification, spiraling  
**[0:28:40-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:28:40):**  out of control, we cannot tackle that as individuals, we have to do through our institutions.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:28:49):**  And that means world leaders are in the same position, they can only lead through the policies  
**[0:28:56-0:28:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:28:56):**  of these institutions.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:28:58):**  And that begins with government policies, policies of large environmental organizations,  
**[0:29:05-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:29:05):**  everything else as well, but the governments of every country developing their policies.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:29:10):**  So if we get one small country to just carry on governing as normal, take no political  
**[0:29:17-0:29:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:29:17):**  risk, there's no need to, and just concurrently say, let's develop policy holistically, and  
**[0:29:25-0:29:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:29:25):**  see if it's different.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:29:27):**  If they do that, I promise you, I'll stake my life on it.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:29:32):**  It'll be totally different, and so acceptable to everybody, that people will say, Oh, my  
**[0:29:38-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:29:38):**  God, this was so simple.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:29:42):**  That's what I'm trying to do.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:29:43):**  So I've just this morning, I just did a 13, I think it is a 14 minute talk for COP26.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:29:51):**  But I'll be talking in an obscure little sideshow on regenerative agriculture, with a couple  
**[0:29:57-0:30:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:29:57):**  of other exceptional, couple of people who are exceptional speakers.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:30:03):**  And so it'll be a very small voice, and I'll probably be talking about production, how  
**[0:30:09-0:30:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:30:09):**  do we produce?  
**[0:30:10-0:30:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:30:10):**  I won't be talking about management of complexity.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:30:13):**  So I know now without needing to be at COP26, that it'll be no better than the previous  
**[0:30:20-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:30:20):**  25.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:30:22):**  And if we have another COP100, if we reach that point, it will still be discussing the  
**[0:30:29-0:30:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:30:29):**  symptoms of our inability to manage complexity.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:30:33):**  I just wish I could find one scientist in the world who would tell me I'm wrong.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:30:37):**  Yeah, I can understand the discouragement and some of the depression that comes from  
**[0:30:42-0:30:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:30:42):**  having this perspective and just knowing that, despite all of these efforts, these Congresses,  
**[0:30:49-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:30:49):**  all the money being thrown around, we're still not having the right conversations.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:30:54):**  And maybe that's a good place to kind of turn around a little bit and switch gears.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:30:59):**  I'm interested because you have been working with people all over the world in so many  
**[0:31:03-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:31:03):**  different applications for many decades now.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:31:07):**  Can you give me a story of either an individual or project or a community that you think really  
**[0:31:13-0:31:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:31:13):**  exemplifies the full potential and the teachings of holistic management?  
**[0:31:19-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:31:19):**  Again, in the interests of simplicity, I'm just going to come down to two examples with  
**[0:31:26-0:31:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:31:26):**  you.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:31:27):**  Okay.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:31:28):**  And the ones I've used before, there was one group, I was training a group of farmers in  
**[0:31:34-0:31:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:31:34):**  America, and there was one young couple in deep financial trouble.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:31:39):**  And I really liked them.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:31:41):**  And we went through a week of training on holistic financial planning, and the decision  
**[0:31:48-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:31:48):**  framework and managing their lives and their farm holistically, and then they needed to  
**[0:31:54-0:31:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:31:54):**  go home and do it.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:31:56):**  Now, the first step in doing that at home was to develop the holistic context, that  
**[0:32:02-0:32:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:32:02):**  new concept that's not in any branch of religion or philosophy or science, it is a new concept.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:32:11):**  And anyway, they did that.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:32:12):**  And it must have been about a month later, I came into the office, said to me, Oh, my  
**[0:32:19-0:32:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:32:19):**  goodness, second jewel, it's gone.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:32:22):**  And I was really down on that.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:32:25):**  I liked them.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:32:26):**  And I thought, damn it.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:32:27):**  And I said, you know, damn it, we didn't catch them in time to save them because we've saved  
**[0:32:32-0:32:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:32:32):**  so many people who've been close to bankruptcy.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:32:35):**  And then I saw smiles on faces.  
**[0:32:37-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:32:37):**  And I said, what's going on?  
**[0:32:39-0:32:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:32:39):**  And they said, no, when they got home, and developed the holistic context, how they wanted  
**[0:32:45-0:32:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:32:45):**  their lives to be tied to their life supporting environment, the farm, the land as it'll have  
**[0:32:51-0:32:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:32:51):**  to be hundreds of years from now, and their behavior, the first thing they realized was  
**[0:32:58-0:32:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:32:58):**  they didn't.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:32:59):**  So the only honest behavior in that situation was to call the family together, find out  
**[0:33:06-0:33:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:33:06):**  if anybody in the family wants to be farming, because they were only farming because of  
**[0:33:11-0:33:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:33:11):**  the expectancy of family farm.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:33:14):**  And they found nobody in the family wanted to be farming.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:33:18):**  So the first decision was to sell the farm.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:33:21):**  That's an absolutely right decision.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:33:23):**  That's a family agriculture.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:33:27):**  If they hadn't done that, they'd have a life of struggle, divorce, whatever, now, family  
**[0:33:34-0:33:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:33:34):**  and move on.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:33:35):**  So you see the utter simplicity of it.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:33:39):**  And so many people say, well, selling the farm can't be an example.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:33:42):**  Well, it is.  
**[0:33:43-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:33:43):**  You could take, you know, I've had others where people just managing their own life.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:33:48):**  I've had one woman with a raising a single son.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:33:53):**  And she stayed with my wife and I for six months, and was then going back to Africa  
**[0:33:59-0:34:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:33:59):**  to train others.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:34:00):**  And she said to me one day, couldn't I do this in my own life?  
**[0:34:03-0:34:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:34:03):**  And I said, at our dining room table, and I said, well, what are you managing?  
**[0:34:10-0:34:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:34:10):**  Well, it's just her and her son.  
**[0:34:12-0:34:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:34:12):**  She's raising and you're employed.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:34:14):**  And yes, no one else.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:34:16):**  Okay, nobody got veto power over your decisions.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:34:18):**  It's just you.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:34:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:34:20):**  Okay.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:34:21):**  All right.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:34:22):**  And she wrote down how she wanted her life to be raising her son, and reasonably prosperous  
**[0:34:29-0:34:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:34:29):**  and so on and so forth and freedom to pursue around values and friendships and everything  
**[0:34:35-0:34:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:34:35):**  else.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:34:36):**  And I said, now you don't manage land, but everything comes from the environment or goes  
**[0:34:40-0:34:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:34:40):**  back.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:34:41):**  So how must the environment be hundreds of years from now around you clean air, clean  
**[0:34:47-0:34:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:34:47):**  water, etc.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:34:48):**  We did that.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:34:49):**  And they said, now, what about your behavior?  
**[0:34:52-0:34:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:34:52):**  You work for other people.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:34:54):**  You're reliant on other people.  
**[0:34:55-0:34:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:34:55):**  You've got to, you may want help, you may want to borrow things, whatever.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:34:59):**  So how are you going to have to behave for other people to be totally supportive of you?  
**[0:35:05-0:35:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:35:05):**  And just begin managing your life that way, making your decisions that way.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:35:10):**  There are these checks to see if your actions are in context, but don't bother with them,  
**[0:35:15-0:35:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:35:15):**  unless you've got a difficult case, or something you're really puzzled over.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:35:19):**  Otherwise, just intuitively start doing that now.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:35:22):**  And it was about 10 days or so later, she came to me and very excited and said, damn  
**[0:35:27-0:35:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:35:27):**  it, this works.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:35:28):**  And I said, what happened?  
**[0:35:31-0:35:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:35:31):**  What's your story?  
**[0:35:32-0:35:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:35:32):**  And she said, she went shopping, had a shopping list, went into the supermarket, got one of  
**[0:35:38-0:35:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:35:38):**  the trolleys, went around with her son, taking off the shopping list, putting things in the  
**[0:35:43-0:35:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:35:43):**  trolley, got to the checkout counter.  
**[0:35:46-0:35:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:35:46):**  There were seven people in front of her, so she had to wait.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:35:50):**  And while she was waiting, she was looking at her checklist and thought, why am I buying  
**[0:35:56-0:35:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:35:56):**  this?  
**[0:35:57-0:35:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:35:57):**  I need it.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:35:58):**  Why am I buying this?  
**[0:36:00-0:36:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:36:00):**  I desire it.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:36:02):**  Everything was need, desire, need, desire.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:36:04):**  And she thought, but what about the holistic context I have for my life, about raising  
**[0:36:10-0:36:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:36:10):**  my kid and educating him?  
**[0:36:12-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:36:12):**  And she said, she sheepishly went and put half the stuff back on the shelf, realized  
**[0:36:16-0:36:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:36:16):**  she didn't need it.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:36:18):**  That's somebody just beginning to manage their life holistically.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:36:22):**  So again, I gave you terribly simple examples, but I can literally go to an agricultural  
**[0:36:29-0:36:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:36:29):**  policy of a whole nation and we start dealing with it with almost that same simplicity.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:36:35):**  Just one question at a time, simply breaking it down, looking at the whole in a national  
**[0:36:42-0:36:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:36:42):**  holistic context.  
**[0:36:44-0:36:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:36:44):**  And it's amazing how harmonious it becomes, how people stop fighting, disagreeing and  
**[0:36:50-0:36:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:36:50):**  arguing because everybody at the end of the day is wanting the same sort of life.  
**[0:36:57-0:37:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:36:57):**  Thanks again so much to Alan Savory and his wife, Jodie Butterfield, who was so helpful  
**[0:37:03-0:37:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:37:03):**  in setting up this call.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:37:05):**  We'll be back next week to wrap up this interview with Alan Savory, and there we'll be going  
**[0:37:09-0:37:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:37:09):**  into some of Alan's stories of people he's come across who exemplify the mindset and  
**[0:37:13-0:37:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:37:13):**  practice of holistic management.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:37:16):**  And it's not the people who you might think.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:37:18):**  So be sure to tune in next week for the conclusion of this interview.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:37:22):**  You can find more about Alan's work through the Savory Institute at savory.global.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:37:27):**  And I also highly recommend the holistic management online training that I'm currently on with  
**[0:37:31-0:37:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:37:31):**  Sheila Cook and the 3LM Network, and you can find all of their education resources at 3LM.network.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:37:39):**  Before you go, remember that these episodes are only the beginning of the ongoing conversations  
**[0:37:43-0:37:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:37:43):**  that are happening around these topics on the Regenerative Skills Discord server.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:37:48):**  It's always free for you to join.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:37:49):**  And unlike other social media platforms, which were created with complex algorithms used  
**[0:37:54-0:37:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:37:54):**  to mine your personal data in order to sell you more junk, this channel was created for  
**[0:37:58-0:38:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:37:58):**  the free exchange of ideas, stories, and mutual support among the growing regenerative pioneers.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:38:04):**  Now over the next couple of weeks, we'll be exploring questions like, how do you currently  
**[0:38:08-0:38:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:38:08):**  manage complexity in your life?  
**[0:38:10-0:38:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:38:10):**  Do you have a system or framework that you turn to when things become overwhelming or  
**[0:38:15-0:38:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:38:15):**  do you just make things up as you go?  
**[0:38:18-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:38:18):**  I can tell you I have been on the other side, the make things up side of this for much longer  
**[0:38:23-0:38:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:38:23):**  than I have started to work with a framework, but it is very interesting and is showing  
**[0:38:28-0:38:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:38:28):**  a lot of promise in changing things positively in my life.  
**[0:38:31-0:38:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:38:31):**  So just check out the link on our Instagram account or on our homepage or the website  
**[0:38:35-0:38:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:38:35):**  at regenerativeskills.com.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:38:37):**  And that is our show for this week.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:38:38):**  Don't forget to take those little steps every day towards a regenerative future and I'll  
**[0:38:43-0:38:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=0:38:43):**  be right by your side along the way.  
**[1:11:43-1:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/alan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-1/#t=1:11:43):**  Thank you.

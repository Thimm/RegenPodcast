**[0:00:00-0:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:00:13):**  Here we dive deep into the diverse worlds of regenerative living, permaculture, and  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:00:17):**  natural building as we aspire to help you reach your highest potential for yourself,  
**[0:00:22-0:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:00:22):**  for your community, and for this beautiful planet that we share.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:00:25):**  As always, I'm your host Oliver Gaucher, and I'm thrilled to guide you through this  
**[0:00:29-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:00:29):**  week's episode, so let's jump right in!  
**[0:00:59-0:01:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:00:59):**  Alright, welcome everyone!  
**[0:01:03-0:01:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:01:03):**  Now the last time I caught up with Darren Dougherty for this podcast was back in season  
**[0:01:06-0:01:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:01:06):**  2.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:01:07):**  We talked a lot about his background and entry into ecological agriculture and how that journey  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:01:12):**  informed his development of the Rugrarian's platform and outlook on the potential of regenerative  
**[0:01:17-0:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:01:17):**  farming.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:01:18):**  Now I recently caught up with him again to investigate the new chapter of the Rugrarian's  
**[0:01:22-0:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:01:22):**  Handbook, which he and his team just released.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:01:25):**  Chapter 5, of the 10 in the book which are being released one by one in digital format  
**[0:01:30-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:01:30):**  on their website, focuses on forests and all the configurations that they come in.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:01:35):**  Since I covered many of the first few topics from this chapter and other episodes in this  
**[0:01:38-0:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:01:38):**  ongoing series on reforestation and agroforestry, I wanted to get Darren's take on specific  
**[0:01:44-0:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:01:44):**  management techniques in a commercially productive woody perennial system.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:01:48):**  This covers much more than just trees and includes plants of that classification at  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:01:52):**  nearly every level of a forest ecology such as bushes and understory crops.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:01:57):**  In this interview, we start by going over the three main techniques for managing established  
**[0:02:01-0:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:02:01):**  woody species which are pruning, thinning, and compassing, as well as the incredible  
**[0:02:06-0:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:02:06):**  amount of things that you can accomplish if you understand how to use them effectively.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:02:10):**  From there we look into harvesting from all the different major types of yields and balancing  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:02:15):**  the need to incorporate efficiency into your system while maintaining a healthy ecosystem  
**[0:02:20-0:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:02:20):**  that wants more diversity and organic patterning.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:02:23):**  We also talk about how to mitigate the initial cost of establishing tree and perennial plants  
**[0:02:27-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:02:27):**  by using upcycled and salvaged materials to start sprouting trees quickly and cheaply  
**[0:02:32-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:02:32):**  right away.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:02:33):**  By the end, Darren also touches on the importance of intervention in our landscapes to more  
**[0:02:37-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:02:37):**  effectively manage wildfires and fire-prone areas.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:02:42):**  Now before we get started, I'll just point out that the interview starts really abruptly  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:02:46):**  because I lost the beginning of the audio with the introductions and pleasantries.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:02:51):**  So try as I might after three seasons of producing this show, I'm still a complete amateur with  
**[0:02:56-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:02:56):**  audio software, so forgive me for another awkward start to this session.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:03:02):**  The good news is that it all goes smoothly after the start.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:03:05):**  If any of you want to hear more about Darren's background and journey to become the world-renowned  
**[0:03:09-0:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:03:09):**  regenerative farm designer and educator that he is, I highly recommend the first interview  
**[0:03:14-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:03:14):**  we did for this show back in season two.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:03:16):**  I've put a link to that show as well as all the other resources in the show notes for  
**[0:03:20-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:03:20):**  this episode at abundantedge.com.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:03:22):**  Now we'll jump straight into the questions with Darren.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:03:26):**  Focusing back now on the forestry systems that many people are trying to implement now,  
**[0:03:31-0:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:03:31):**  you've got a whole section in this chapter on the maintenance of forestry and agroforestry  
**[0:03:35-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:03:35):**  systems in covering pruning, thinning, and coppicing, especially in detail.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:03:40):**  Could you start by identifying the three of those and sort of the differences between  
**[0:03:44-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:03:44):**  them?  
**[0:03:45-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:03:45):**  So pruning, what did you say?  
**[0:03:47-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:03:47):**  Sorry.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:03:48):**  Pruning, thinning, and coppicing.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:03:49):**  Yeah.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:03:50):**  Well pruning, thinning, and coppicing.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:03:52):**  So pruning, well particularly when we've, this is not for every woody plant system,  
**[0:03:59-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:03:59):**  but when you're trying to obtain, well higher yields, these systems are best cultivated.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:04:09):**  So if you want to get low grade yields, then don't prune any tree that you put in and you'll  
**[0:04:17-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:04:17):**  just let the tree make its own mind up about how it will respond to the position that it's  
**[0:04:24-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:04:24):**  in.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:04:25):**  And that may not fit in with your broader goals.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:04:32):**  So if we look, we could look at particularly pruning and thinning as being interventions  
**[0:04:38-0:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:04:38):**  that we make around the physiological form of a species, of a woody plant species, such  
**[0:04:47-0:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:04:47):**  that we can take, let's say corrective actions to have that species produce to our benefit  
**[0:04:59-0:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:04:59):**  and do so more reliably given some of the constraints that there would be if we didn't  
**[0:05:03-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:05:03):**  do those interventions.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:05:05):**  So pruning is very important for woodies, for trees that are producing timber or lumber,  
**[0:05:12-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:05:12):**  so that you can create the perfect log.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:05:16):**  So if you just left trees to their own devices, you'll get one or two per hectare that produce  
**[0:05:25-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:05:25):**  the, or per acre that produce the perfect log.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:05:27):**  The rest of them will be firewood at best, or pulpwood, or some other very low end use.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:05:32):**  Whereas if you put a little bit of time and effort into that, which in itself can be recreational,  
**[0:05:36-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:05:36):**  I know a lot of farmers who have a little forestry block, and they go out at the end  
**[0:05:42-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:05:42):**  of the day or early in the morning, they go for a walk, take their loppers out there and  
**[0:05:47-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:05:47):**  go through and prune half an acre and feel really good about it and then come back another  
**[0:05:53-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:05:53):**  year later or whatever and have another go at those same trees.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:05:58):**  And that's the thing with the slower maturing systems, it's not like it's daily maintenance  
**[0:06:02-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:06:02):**  that you have to do.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:06:03):**  This can be easily integrated with a much more maintenance intensive production on other  
**[0:06:08-0:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:06:08):**  parts of the land.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:06:09):**  Well that's right.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:06:10):**  I mean, obviously, you know, if you're in the tropics and you're growing very fast growing  
**[0:06:14-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:06:14):**  species, but if it's timber species, even there, you're not there every day with the  
**[0:06:18-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:06:18):**  secateurs or the loppers.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:06:21):**  It doesn't, it's not that fast.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:06:23):**  So you know, and even, you know, we look at the syntropic agroforestry systems which have  
**[0:06:29-0:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:06:29):**  come into Vogue, thanks to the great work of Ernst Gotch as the instigator of all of  
**[0:06:36-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:06:36):**  that, but then all of his people who followed his work, I mean, even with them, I mean,  
**[0:06:42-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:06:42):**  that's probably the, in the agroforestry space, that's probably the highest intervention system  
**[0:06:51-0:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:06:51):**  that I know of, because you're not just pruning trees for form purposes, you're also pruning  
**[0:06:59-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:06:59):**  them and thinning them for their biomass contributions.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:07:06):**  Even then, I haven't seen the stats, but it's intensive, but it's not that intensive.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:07:14):**  The intensity is perhaps more on the species that the target crop species that you're growing  
**[0:07:20-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:07:20):**  in between, which you might need to go and attend to every day or every other.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:07:24):**  The woody plant systems just don't go that fast.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:07:29):**  So then you get to the, you know, if you look at fruit tree pruning and all of that, and  
**[0:07:33-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:07:33):**  a lot of people know about the importance of that, to let light through and to let a  
**[0:07:37-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:07:37):**  lot more air flow through to promote particular branches and not to have too much fruit, because  
**[0:07:45-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:07:45):**  if you allow every flower to turn into fruit, well then you'll get a lot of, in a lot of  
**[0:07:50-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:07:50):**  cases, a lot of small fruit and not a lot of bigger marketable fruit.  
**[0:07:56-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:07:56):**  So there's those sorts of things.  
**[0:07:58-0:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:07:58):**  And then you get to thinning.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:07:59):**  Thinning is the action of, particularly in timber production systems or wood production  
**[0:08:11-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:08:11):**  systems, where we're usually growing or overstocking a system with a number of trees so that they  
**[0:08:18-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:08:18):**  will purposely compete with each other for light and so grow.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:08:23):**  And so as they do so, they'll all reach for the stars, you know.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:08:27):**  And as they do, there comes a point because of their artificially high density that they'll  
**[0:08:33-0:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:08:33):**  not only start to compete for light, but start to compete for moisture and nutrients.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:08:37):**  And so if you don't get in there early enough, then that might cause a rapid slowdown in  
**[0:08:44-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:08:44):**  the growth rate of all of those involved and a change in their form.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:08:50):**  So they don't get fat anymore.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:08:51):**  They all stay quite skinny.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:08:53):**  And there's not much value in having a forest, a timber plantation of skinny trees.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:08:58):**  It's not really the objective.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:09:03):**  So we go in there and we start to thin out those ones for a start, which don't have as  
**[0:09:09-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:09:09):**  good a form as others.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:09:12):**  And that leads us to the coppicing discussion that if I do that and those species are ones,  
**[0:09:17-0:09:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:09:17):**  so a coppicing tree is one or a coppicing woody plant is one where if you cut it, it  
**[0:09:23-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:09:23):**  then grows back.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:09:25):**  Some trees and woody plants, you cut them and they don't grow back.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:09:28):**  That's the end of the tree.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:09:30):**  And we often promote coppicing species because you get something that's perpetual, that's  
**[0:09:36-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:09:36):**  always regenerating with every harvest.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:09:39):**  And that's really valuable because you don't have to replant it.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:09:44):**  If you know how much effort and energy and intervention is involved in replanting, a  
**[0:09:50-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:09:50):**  lot of time you think, well, why the hell would I do that?  
**[0:09:53-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:09:53):**  You're better off picking species that just regrow.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:09:56):**  So that all creates a whole range of different dynamics in terms of height and light access  
**[0:10:02-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:10:02):**  and form and interrelations that those individuals will have each other at different stages of  
**[0:10:10-0:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:10:10):**  their physiological state.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:10:14):**  So we manipulate that with thinning.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:10:15):**  And then with coppicing, we do what I just mentioned, and we might do that as part of  
**[0:10:23-0:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:10:23):**  the thinning regime and then promote particular individuals in a stand of trees, which we  
**[0:10:32-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:10:32):**  will never coppice because their form is so magnificent, that their physiology is so magnificent  
**[0:10:39-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:10:39):**  that they're more valuable to us for their genetics than for the wood that they have  
**[0:10:46-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:10:46):**  as a genetic contribution to the following generations or in fact, in harvesting that  
**[0:10:51-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:10:51):**  seed and then selling it to somebody, some people do.  
**[0:10:55-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:10:55):**  And then you've got everything that's in flux.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:11:00):**  And so understanding what type of outcomes you want to do, you want to produce saw logs,  
**[0:11:05-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:11:05):**  you want to produce fencing posts, you want to produce firewood, you want to produce tool  
**[0:11:10-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:11:10):**  handles, you know, all of these different things.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:11:15):**  Generally are best served by being in a in a coppice forest, if you want to have something  
**[0:11:24-0:11:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:11:24):**  that you don't want to reestablish.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:11:26):**  And then you've got the other type of coppicing, which is where, which is called pollarding.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:11:31):**  And that's where you grow a stem up a trunk up to a particular height, usually breast  
**[0:11:38-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:11:38):**  height or so, where you might cut off that tree there and then the tree will will then  
**[0:11:43-0:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:11:43):**  grow a whole set of new sprouts from that point.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:11:47):**  And that's been used, been done for centuries as a source of, you know, for willows for  
**[0:11:52-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:11:52):**  making the basketry material, but then also for making tool handles and for fodder.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:12:00):**  So you know, those, those regrowing stems are cut and then thrown to livestock as a  
**[0:12:07-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:12:07):**  and then let to recover.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:12:09):**  And then you can just do it perpetually.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:12:11):**  So you know, there's a lot of different ways that we do that, that as well.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:12:15):**  It's amazing how much power you yield with just these three kind of basic management  
**[0:12:20-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:12:20):**  techniques but how much of an influence it can have on yield on harvest on shaping of  
**[0:12:26-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:12:26):**  the landscape and the trees and the way that they interact with one another.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:12:30):**  It's really something that deserves the detail that's written about.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:12:35):**  And the economy, I mean, which I haven't dealt with in large part yet, because we haven't  
**[0:12:39-0:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:12:39):**  written that chapter.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:12:40):**  But you know, the economy of a coppice based landscape versus an industrial say pulp wood  
**[0:12:50-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:12:50):**  landscape is vastly different.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:12:54):**  For one, you only need with the pulp wood landscape, there's nobody there.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:12:59):**  It's usually replaced people with huge plantations of species which are all just going to be  
**[0:13:05-0:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:13:05):**  turned into toilet paper and paper.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:13:09):**  And very little value.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:13:12):**  You know, every these days in Brazil, earlier this year in the middle of nowhere, and there  
**[0:13:17-0:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:13:17):**  was an industrial eucalypt pulpwood plantation and there was nobody there.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:13:21):**  There was just a couple of guys on excavators with fronts on them, which just grabbed each  
**[0:13:29-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:13:29):**  tree, they had an integrated chainsaw, and then that stripped that, and then it went  
**[0:13:34-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:13:34):**  through that whole head and it stripped all of the leaves and the side branches off, and  
**[0:13:38-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:13:38):**  then docked it into two or three pieces.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:13:41):**  And then he put it in a stack.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:13:43):**  And he just did that on literally 10s of 1000s of acres versus a coppice based system.  
**[0:13:50-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:13:50):**  I'll give you an example versus say a cork plantation in rural Spain, where you've got  
**[0:14:00-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:14:00):**  say 20 cork trees, which are oak trees, every hectare.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:14:05):**  And every 13 years, there would be a mosaic of a hectare or two in those agroforestry  
**[0:14:14-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:14:14):**  systems where there'd be an old guy and a young guy working as a team, a master and  
**[0:14:21-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:14:21):**  apprentice, working on a tree together.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:14:24):**  And then, you know, this is a largely rural society, and then women coming out and supplying  
**[0:14:29-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:14:29):**  them with food and, you know, a whole cultural apparatus, which is built around that 5000  
**[0:14:38-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:14:38):**  year old agroforestry system.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:14:40):**  I'm so glad you use it as an example, because that's exactly the environment that I live  
**[0:14:45-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:14:45):**  in now.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:14:46):**  When we spoke before I was in Guatemala, and I've moved now to Catalunya.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:14:50):**  And I recently went to the Cork Museum that they have near Girona, and they've walked  
**[0:14:56-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:14:56):**  through all that exact...  
**[0:14:58-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:14:58):**  Well, you go out, I mean, I've been out with those people, and it's just the most beautiful  
**[0:15:02-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:15:02):**  thing.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:15:03):**  But then you go, I've got clients who, and I grew up in a coppicing system myself, and  
**[0:15:08-0:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:15:08):**  we'd go out and there'd be a team of us.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:15:10):**  And we'd go out and do coppicing, just to go out and clear all of the, you know, because  
**[0:15:16-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:15:16):**  when you get all the regrowth, you've got to thin those regrowth back to one.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:15:20):**  I mean, it's not a work that you are going to get too far with if there's just one person.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:15:26):**  I mean, there's a lot of stems to cut back.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:15:29):**  So you'll do that as a team.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:15:32):**  There's no team on an excavator.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:15:34):**  Right.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:15:35):**  Right?  
**[0:15:36-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:15:36):**  Where you're running around cutting trees, dropping them onto the ground.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:15:40):**  I mean, that thing's a...  
**[0:15:41-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:15:41):**  It's swinging a tree, you know, a 40 foot, 50 foot tree around like a matchstick.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:15:47):**  It's a dangerous place to be around.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:15:49):**  So yeah.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:15:50):**  Anyway, you get the picture.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:15:52):**  And then I've been in, I've got a client in England who's got a 4000 hectare chestnut and  
**[0:15:57-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:15:57):**  oak copper system.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:15:59):**  And it's magnificent.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:16:00):**  And he's got tons of people that have to work out there.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:16:03):**  And they all, you know, you've got charcoal people and he's got tool handle people and  
**[0:16:07-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:16:07):**  saw log people and biomass people and all sorts of people that are going out there and  
**[0:16:12-0:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:16:12):**  hunters and all the rest of it.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:16:15):**  It's so much better.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:16:17):**  And there's so much that comes out of it other than just the management of that landscape.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:16:21):**  But like you mentioned, the cultural elements, what it breeds is an understanding of the  
**[0:16:25-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:16:25):**  people who interact with it, of the value of these things as well, and how to interact  
**[0:16:30-0:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:16:30):**  with them in a healthy way.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:16:31):**  You can quag your bum with cork, right?  
**[0:16:33-0:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:16:33):**  Which is...  
**[0:16:34-0:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:16:34):**  They started making cork paper, who knows, maybe in the future.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:16:37):**  Well, well, I think unfortunately, they're having to extend their... they've had the  
**[0:16:44-0:16:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:16:44):**  real problem that everyone's the main user of cork, of course, is not Birkenstocks.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:16:51):**  It's been wine bottles and it's only now even champagne bottles or sparkling wine bottles  
**[0:16:57-0:17:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:16:57):**  are going with metal tops.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:17:01):**  So of course, as an industry, they're going, all right, well, what are the other uses that  
**[0:17:05-0:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:17:05):**  we can use cork for?  
**[0:17:06-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:17:06):**  Which is ridiculous, of course.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:17:11):**  So let's talk a little bit again about the harvesting aspect.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:17:15):**  In one of the sections on harvesting, you cover sort of the main categories of products  
**[0:17:19-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:17:19):**  that have economic value in forest systems, which are fruits, nuts, timber, and forage.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:17:25):**  Could you talk about balancing the need to create efficient harvesting and maintenance  
**[0:17:29-0:17:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:17:29):**  designs, oftentimes that include machinery, with the fact that natural forest systems  
**[0:17:34-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:17:34):**  don't grow in a way that are conducive to that type of large-scale management and involve  
**[0:17:39-0:17:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:17:39):**  much more diverse polycultures that are sometimes at odds with the economics of the farm?  
**[0:17:45-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:17:45):**  Yeah, well, that's part of the seriousness of planning in this.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:17:51):**  And that's why I sort of speak as a bit of a canary for a lot of people in that there's  
**[0:17:56-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:17:56):**  all of these loud, powerful voices out there that are promoting all of this stuff.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:18:02):**  And it all looks great and it sounds great, but then the rubber hits the road with very  
**[0:18:11-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:18:11):**  much the points that you've raised.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:18:13):**  I've done a lot of forestry in my life since I was a kid.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:18:17):**  So I know the game pretty well, both with fruit trees, but particularly with timber  
**[0:18:22-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:18:22):**  and coppicing systems.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:18:24):**  I mean, our farm had three different forests on it, and then it was surrounded by a native,  
**[0:18:30-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:18:30):**  or what is now a national park, and it was a state park at the time, which we also used  
**[0:18:35-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:18:35):**  to interact with and manage before it was all locked up.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:18:39):**  So I know how much time it takes.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:18:43):**  And I suppose the first half of my career where I was a younger, you might say bright  
**[0:18:49-0:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:18:49):**  eyed, bushy tailed, eager beaver, and I didn't have this platform in front of me, then my  
**[0:18:58-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:18:58):**  eagerness saw me see the world through the tree, as opposed to see the world through  
**[0:19:04-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:19:04):**  a well managed tree.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:19:06):**  Even though we always promoted to people from the get go that if you're going to get the  
**[0:19:13-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:19:13):**  results that are there, then you need to manage.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:19:17):**  But even then, we just weren't paying enough attention, I think, to understanding as well  
**[0:19:25-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:19:25):**  as we could the time and motion that that would take, the commitment that would take,  
**[0:19:30-0:19:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:19:30):**  the famine and feast festival that goes on.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:19:34):**  It's a long time between drinks with a lot of these woody plant systems.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:19:39):**  You've got a lot of spending to do of time and money and energy and all the rest of it  
**[0:19:46-0:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:19:46):**  before you actually get a yield, which pays that back.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:19:52):**  And then you've got all of the other things that you've got to do, which is particularly  
**[0:19:56-0:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:19:56):**  difficult for people in a transition because you really don't want to load yourself up  
**[0:20:00-0:20:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:20:00):**  and I probably talked about this with you last time, you don't want to load yourself  
**[0:20:03-0:20:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:20:03):**  up with too much new innovation.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:20:06):**  So I think, take a five or 10 year or even 20 year approach to the establishment of the  
**[0:20:16-0:20:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:20:16):**  system so that you don't bite off more than you can chew, that you don't have more in  
**[0:20:21-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:20:21):**  front of you.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:20:22):**  And such that, we did an interview, I think it was last year with Andrew Stewart and Rowan  
**[0:20:29-0:20:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:20:29):**  Reid.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:20:30):**  Rowan Reid is a very well known person in Australia, at least.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:20:33):**  He released a book last year called Heartwood, which is a brilliant book.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:20:37):**  Before that he released a book, I think in 1994 called the Agroforestry for Australia  
**[0:20:46-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:20:46):**  and New Zealand.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:20:47):**  And it still is ostensibly out 30 years later or whatever, 35 years later, sorry, 25 years  
**[0:20:56-0:20:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:20:56):**  later.  
**[0:20:57-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:20:57):**  The main manual for agroforestry in Australia and New Zealand.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:21:01):**  Anyway I spoke to him and his offside or his old mate Andrew Stewart, who's a sheep producer,  
**[0:21:07-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:21:07):**  but Andrew went back to his farm and started putting agroforestry systems in, shelter belts,  
**[0:21:15-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:21:15):**  timber belts, block plantings, blah, blah, blah, with a view in large part to timber  
**[0:21:20-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:21:20):**  production, to high quality timber production.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:21:23):**  Well after his 25 years of development, we're all about the same, oh they're a bit older  
**[0:21:27-0:21:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:21:27):**  than me, but mid to late 50s.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:21:30):**  Very fit men, they've got kids that have grown up, et cetera, on these properties.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:21:38):**  The volume of woody biomass and the value of that has now exceeded what their previous  
**[0:21:46-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:21:46):**  and still coexisting agricultural system does.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:21:51):**  So that's a succession that's occurred, but that's occurred by them being conscious managers  
**[0:21:57-0:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:21:57):**  of time and energy of their context, their social context and their financial context,  
**[0:22:05-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:22:05):**  to the point where they've layered in another whole range of production outcomes which are  
**[0:22:13-0:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:22:13):**  of higher value in biomass production than the original.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:22:17):**  I think that's a really great case to look at.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:22:21):**  And they've done that responsibly.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:22:23):**  So I often look at things like that and I look at my early part of my career where I  
**[0:22:27-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:22:27):**  probably planted too many trees on some clients, well not so probably, I did encourage the  
**[0:22:34-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:22:34):**  planting of too many trees at once on particular clients' properties, when I should have known,  
**[0:22:42-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:22:42):**  and I know better now, that they were never going to be able to look after them all.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:22:46):**  And so I've got a few shitty plantations around which I'm not, you know, it's great to plant  
**[0:22:51-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:22:51):**  millions of trees, but I would have preferred that most of them were in a better state than  
**[0:23:00-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:23:00):**  what they are now.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:23:01):**  I mean, they're grown, that's great.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:23:03):**  So they're there, they're photosynthesizing and they're performing ecosystem services  
**[0:23:07-0:23:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:23:07):**  and all of the rest of it, which is all fantastic, stabilized, you know, they've taken carbon  
**[0:23:12-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:23:12):**  out of the atmosphere and all that great stuff.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:23:15):**  But in terms of developing the end results, which I pitched to those clients or that they  
**[0:23:23-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:23:23):**  wanted from me, I probably went too hard on going, yeah, you should do this many.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:23:28):**  I should have done fewer and better rather than more and not so well.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:23:34):**  Quality over quantity.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:23:35):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:23:36):**  Which, let's not open that Pandora's.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:23:43):**  So look, the challenge for a lot of people that I've talked to who want to get started  
**[0:23:47-0:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:23:47):**  in agroforestry is the initial investment of buying and planting all the trees needed,  
**[0:23:51-0:23:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:23:51):**  especially for large acreage.  
**[0:23:54-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:23:54):**  And so how would you recommend someone get started with a small scale or a small or medium  
**[0:23:58-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:23:58):**  scale tree nursery so they don't bite off more than they can chew like we were just  
**[0:24:02-0:24:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:24:02):**  talking about, not only to bring down initial costs, but to begin, especially to select  
**[0:24:06-0:24:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:24:06):**  for desired trace and resiliency or even experiment with species that maybe they weren't accustomed  
**[0:24:12-0:24:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:24:12):**  to in the beginning?  
**[0:24:14-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:24:14):**  Yeah, not a big encourager of going too radical there.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:24:18):**  And again, it's kind of like, all right, let's just follow the 80-20 rule.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:24:23):**  Stick with what you know, what are most likely to be the best bet species and maybe just  
**[0:24:29-0:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:24:29):**  do 10 or 20%, which are the experiments.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:24:33):**  If you go the other way around, well then, that's just too innovative on a whole range  
**[0:24:38-0:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:24:38):**  of levels.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:24:39):**  So, you've got to cover your bases first.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:24:41):**  Oh yeah, you've got it, yeah, exactly.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:24:43):**  So if you're looking at doing this commercially, I mean, you don't, you know, if you run it,  
**[0:24:46-0:24:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:24:46):**  if you start a new business, generally, you don't go and start with 80% of what you're  
**[0:24:56-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:24:56):**  doing is being unlikely, well, a high chance of not working.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:25:03):**  You maybe go out there with 5% or 2% or something, right?  
**[0:25:08-0:25:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:25:08):**  If you're going to give yourself any chance of success, probably.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:25:11):**  And really, it's no different in this sort of stuff.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:25:13):**  So there's lots of different techniques for being able to grow a lot of trees in a small  
**[0:25:21-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:25:21):**  space.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:25:22):**  I mean, some people get old fruit bins, you know, and I know people like, oh, my friend  
**[0:25:30-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:25:30):**  Harry Green, who's part of the Propagate Ventures group.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:25:37):**  He was growing chestnuts and I think that was his name, Grant Schultz of Versaland years  
**[0:25:43-0:25:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:25:43):**  ago, he was getting an old wooden fruit bin or an IBC or something like that, filling  
**[0:25:49-0:25:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:25:49):**  it up with some soil, and just some potting soil, and then putting a whole lot of acorns  
**[0:25:55-0:25:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:25:55):**  or chestnuts in there and overstocking the system so that you've got this above ground  
**[0:25:59-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:25:59):**  bare root nursery, where you can grow a two foot deep root system and a really healthy  
**[0:26:05-0:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:26:05):**  plant in a really small amount of area.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:26:07):**  I mean, that sort of stuff's really easy to do.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:26:09):**  And you can do that with fruit trees and all sorts of things.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:26:13):**  But then you've got stuff that has to be grown smaller seed and perhaps need something to  
**[0:26:19-0:26:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:26:19):**  go in a container.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:26:20):**  Well, there's lots of different containers that are out there, the type of containers  
**[0:26:24-0:26:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:26:24):**  that are fused together into a number of cells, and you know, have have root system or they  
**[0:26:31-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:26:31):**  have, they're between four to eight inches deep, or you know, between 100 to 200 millimetres  
**[0:26:41-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:26:41):**  deep, and they have a hole at the bottom which you can suspend on some mesh.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:26:47):**  So the plants that you grow in there can, when the roots get down, they air prune and  
**[0:26:52-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:26:52):**  the roots don't come back up like a J inside of the pot.  
**[0:26:56-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:26:56):**  There's those sorts of things.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:26:58):**  You can generally get potting mix, you know, if you live in the US, for example, go to  
**[0:27:02-0:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:27:02):**  Home Depot, the potting mix there is not great, but it's not that bad either.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:27:08):**  And you can get away with that.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:27:10):**  Or you can go to, you know, go to your local nursery supply or whatever.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:27:15):**  You can get if you want to go a bit further, you can usually in the nursery trade, you  
**[0:27:19-0:27:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:27:19):**  can buy one cubic meter or one cubic yard blocks of potting mix, which is a really economic  
**[0:27:26-0:27:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:27:26):**  way of buying it as opposed to buying those plastic bags.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:27:31):**  All of that stuff.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:27:32):**  So they've often got, you know, you can take the bags back and all that sort of stuff.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:27:36):**  So that sort of thing really great.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:27:39):**  Or of course, you can go and make your own if you really can.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:27:43):**  But the type of containerised systems are really good.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:27:48):**  And then you just start small.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:27:49):**  I mean, we had a nursery way back when we just used waxed milk cartons.  
**[0:27:55-0:28:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:27:55):**  Yeah, which we put a couple of holes in and we put them into borrowed milk crates because  
**[0:28:02-0:28:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:28:02):**  everyone borrows milk crates as we realise.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:28:07):**  And we put those in our milk crate and I'd put an acorn in each one.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:28:11):**  And it was a nice, you know, it's nearly a foot deep and I suspended those up so that  
**[0:28:16-0:28:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:28:16):**  as the as the roots came down, they didn't J inside.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:28:20):**  I've got a very cheap big container and I go I used to give them away and sell them  
**[0:28:25-0:28:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:28:25):**  and there's trees all over, there's oak trees all over the place, cork oaks and holm oaks  
**[0:28:29-0:28:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:28:29):**  and turkey oaks and all sorts of different oaks that I used to grow that I can now visit  
**[0:28:36-0:28:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:28:36):**  and be in wonder about.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:28:40):**  So that was actually one of the first things I started to do when I first moved to Spain  
**[0:28:43-0:28:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:28:43):**  was just like going and collecting seeds that had fallen because I got here just before  
**[0:28:46-0:28:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:28:46):**  the autumn and I've been sprouting things in like old plastic water jug containers and  
**[0:28:53-0:28:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:28:53):**  anything else.  
**[0:28:54-0:28:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:28:54):**  Whatever.  
**[0:28:55-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:28:55):**  Exactly like that.  
**[0:28:56-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:28:56):**  And you know, the one that I've been having success with lately is the pomegranates.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:28:59):**  Of course, there's a million seeds in any one of those fruits and you just, you know,  
**[0:29:03-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:29:03):**  pack a spot with them, make sure the soil is deep enough and they start coming up just  
**[0:29:06-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:29:06):**  as well.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:29:07):**  Yeah, they do.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:29:08):**  They do.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:29:09):**  And then you can get then you've got the whole cutting culture and all that.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:29:13):**  The best you can either go and get very product orientated in this whole nursery space where  
**[0:29:19-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:29:19):**  you get the right container and you get the right misting system and the right blah, blah,  
**[0:29:24-0:29:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:29:24):**  right polytunnel and all that.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:29:26):**  But then you've got a lot of people who develop these really well, they get they've got green  
**[0:29:32-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:29:32):**  thumbs or they develop them and they just use the refuse of society.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:29:38):**  Anything from a toilet roll to a, to a little stuff.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:29:40):**  There's just so much.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:29:41):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:29:42):**  So much stuff that you can use as a container.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:29:45):**  They use their own compost, which they mix with sand, you know, river sand or whatever  
**[0:29:49-0:29:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:29:49):**  going on.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:29:50):**  And they just, they just get by.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:29:51):**  And again, it's that 80 20 rule.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:29:54):**  It may not be as great as you can buy and it might cost you a bit more, but have you  
**[0:29:58-0:29:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:29:58):**  had a good time?  
**[0:29:59-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:29:59):**  Has it made you feel good?  
**[0:30:00-0:30:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:30:00):**  Well, you know, a lot of people are short on those feelings these days.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:30:03):**  So why the hell not?  
**[0:30:06-0:30:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:30:06):**  There's good value just in that alone.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:30:07):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:30:08):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:30:09):**  And being able to come a friend coming around and giving a plant away.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:30:11):**  I mean, how good does that make you feel?  
**[0:30:13-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:30:13):**  And then going and looking at that in 20 years time.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:30:15):**  That's a great feeling.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:30:16):**  That's one of the best gifts you can give.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:30:19):**  It just keeps getting better over time.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:30:20):**  Everything else moves towards entropy.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:30:22):**  Yeah, that's right.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:30:24):**  So look, let's focus lastly on the last section of the forestry chapter.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:30:30):**  And this is increasingly important these days with climate change and really degraded landscapes,  
**[0:30:35-0:30:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:30:35):**  especially for many temperate forests.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:30:37):**  We're talking about fire now and fires, of course, are a natural and healthy part of  
**[0:30:42-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:30:42):**  the cycle of these types of forests.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:30:45):**  How can we manage our design for us in fire ecologies and help to prevent the catastrophic  
**[0:30:50-0:30:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:30:50):**  fires that we've seen in recent years in places like California and Australia?  
**[0:30:56-0:30:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:30:56):**  By intervening.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:30:59):**  And that's largely, we had to talk about this last week because this week in the current  
**[0:31:07-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:31:07):**  wrecks that we've got, we're in the, well, sorry, the last week that we just did was  
**[0:31:11-0:31:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:31:11):**  buildings and before that we did forestry.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:31:14):**  And so, and forestry is always a topic which carries over.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:31:17):**  Now people pick when we've got our Q&A, even though it was the building week, people asking  
**[0:31:23-0:31:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:31:23):**  questions about forestry.  
**[0:31:24-0:31:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:31:24):**  Because there's such an enthusiasm for the whole topic, the whole layer.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:31:31):**  And we're talking about fire naturally.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:31:32):**  And we've had, as you might have heard, some pretty big fire events here in Australia.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:31:36):**  Millions of, literally millions of hectares, which is millions of acres where people are  
**[0:31:41-0:31:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:31:41):**  living.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:31:42):**  So, not sort of areas where people aren't living.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:31:45):**  These are people where a lot of people are living.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:31:48):**  Anyway, and it's been amazing that so few people have died and my thoughts go to their  
**[0:31:56-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:31:56):**  families.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:31:57):**  But there's, one of the biggest reasons, it's hard to put your finger on one reason why  
**[0:32:04-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:32:04):**  these things happen.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:32:05):**  There's always a number.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:32:07):**  But one of them is just that it's political.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:32:09):**  And this is what I was talking about.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:32:10):**  There's a lot of people who are ecologically illiterate, unfortunately.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:32:17):**  And that's a growing phenomenon, unfortunately.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:32:19):**  It's one of the reasons why we invested our money to build a house in something like the  
**[0:32:23-0:32:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:32:23):**  poly faces for a film.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:32:26):**  And it's one of the reasons why we're putting everything else into this book, because we  
**[0:32:30-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:32:30):**  want to raise the bar of ecological literacy, so that people when they make voting decisions,  
**[0:32:38-0:32:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:32:38):**  don't support people who support particular policies that lack intervention.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:32:43):**  Now, I don't, I really don't want to, and this is the tightrope of this, because there's,  
**[0:32:49-0:32:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:32:49):**  I don't want to say personally, a situation where that intervention goes too far.  
**[0:32:56-0:32:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:32:56):**  It's always the case, you know.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:32:58):**  It's not, you shouldn't have or feel that it's okay to have, you know, be at one end  
**[0:33:08-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:33:08):**  of the pendulum or other.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:33:10):**  And one end is where we...  
**[0:33:11-0:33:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:33:11):**  Yeah, balance is paramount.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:33:12):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:33:13):**  I mean, it's a balanced game.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:33:15):**  And I was listening to some Aboriginal fire makers and managers recently on YouTube.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:33:26):**  And because, you know, where's their voice been in all of this?  
**[0:33:30-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:33:30):**  You know, I'd say North America, it's hardly been there.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:33:33):**  And that's a function of colonialism.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:33:35):**  And now we should be damn well past colonialism by now.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:33:39):**  I mean, you know, it's been a while since it kind of happened.  
**[0:33:43-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:33:43):**  You sort of go, hey, these people were here a while, they seem to be doing alright.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:33:48):**  So we come along and then all of the shit hit the fan, you know, well, maybe there's  
**[0:33:51-0:33:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:33:51):**  a reason for that.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:33:53):**  Maybe we should go and talk to them a little bit more.  
**[0:33:55-0:33:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:33:55):**  So that's starting to happen.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:33:58):**  And it's amazing.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:34:00):**  You sort of go, oh, right, well, we do this, this and this.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:34:04):**  Oh, those interventions aren't as bad as the ones that we have.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:34:08):**  Maybe we should do that a bit more.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:34:10):**  But you know, we aren't.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:34:13):**  And you've still got the dynamics of policy.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:34:16):**  And it's complex because as well as it is in agricultural policy, forestry policy is  
**[0:34:23-0:34:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:34:23):**  the same.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:34:24):**  There's entrenched orthodoxies of practice and thought, which are in themselves often  
**[0:34:33-0:34:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:34:33):**  based on that they have colonial underpinnings, you know, there's a lot of stuff.  
**[0:34:39-0:34:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:34:39):**  There's a lot of practices in both agriculture and in well, in all forms of culture, but  
**[0:34:45-0:34:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:34:45):**  in agriculture and forestry, which, which haven't haven't stepped outside of their colonial  
**[0:34:51-0:34:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:34:51):**  underpinnings.  
**[0:34:53-0:34:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:34:53):**  And so there's a lot of concepts which have come from the old world, which have come to  
**[0:34:56-0:35:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:34:56):**  the new world, which are just totally inappropriate still.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:35:00):**  And in large part, fire management is, I would say is part of that, you know, you've got  
**[0:35:07-0:35:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:35:07):**  largely European experts and policymakers and managers who are managing these systems  
**[0:35:15-0:35:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:35:15):**  through the lens of, of colonials, as opposed to considering how they systems will once  
**[0:35:23-0:35:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:35:23):**  managed before by in the case of the Australian continent, possibly 100,000 years of continuous  
**[0:35:30-0:35:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:35:30):**  management, which is an unfathomable amount of time.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:35:35):**  And in the American continents, perhaps 15 or 20 or 30,000 years of time.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:35:41):**  So, you know, that's one place to go.  
**[0:35:46-0:35:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:35:46):**  The other place to go is where we're using fire.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:35:50):**  And we're encouraging the use of fire management with fire itself.  
**[0:35:55-0:36:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:35:55):**  And then there's the use of which is sort of maybe a halfway and perhaps a bit of a  
**[0:36:00-0:36:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:36:00):**  new intervention because we have this possibility.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:36:03):**  I mean, indigenous people didn't have electric fences.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:36:07):**  And that sort of thing, they didn't, they didn't have some of the tools that we now  
**[0:36:11-0:36:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:36:11):**  have at our disposal, and a different, a different vehicle for the reduction of fuel biomass,  
**[0:36:20-0:36:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:36:20):**  which is, you know, often the problem with these things.  
**[0:36:24-0:36:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:36:24):**  So we can use livestock to manage that as well.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:36:26):**  But then, of course, you've got non indigenous livestock integrating in with indigenous plantings,  
**[0:36:33-0:36:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:36:33):**  and then that opens up a whole  
**[0:36:34-0:36:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:36:34):**  ecological plandora's box and so on it goes and when, when in actuality, I mean, obviously,  
**[0:36:46-0:36:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:36:46):**  you know, we're, we're largely dealing with with highly dessert, disturbed ecosystems,  
**[0:36:53-0:37:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:36:53):**  which have perhaps for two or three or 400 years, or maybe more in South America in particular,  
**[0:37:00-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:37:00):**  that have maybe had 500 years of European intervention, and then hands off, and you  
**[0:37:07-0:37:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:37:07):**  can't expect that, you know, you've got missing pieces everywhere.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:37:11):**  I mean, where's all of, you know, we've lost hundreds of species of mammalian species,  
**[0:37:18-0:37:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:37:18):**  which used to live in that you can't just replace them, and all of their dynamic functions  
**[0:37:23-0:37:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:37:23):**  and all of the species that we didn't even know exist, which are now extinct at settlement,  
**[0:37:29-0:37:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:37:29):**  you can't just go and replace them all of a sudden, and just create a species factory.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:37:34):**  So you have to deal with analogs, and that's the best we can do.  
**[0:37:38-0:37:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:37:38):**  And so, you know, the notion of using analogs as a management tool, you know, we had megafauna  
**[0:37:44-0:37:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:37:44):**  here now, we don't have a lot of them now.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:37:46):**  So we had them once we did don't have them there, you used to have bison all across the  
**[0:37:50-0:37:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:37:50):**  North American continent, where are they now?  
**[0:37:53-0:37:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:37:53):**  Buffalo bills will fit to them, you know.  
**[0:37:56-0:37:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:37:56):**  So, so what are we going to use?  
**[0:37:58-0:38:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:37:58):**  Will we use the herbivores that we that we brought over from Eurasia?  
**[0:38:02-0:38:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:38:02):**  So that's another way that and then we've got humans with chainsaws.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:38:07):**  Why can't why have it's a common trait that in most of the Western countries that practice  
**[0:38:15-0:38:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:38:15):**  forestry, there's very little value added.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:38:17):**  There's there's not a lot of intervention, there's no thinning or pruning or any of that  
**[0:38:22-0:38:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:38:22):**  small family sawmills have gone from everywhere.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:38:27):**  So you know, how many sawmill roads are there across the colonised world?  
**[0:38:32-0:38:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:38:32):**  And you drive down, there's no bloody sawmill there, right?  
**[0:38:34-0:38:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:38:34):**  So so we see all of that.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:38:37):**  And the absence of that higher value utilisation is also part of it as well.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:38:43):**  Even though the species I know here in Australia, it's like we've come the best species in the  
**[0:38:47-0:38:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:38:47):**  world have just just gone up in smoke, but the people value them now.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:38:51):**  Can they access them?  
**[0:38:52-0:38:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:38:52):**  No.  
**[0:38:53-0:39:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:38:53):**  So some idiot in town who thinks they're doing good, votes or promotes a hands off ecological  
**[0:39:05-0:39:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:39:05):**  management system, which is, well, comes to a conflagration.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:39:12):**  And it's just not reflective of how these things were managed originally, too, like  
**[0:39:16-0:39:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:39:16):**  there were always some interactions and interventions for 1000s and 1000s of years, even before  
**[0:39:23-0:39:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:39:23):**  humanisation.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:39:24):**  And I think it would be much more prudent to understand, to interact in a positive way  
**[0:39:28-0:39:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:39:28):**  with these rather than just say they're off limits and basically getting licensed to damage  
**[0:39:34-0:39:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:39:34):**  the rest of them.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:39:35):**  Well, that's right.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:39:36):**  And a lot of these people will, you know, on one hand, I mean, the hypocrites, someone  
**[0:39:40-0:39:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:39:40):**  because on one hand, they'll stand up for indigenous rights or that, this, that and  
**[0:39:44-0:39:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:39:44):**  the other.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:39:45):**  But then they won't allow humans to be a part of a forest when humans, indigenous humans  
**[0:39:54-0:39:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:39:54):**  have always been part of that forest.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:39:57):**  So you know, this, but that's just the disconnect that crosses all forms of society.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:40:01):**  Well, it goes back to like you're saying it just requires a better literacy of ecological  
**[0:40:08-0:40:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:40:08):**  knowledge in general.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:40:10):**  And the work to raise that bar is more important than anything.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:40:14):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:40:15):**  Because there might be a few experts, but if everybody else who doesn't understand these  
**[0:40:20-0:40:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:40:20):**  are still voting and making decisions, it's hard to make any real change.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:40:23):**  Oh, yeah.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:40:24):**  Oh, yeah.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:40:25):**  So I guess in your your opinion, and with this focus on forests that we did today, do  
**[0:40:30-0:40:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:40:30):**  you think forests and woody perennial species in general can provide a substantial amount  
**[0:40:36-0:40:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:40:36):**  of the world's food needs?  
**[0:40:37-0:40:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:40:37):**  And is that even what we should be working towards?  
**[0:40:40-0:40:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:40:40):**  Well, it's a whole other discussion.  
**[0:40:43-0:40:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:40:43):**  I mean, I have a, I have an unfinished essay that's been out there for some time.  
**[0:40:47-0:40:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:40:47):**  It's called the problem of the omnivore, which is sort of a move, a play on words, paying  
**[0:40:54-0:40:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:40:54):**  homage to Michael Pollan's bestseller, the omnivores dilemma.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:40:59):**  But I think we have a real problem as an omnivore.  
**[0:41:01-0:41:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:41:01):**  And you know, if you are truly going to understand ecology, well, then you tend to start with  
**[0:41:06-0:41:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:41:06):**  understanding the trophic levels and, and how they're all functioning with each other.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:41:12):**  That's really basic.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:41:13):**  I mean, I learned that in biology in year 10, in form four, right?  
**[0:41:18-0:41:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:41:18):**  So 10th grade.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:41:20):**  So it's, you know, anybody who's had a Western education will have, that I've talked to pretty  
**[0:41:26-0:41:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:41:26):**  well knows that in the same year, that's what they give you.  
**[0:41:28-0:41:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:41:28):**  And you go, okay, but where do you see that?  
**[0:41:31-0:41:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:41:31):**  So and so when we look at the state of the world right now, we have a population which  
**[0:41:38-0:41:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:41:38):**  I believe, yeah, look, yes, if we had a highly functioning poly tree, you know, the right  
**[0:41:49-0:41:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:41:49):**  number, you know, all of the stuff that you've just painted, could we feed the world with  
**[0:41:52-0:41:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:41:52):**  that?  
**[0:41:54-0:41:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:41:54):**  We could probably feed the number of people but, but we wouldn't have as many chickens  
**[0:41:58-0:42:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:41:58):**  and pigs.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:42:01):**  Because if we take the fossil fuel energy part out, and then we reduce the number of  
**[0:42:06-0:42:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:42:06):**  annuals that we are producing, the number of calories that come from annual plants will  
**[0:42:12-0:42:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:42:12):**  be significantly reduced.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:42:14):**  And that's, that's certainly a part of the future, which I think a lot of people are  
**[0:42:17-0:42:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:42:17):**  not considering.  
**[0:42:19-0:42:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:42:19):**  We're all addicted to annual plants, and they provide the primary volume of calories for  
**[0:42:27-0:42:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:42:27):**  our populations, and also the the the highest biomass of all animal biomass in the animal  
**[0:42:38-0:42:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:42:38):**  kingdom right now is made up of three omnivores, the chicken, the pig and the human.  
**[0:42:44-0:42:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:42:44):**  And that's just not that just doesn't fit in with the plan here.  
**[0:42:48-0:42:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:42:48):**  It's an ecological mistake to think that that's going to be able to continue for very long.  
**[0:42:55-0:42:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:42:55):**  And it's only fossil fuels which allow that to be so, you know, people say to me, I'd  
**[0:42:59-0:43:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:42:59):**  love to run more chickens under trees or so well, you won't.  
**[0:43:03-0:43:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:43:03):**  Because if you don't feed those chickens enough feed, then you won't have all those pigs and  
**[0:43:09-0:43:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:43:09):**  a feed of a particular quality, then you just won't be able to run the number that you will.  
**[0:43:15-0:43:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:43:15):**  It's just an ecological trophic, energetic reality and it's on, it's irrefutable.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:43:22):**  So, so that's, that's a big question.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:43:25):**  And that's going to be a big wake up call for a lot of people, I suppose that it may  
**[0:43:31-0:43:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:43:31):**  be more than a wake up call that we're going to have to contend with in a future where  
**[0:43:39-0:43:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:43:39):**  the kinds of congealed energies that we base our civilization on currently are not as available  
**[0:43:45-0:43:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:43:45):**  as they once were.  
**[0:43:47-0:43:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:43:47):**  Yeah, and it leads down the rabbit hole, the larger question is, is any configuration of  
**[0:43:52-0:43:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:43:52):**  supporting the population we currently have sustainable or feasible for a much longer  
**[0:43:57-0:43:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:43:57):**  period of time?  
**[0:43:58-0:44:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:43:58):**  Oh, I mean, just think about distribute, I mean, all of the energy that goes into distribution  
**[0:44:02-0:44:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:44:02):**  and all of that stuff.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:44:03):**  I mean, look, you know, Elon Musk is going to come up with something, right?  
**[0:44:09-0:44:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:44:09):**  Well, I'm yet to see it.  
**[0:44:11-0:44:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:44:11):**  So, and especially when you look at the energy, you know, no one's having a real hard discussion  
**[0:44:18-0:44:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:44:18):**  about energy invested or energy return on energy invested, or the whole energy discussion  
**[0:44:25-0:44:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:44:25):**  and unfortunately, and so that's a whole honesty and literacy that people have got to get on  
**[0:44:33-0:44:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:44:33):**  board with.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:44:34):**  So, I prefer to be hopeful about that because I don't want to, I'm not naturally a doomsday  
**[0:44:40-0:44:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:44:40):**  or all of the rest of it, but by the same token, we have to understand our limits.  
**[0:44:47-0:44:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:44:47):**  Yeah, and you can't ignore reality.  
**[0:44:48-0:44:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:44:48):**  Well, you can't but then life begets life, it's quite phenomenal how much a system can  
**[0:44:53-0:44:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:44:53):**  produce and you know, look at what David Johnson and his partner Sue have done with the Johnson  
**[0:44:59-0:45:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:44:59):**  soon the beam composting method, and the volumes of biomass that they're able to produce by  
**[0:45:08-0:45:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:45:08):**  promoting a soil biology, which in itself has a huge biomass and that's how the end  
**[0:45:14-0:45:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:45:14):**  it that's how the traffic levels work.  
**[0:45:16-0:45:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:45:16):**  The more biomass you produce at the base, the more that you can then support as you  
**[0:45:21-0:45:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:45:21):**  go up the traffic levels.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:45:23):**  So there's a lot of promise out there.  
**[0:45:27-0:45:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:45:27):**  But there's no there's no future in anything that's not ecological because the kind of  
**[0:45:32-0:45:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:45:32):**  yields that David Johnson is getting and others that are getting in biomass is not happening  
**[0:45:39-0:45:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:45:39):**  by using artificial fertilizers.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:45:41):**  Because you just can't produce that much biomass and it's certainly not possible if you then  
**[0:45:46-0:45:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:45:46):**  look at how much energy it took to produce that fertilizer.  
**[0:45:51-0:45:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:45:51):**  It's just it's just a it's just an energetic stupidity to even entertain the exercise of  
**[0:45:59-0:46:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:45:59):**  trying to calculate that.  
**[0:46:00-0:46:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:46:00):**  So you're much better off just if you want to have a discussion about producing yield  
**[0:46:06-0:46:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:46:06):**  then get into the life business.  
**[0:46:09-0:46:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:46:09):**  Well I'll call up and bother you about all of this when you come up with another chapter.  
**[0:46:13-0:46:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:46:13):**  Yeah yeah yeah.  
**[0:46:15-0:46:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:46:15):**  Alright.  
**[0:46:16-0:46:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:46:16):**  Well brilliant Darren thanks so much for being so generous with your time.  
**[0:46:20-0:46:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:46:20):**  Before you go do you want to let our listeners know about some of the many resources that  
**[0:46:24-0:46:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:46:24):**  you have available for them to learn more and how they can get in contact with you and  
**[0:46:28-0:46:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:46:28):**  your team?  
**[0:46:29-0:46:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:46:29):**  So just go to the Regrarians.org website and in there they'll see the front page has got  
**[0:46:34-0:46:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:46:34):**  a number of panels which will make it as easy as possible.  
**[0:46:38-0:46:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:46:38):**  It's all black and white so that there's no gloss to gloss you over with.  
**[0:46:43-0:46:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:46:43):**  That's very that's very much on purpose.  
**[0:46:45-0:46:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:46:45):**  But just choose the panels.  
**[0:46:47-0:46:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:46:47):**  We've got the poly faces film of course which we've invested heavily in and has won many  
**[0:46:53-0:46:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:46:53):**  awards.  
**[0:46:54-0:47:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:46:54):**  That's there to click on so you can watch that as a streaming or get that as a DVD.  
**[0:47:01-0:47:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:47:01):**  Although the DVDs are going to shortly not be available so that's another story.  
**[0:47:07-0:47:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:47:07):**  So just go for the streamings and then we've also got the Regrarians Handbook of course  
**[0:47:12-0:47:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:47:12):**  and then we've got our courses and in 2020 we'll be doing a book tour because the book  
**[0:47:17-0:47:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:47:17):**  will be finished in 2020.  
**[0:47:18-0:47:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:47:18):**  There will be announcements on that and then we'll also do a number of courses and we've  
**[0:47:23-0:47:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:47:23):**  got our 13 week online course which we do two times a year which is great so you learn  
**[0:47:29-0:47:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:47:29):**  how to create your own farm plan and we work with you and support you for a year in that.  
**[0:47:35-0:47:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:47:35):**  Within our Regrarians workplace community which has got about 2,000 members now from  
**[0:47:40-0:47:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:47:40):**  about 50 countries mostly non-English speakers which is great because we've got this really  
**[0:47:46-0:47:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:47:46):**  vital community of leading agricultural regenerative agricultural practitioners and professional  
**[0:47:54-0:48:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:47:54):**  advocates and advisors and whatnot who in this one community you can converse in their  
**[0:48:01-0:48:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:48:01):**  own language which is always amazing to bear witness to.  
**[0:48:06-0:48:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:48:06):**  And yeah so that's that's the sort of things that people do but yeah keep an eye out go  
**[0:48:11-0:48:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:48:11):**  to the Regrarians website pay attention to our Facebook and Instagram channels and yeah  
**[0:48:17-0:48:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:48:17):**  sign up to join the become a member of the workplace.  
**[0:48:24-0:48:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:48:24):**  All good stuff well Darren again thank you for your time I look forward to catching up  
**[0:48:27-0:48:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:48:27):**  with you again next go around you have a great rest of the day.  
**[0:48:31-0:48:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:48:31):**  No worries mate well maybe maybe when we get to the soils chapter.  
**[0:48:34-0:48:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:48:34):**  I'm looking forward to it all right you take care.  
**[0:48:36-0:48:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:48:36):**  Thanks for your support thank you.  
**[0:48:40-0:48:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:48:40):**  All right that wraps things up for this week's episode if you enjoyed this interview and  
**[0:48:44-0:48:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:48:44):**  want to find more like it as well as articles and other resources you can find the full  
**[0:48:48-0:48:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:48:48):**  library of previous podcasts at abundantedge.com.  
**[0:48:52-0:48:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:48:52):**  The best part is that you can search by topic rather than wading through more than a hundred  
**[0:48:56-0:49:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:48:56):**  interviews by typing in any keyword or topic that you're looking for in the search function  
**[0:49:00-0:49:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:49:00):**  on the podcast page.  
**[0:49:02-0:49:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:49:02):**  I've spoken to experts on everything from growing your own food building homes from  
**[0:49:06-0:49:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:49:06):**  natural materials to beekeeping vermicompost permaculture design philosophy and so much  
**[0:49:12-0:49:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:49:12):**  more.  
**[0:49:13-0:49:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:49:13):**  Thank you so much to those of you who've taken the time to reach out via comments and emails  
**[0:49:17-0:49:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:49:17):**  your contributions helped me to make this the conversation that it's intended to be  
**[0:49:22-0:49:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darren-doherty-2/#t=0:49:22):**  and helps me create more of the content around the topics that you're interested in.

**[0:07:25-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:07:25):**  learned from homesteading and kind of rewilding that you've learned for such a long time.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:07:29):**  So what do you say we just jump into the questions?  
**[0:07:32-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:07:32):**  Let's do it.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:07:33):**  All right.

**[0:07:38-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:07:38):**  about how you sort of transitioned and tried out a lot of different things before getting  
**[0:07:42-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:07:42):**  here.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:07:44):**  Did you grow up with a family that was closely connected to nature or did you find your way  
**[0:07:48-0:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:07:48):**  there through a longer path?  
**[0:07:52-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:07:52):**  I grew up in the country.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:07:55):**  My family was, my dad just had a nine to five job, well, more like probably seven to eight  
**[0:08:05-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:08:05):**  PM job.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:08:07):**  And then my mom was able to mostly stay home with us and she was really connected with  
**[0:08:15-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:08:15):**  the natural world.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:08:19):**  Not in the exact same way that I am now, but like she spent a lot of time gardening and  
**[0:08:26-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:08:26):**  she spent a lot of time hiking in the woods and he did a lot of native plant rescues and  
**[0:08:31-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:08:31):**  she spent some time growing food, not a whole lot, but some.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:08:34):**  And my parents, we would go out and pick blackberries and do some seasonal foraging, which is really  
**[0:08:45-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:08:45):**  common in most parts of the world for everyone, but kind of rare in the US.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:08:49):**  So I was really lucky to have that.  
**[0:08:51-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:08:51):**  So I grew up definitely being able to wander through large tracts of forest and open fields.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:09:01):**  And I think that that was super helpful for me, but it was within a pretty conventional  
**[0:09:06-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:09:06):**  lifestyle.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:09:07):**  Okay.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:09:08):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:09:09):**  So within that sort of conventional lifestyle, what inspired you to kind of take a veer  
**[0:09:13-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:09:13):**  off in a different direction and really reconnect with nature and then get to the place where  
**[0:09:18-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:09:18):**  now you're teaching this to other people?  
**[0:09:20-0:09:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:09:20):**  Well, you know, a few things happened.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:09:23):**  One is when I was 15, I did something called Northwest Youth Corps.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:09:29):**  And so I went for six weeks and worked in the woods with a group of about 15 other kids  
**[0:09:37-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:09:37):**  and a couple of mentors.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:09:39):**  And we did trail maintenance and restoration and piled slash, made brush piles, burn piles,  
**[0:09:49-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:09:49):**  and just spent a bunch of time doing work in the National Forest.  
**[0:09:54-0:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:09:54):**  And that was huge for me, like just being immersed in nature.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:09:59):**  Like I'd gone hiking before that with my aunt, who was an amazing woman and really exposed  
**[0:10:04-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:10:04):**  me to nature a lot.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:10:05):**  But actually being like sleeping outside, drinking wild water, like that whole experience  
**[0:10:12-0:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:10:12):**  for six weeks being a teenager was pretty monumental.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:10:16):**  And so that really got me loving wildness.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:10:20):**  And then when I was 19, I was actually studying genetic engineering, which is just so ironic.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:10:27):**  But I was studying genetic engineering, I really wanted to help find a cure for AIDS.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:10:33):**  And I at the time was a junior at university, was just really like fast track for becoming  
**[0:10:44-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:10:44):**  a scientist.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:10:45):**  And then I got hit by a car.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:10:48):**  And that my whole life flashed before my eyes as you know, is so, you know, they say that  
**[0:10:57-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:10:57):**  happens and it did.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:10:59):**  And I really looked at my life and made some big choices.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:11:06):**  And I decided to quit school and go traveling and really, which I think is just, I mean,  
**[0:11:14-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:11:14):**  it's really interesting.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:11:15):**  Like what I ended up doing is very similar to what a lot of people in indigenous or traditional  
**[0:11:20-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:11:20):**  cultures do as far as some sort of adult initiation.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:11:24):**  But it was just kind of forced on me by being hit by this car, which was in some ways, I  
**[0:11:29-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:11:29):**  say the best thing that ever happened to me.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:11:32):**  And so I went traveling, I actually went to Spain on that trip, I went all over and I  
**[0:11:37-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:11:37):**  ended up living in a commune in Virginia for a little while.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:11:44):**  And then I went back to school and I studied ecological agriculture and like centered myself  
**[0:11:50-0:11:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:11:50):**  on a really different path that was much more earth centered and focused on deep and radical  
**[0:11:59-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:11:59):**  earth connection.

**[0:13:33-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:13:33):**  community, which had just gotten started.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:13:36):**  And I was there I was actually living in Atlanta.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:13:40):**  And because I was in Central America, I got sick and then my dad actually got sick at  
**[0:13:46-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:13:46):**  the same time I moved in.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:13:48):**  They were living in Atlanta at the time.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:13:49):**  So I moved in with them and was living there and just fell in love with the ecology of  
**[0:13:56-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:13:56):**  the southeast.

**[0:14:03-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:14:03):**  was into wild foods, because that was one of my big passions at the time.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:14:09):**  That was in the south.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:14:10):**  And one of my friends was like, Oh, you know, my friend just was part of starting this community  
**[0:14:16-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:14:16):**  called Wild Roots.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:14:17):**  So I went to the very first wild foods hike, which was, I guess, 18 years ago or so and  
**[0:14:25-0:14:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:14:25):**  hosted by Wild Roots.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:14:26):**  And then I moved there soon after and lived there for five years.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:14:34):**  And Wild Roots, I built a bark hut that I lived in, we got all of our water from springs  
**[0:14:43-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:14:43):**  and from the creek.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:14:45):**  And I built the bark hut out of hemlocks that it was before the fully adelgid hit the southeast.  
**[0:14:54-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:14:54):**  So out of hemlock saplings and tulip poplar bark and lashed it together with rawhide and  
**[0:15:01-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:15:01):**  hickory bark.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:15:03):**  And then, yeah, just and we started all of our fire by friction.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:15:08):**  We cooked all of our food over fire.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:15:10):**  It was super primitive, like very, very hardcore.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:15:14):**  And it was really, really awesome.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:15:16):**  And I was just living a dream.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:15:18):**  It was amazing.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:15:20):**  But then I, I really came to a place where I was really wanting to share that passion  
**[0:15:28-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:15:28):**  and that connection.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:15:29):**  And so I started this event called the Firefly Gathering, which is a, which is a primitive  
**[0:15:36-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:15:36):**  and just ecological skills gathering.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:15:40):**  It's called Skills for Living with the Earth.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:15:43):**  And it later at one time, it was the biggest or skills or primitive skills gathering in  
**[0:15:48-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:15:48):**  the country.

**[0:15:50-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:15:50):**  I passed it on two years ago, which was really amazing.  
**[0:15:57-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:15:57):**  And it's still happening here in North Carolina.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:15:59):**  So I started that.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:16:01):**  And that just so crazy these days, like, you know, organizing a primitive skills gathering,  
**[0:16:07-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:16:07):**  it's really hard to do when you when you live in a bark hut.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:16:12):**  When you live by those primitive skills.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:16:15):**  Exactly.

**[0:16:22-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:16:22):**  really able to do that work.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:16:23):**  And that work was becoming more and more important to me just the sharing skills for living close  
**[0:16:28-0:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:16:28):**  with Earth.

**[0:16:30-0:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:16:30):**  But but that time was was really lovely and very foundational for me.

**[0:17:48-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:17:48):**  And I mean, I actually visited once the teaching drum outdoor school and they're up in northern  
**[0:17:54-0:18:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:17:54):**  Wisconsin and they're living super primitively in the wintertime.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:18:00):**  And I mean, people have lived primitively in the wintertime throughout time.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:18:03):**  It's just a matter of being prepared and really knowing what you're doing and planning and  
**[0:18:09-0:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:18:09):**  having proper thing.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:18:10):**  And so it was it was fine.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:18:13):**  But the challenge I mean, honestly, my biggest challenge was I was like I was there mostly  
**[0:18:19-0:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:18:19):**  with a couple.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:18:21):**  And and there was one other woman who lived there on and off.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:18:25):**  And then we have visitors that came through.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:18:27):**  But I was single at the time and I was really lonely.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:18:32):**  And I ended up most weeks, I'd say I went down and stayed with a friend one night.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:18:39):**  And that was, I think, really helpful for me just to have more social interaction.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:18:44):**  But I think that then that that's just we as humans are social beings.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:18:51):**  And I think a lot of people have this idea of like going off alone into the wilderness.  
**[0:18:55-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:18:55):**  And it just doesn't work that way.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:18:57):**  So, so yeah, that was probably my biggest unmet need when I lived out there.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:19:04):**  And then the physical stuff was really challenging and really good.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:19:09):**  And I was young, and in my early 20s and very strong and really up to the challenge.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:19:16):**  So that was that was pretty okay.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:19:20):**  We, we definitely foraged a lot of our food, and that was awesome.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:19:28):**  And we were not able to meet all of our protein needs by trapping and hunting on the land.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:19:36):**  There just wasn't enough game to support it.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:19:38):**  But we did a lot of roadkill.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:19:40):**  And we picked up a lot of roadkill and that was great.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:19:43):**  We had a freezer at a neighbor's house for a while.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:19:47):**  And that was, that was helpful, you know, to keep that meat going through time.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:19:52):**  But eventually we phased that out and we, we just canned meat and dried meat and we're  
**[0:19:56-0:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:19:56):**  able to able to keep it that way.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:20:00):**  And most all of our vegetable needs were were met by were met by having a small garden and  
**[0:20:08-0:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:20:08):**  by foraging.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:20:10):**  And so, and by preserving the food that we forage from, from season to season so that  
**[0:20:15-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:20:15):**  we have access to it at different times.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:20:18):**  But you know, we still we still we dumpster dope some and we bought some food and, and  
**[0:20:24-0:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:20:24):**  so not all of our food needs were met off the land.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:20:28):**  But the vast majority were and it was, yeah, it was really, it took a lot of time.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:20:33):**  Like people, I think often have this idea that, you know, primitive people lived in  
**[0:20:39-0:20:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:20:39):**  this idyllic way where they hardly worked or anything like that.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:20:42):**  And it's just so bullshit.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:20:43):**  Like, we had to, I hope that's okay to say that.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:20:47):**  No, of course.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:20:48):**  Yeah.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:20:49):**  Um, but it took a lot of time.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:20:52):**  Like all of all of this foraging and all the food.  
**[0:20:55-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:20:55):**  I mean, the food processing is huge amounts of time.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:21:00):**  And um, and it's really fun and it's really fulfilling, but it's a huge amount of time.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:21:07):**  And uh, yeah, so that's something that I think a lot of people don't account for is the amount  
**[0:21:13-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:21:13):**  of time that it takes just to like wash all of these tubers that you have dug up or preserve  
**[0:21:20-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:21:20):**  a bunch of medicine and make tinctures and strain them, you know, or like pick all the  
**[0:21:25-0:21:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:21:25):**  leaves off of all of the, all of the nettles because the stems are actually a fiber crop  
**[0:21:32-0:21:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:21:32):**  and don't taste like you'd be chewing forever, you know?  
**[0:21:35-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:21:35):**  So um, yeah, there's a lot, a lot, a lot of time that goes into that.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:21:41):**  And I was able to take that time at that time in my life, you know, I didn't have any kids  
**[0:21:47-0:21:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:21:47):**  and I didn't have any debt, which was amazing.  
**[0:21:53-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:21:53):**  And I didn't have like the land was actually purchased by, um, kind of a philanthropist.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:22:00):**  So we didn't, we paid for the land taxes, but we didn't have a mortgage.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:22:04):**  And so all of us were able to put the time that it took into all of that, which was,  
**[0:22:10-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:22:10):**  which was such a blessing.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:22:13):**  And I, yeah, I really, I really loved it, but I think it's definitely not for everyone.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:22:18):**  And I think that if you have, you know, debt, if you have kids, if you have financial responsibilities,  
**[0:22:25-0:22:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:22:25):**  like it's really hard to do that.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:22:27):**  And it's especially a silly thing is I think I see a lot of people who, who take out big  
**[0:22:33-0:22:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:22:33):**  mortgages to buy some big piece of land and then they have to work all week and they don't

**[0:22:42-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:22:42):**  And that's just such a tragic, silly thing.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:22:46):**  I think it happens to people.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:22:49):**  It's tricky though.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:22:50):**  I mean, to operate in a system as, as a plan to get out of it.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:22:57):**  There's a lot of funny hoops that you have to jump through that seem counterintuitive  
**[0:23:00-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:23:00):**  to what your actual goals are.

**[0:23:06-0:23:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:23:06):**  And it's definitely been different for me all the different times that I've attempted  
**[0:23:09-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:23:09):**  to do this in different countries.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:23:10):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:23:11):**  I mean, the process of doing it again and navigating the system here in Spain, which  
**[0:23:15-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:23:15):**  is very different than it was in Guatemala, than it was in the United States, than it  
**[0:23:20-0:23:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:23:20):**  was in Africa, you know, and so on.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:23:23):**  So maybe that's something that we should put out some content on in the future is just

**[0:23:30-0:23:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:23:30):**  Yeah, it's huge.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:23:32):**  But I think one of the biggest things is just not biting up where you can chew.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:23:36):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:23:37):**  Oh yeah, small steps.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:23:38):**  I mean, that's probably the only universal thing that you could say in all contexts is  
**[0:23:42-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:23:42):**  like, don't get in over your head unless you really know what you're doing.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:23:46):**  Yeah.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:23:47):**  So within that transition, so you started to move away from this very primitive lifestyle  
**[0:23:52-0:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:23:52):**  out of a desire to be with more community and to share your skills.  
**[0:23:55-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:23:55):**  And this eventually led to you creating your own homestead.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:23:58):**  Can you talk about how you made that transition?  
**[0:24:02-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:24:02):**  Yeah, definitely.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:24:03):**  So I went from Wild Roots to living with my former partner up in Boone who had his own  
**[0:24:09-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:24:09):**  homestead up there and that didn't work out.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:24:13):**  And I had been looking with a big group of people to buy a big tract of land to start  
**[0:24:21-0:24:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:24:21):**  a community.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:24:22):**  And it was just too hard to find the piece of land that would meet everyone's needs.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:24:27):**  And so while that was going on, this piece of land, which was not at all what I was envisioning,  
**[0:24:33-0:24:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:24:33):**  like I was envisioning having some really wild, beautiful, intact land for me to play  
**[0:24:42-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:24:42):**  and have my whole primitive fantasy continue.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:24:50):**  And what ended up coming up, what ended up falling in my lap was a piece of land that  
**[0:24:55-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:24:55):**  was about 20 minutes outside of Asheville and was directly behind the land of some acquaintances  
**[0:25:06-0:25:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:25:06):**  where I had gone and actually cooked for a natural building workshop.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:25:10):**  And there were 17 acres that came up for sale and me and my partner at the time and my former  
**[0:25:22-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:25:22):**  herb teacher Juliet Plankes-Spore pooled money to buy the 17 acres and we immediately split  
**[0:25:29-0:25:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:25:29):**  it up into three parcels, which I think is a great model if you're going to be buying  
**[0:25:35-0:25:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:25:35):**  to buy basically in bulk and then have a set of neighbors that you're happy with.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:25:40):**  And we wrote in a bunch of things into our deeds so that we have right of first refusal  
**[0:25:46-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:25:46):**  over each other's land.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:25:47):**  And so like when someone leaves them, we get somebody else who we like to take their place.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:25:52):**  And a bunch of other, all sorts of things into our deeds so that we're just kind of  
**[0:25:57-0:26:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:25:57):**  guaranteeing certain things for our future.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:26:00):**  Not having like a bunch of loud hunting dog breeding facilities next door and stuff.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:26:05):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:26:06):**  No, those are some essential things to think about.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:26:08):**  It's really good that you did that kind of fore planning.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:26:11):**  Oh man, it's so good.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:26:12):**  It was largely someone else's doing, which I'm so thankful for.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:26:18):**  And so we got this land and Juliette who runs the Chestnut School of Herbal Medicine, it's  
**[0:26:25-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:26:25):**  now a really big online presence.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:26:28):**  She and I were going to pool money together and build a school, actually on the other  
**[0:26:34-0:26:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:26:34):**  side of what's now my land.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:26:37):**  And she was going to teach her herb classes there a couple days a week and then I was  
**[0:26:41-0:26:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:26:41):**  going to teach my classes there a couple days a week.

**[0:26:53-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:26:53):**  I had started Wild Abundance before then, soon after I started Firefly, just as a place  
**[0:26:59-0:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:26:59):**  where I could see students progression throughout a longer period of time rather than over four  
**[0:27:07-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:27:07):**  days, which the Firefly event is just four days.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:27:10):**  And it's just been phenomenal how it's all come together and bringing on, there's now  
**[0:27:18-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:27:18):**  four of us who do all the administration for the school and the marketing and all that.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:27:23):**  And then there's a huge team of teachers, we have like 20 teachers and all sorts of  
**[0:27:30-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:27:30):**  classes ranging from Earth Skills and Permaculture, which is our flagship program.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:27:36):**  And that's like a one weekend, a month, eight month long program.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:27:40):**  And then we have one class that's been really, really successful for us is Women's Carpentry.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:27:47):**  And that's just been so cool to expose women to these skills that just are so awesome for  
**[0:27:54-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:27:54):**  empowerment.  
**[0:27:55-0:27:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:27:55):**  And so, yeah, we teach a lot.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:27:58):**  We are a tiny house class, it's almost full actually, and it's just not until August.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:28:04):**  So yeah, we have regular permaculture classes, we have this long permaculture class, we have  
**[0:28:09-0:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:28:09):**  wild crafting, we have women's rewilding, which has been really fun kind of getting  
**[0:28:14-0:28:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:28:14):**  back to my roots with that class.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:28:16):**  And then we have an eight month apprenticeship that's a residential apprenticeship, people  
**[0:28:20-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:28:20):**  live on site for in these little seasonal huts for eight months.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:28:27):**  And that's a really fulfilling program.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:28:29):**  So yeah, it's kind of, it's like a become a community, huge community piece of, it's  
**[0:28:36-0:28:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:28:36):**  funny, I'm recovering from the flu, and I'm having trouble, like placing certain words.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:28:41):**  It's a pillar of the community.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:28:44):**  And it's like brought a lot of primitive skills and Earth based living to an audience that  
**[0:28:50-0:28:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:28:50):**  I think otherwise wouldn't necessarily be exposed to it.  
**[0:28:54-0:29:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:28:54):**  Like I come from a very like, anarcho-primitivist background and who comes to our classes like  
**[0:29:00-0:29:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:29:00):**  we have, we have some people who come from that background, especially who do work to  
**[0:29:03-0:29:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:29:03):**  aid for our classes, but it's exposing these skills to just so many different people.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:29:09):**  And that feels really good to me.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:29:12):**  I can imagine.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:29:13):**  Now, with all of these things going on on the homestead, let's take a step back and  
**[0:29:18-0:29:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:29:18):**  kind of review the main structure of the place.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:29:20):**  So after you subdivided that land, how much do you have kind of that you manage yourself?  
**[0:29:28-0:29:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:29:28):**  Seven acres.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:29:29):**  Okay.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:29:30):**  And from there, how many people live on it?  
**[0:29:32-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:29:32):**  And kind of what are the main things that time is dedicated to within the land?

**[0:29:42-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:29:42):**  I guess there's like seven or eight of us that live here year round.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:29:48):**  And then during the green season, I think there's like 14 something like that.  
**[0:29:56-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:29:56):**  And yeah, we have a little community.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:30:00):**  And then we're also surrounded by friends and neighbors who are friends who are our

**[0:30:06-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:30:06):**  Like I can to contrast this one with when I lived at Wild Roots where I just didn't

**[0:30:30-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:30:30):**  She's three years old in her.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:30:31):**  Well, I don't know if they really are best friends yet.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:30:33):**  I don't know if that's a thing when you're three, but she has a friend who lives like  
**[0:30:37-0:30:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:30:37):**  a two minute walk away and it's just amazing.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:30:41):**  But um, but yeah, so there's, yeah, we've got quite the community.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:30:45):**  And people spend their time in really different ways depending on what they're doing.  
**[0:30:55-0:31:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:30:55):**  So to me during the green season, I spend time gardening.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:31:02):**  I spend time maintaining the wild here at our homestead, which you know, initially was  
**[0:31:12-0:31:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:31:12):**  a pretty damaged forest.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:31:14):**  And so we've been, it had been a dairy farm like 40 years ago and then grown up from a  
**[0:31:18-0:31:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:31:18):**  dairy farm.

**[0:31:25-0:31:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:31:25):**  really enjoys having help in that direction.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:31:29):**  And then also going to the deep woods.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:31:31):**  I really still need to go to the wild to get that, get that piece of myself fulfilled.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:31:39):**  So that's, that's big.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:31:41):**  And then I teach a lot during the, during the summer months and teaching like 80 hours  
**[0:31:45-0:31:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:31:45):**  a month or something.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:31:46):**  So that's a big piece of it and spending time with my family and preparing and preserving  
**[0:31:52-0:31:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:31:52):**  food.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:31:53):**  So that's, that's a lot of my time during the summer months.  
**[0:31:55-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:31:55):**  In the winter months I am doing a lot of, um, you know, dealing with fires and wood  
**[0:32:05-0:32:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:32:05):**  storage and all that good stuff, which is awesome.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:32:09):**  And then preserving food or I guess preparing food during the winter more.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:32:15):**  And I do, honestly, I mean, this is really funny.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:32:19):**  People don't think of this as being a big part of my life, but I do a fair amount of  
**[0:32:23-0:32:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:32:23):**  office work and administration during the winter to help keep the school running.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:32:28):**  So that's a, that's a big piece.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:32:31):**  And um, and reaching out and, and just communicating with other people like doing this podcast.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:32:38):**  And so that's a big part of my winter time.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:32:40):**  Um, my partner used to be, you know, we, we connected because actually he worked for Firefly.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:32:49):**  Um, but he was really into, uh, permaculture and really into forest gardening.  
**[0:32:56-0:32:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:32:56):**  And we geeked out on that together a lot when we first got together.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:32:59):**  But now he's, he's an astrologer and he's so into it and he's really into also, um,  
**[0:33:06-0:33:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:33:06):**  mythology and he's, he's writing a book on Gilgamesh right now.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:33:09):**  So that's his thing.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:33:11):**  Um, but he occasionally has this part where he comes out and does, does a bunch of, does  
**[0:33:16-0:33:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:33:16):**  a bunch of land work, but it's pretty funny.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:33:19):**  And then, uh, my, the people who live here, um, the apprentices are really focused.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:33:29):**  Like they have a curriculum and I, myself and Frank, my partner, um, help guide them  
**[0:33:35-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:33:35):**  in this process of deep reconnection and learning or skills.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:33:41):**  And so basically they're, you know, 40 hours a week, like reading, um, working on a naturalist  
**[0:33:49-0:33:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:33:49):**  notebook, working in the apprentice garden, doing, um, doing all these reconnection activities  
**[0:33:58-0:33:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:33:58):**  and writing.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:33:59):**  And so they're, and going to classes.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:34:01):**  So they're really focused on that.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:34:03):**  Um, and then we have a perennial caretaker who, who really takes care of a lot of our  
**[0:34:09-0:34:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:34:09):**  perennials and they live here just during the green season.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:34:13):**  And um, yeah, so that's, and then there's one other person who lives here who does a  
**[0:34:22-0:34:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:34:22):**  lot of our graphic design and videography and stuff like that.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:34:25):**  So she does that and then she's just stoked to be living in the woods.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:34:29):**  So that's her, that's her thing.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:34:32):**  So let's talk now a little bit about kind of how things are divided up because that's  
**[0:34:37-0:34:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:34:37):**  one of the things I find that people don't have a good idea about when they are idealizing  
**[0:34:42-0:34:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:34:42):**  sort of a homesteading lifestyle.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:34:44):**  Um, what are some of the main things that you and your family dedicate most of your  
**[0:34:49-0:34:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:34:49):**  time to and is it towards sort of a larger ambition of self sustainability or a self  
**[0:34:56-0:35:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:34:56):**  reliance or do you really kind of factor in the larger community like you've talked about,  
**[0:35:01-0:35:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:35:01):**  not just the people who live there, but the community kind of close around you as a big  
**[0:35:05-0:35:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:35:05):**  aspect of your resilience?  
**[0:35:07-0:35:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:35:07):**  You know, that's a really good question.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:35:09):**  So, um, at times in my life I've been much more focused specifically on self reliance.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:35:16):**  Um, and at this point, and that's been really fulfilling and a huge, huge thing for me.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:35:26):**  And at this point in my life, I'm much more focused on doing, um, on community reliance  
**[0:35:35-0:35:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:35:35):**  and resilience.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:35:37):**  And so we, um, you know, I don't have, I don't have chickens.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:35:43):**  We usually buy our eggs from our neighbor and that's awesome.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:35:49):**  And um, and I used to meet, you know, I don't know, probably 85% of my food needs, um, from  
**[0:35:58-0:36:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:35:58):**  foraging or gardening myself.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:36:00):**  And now that number has definitely gone down as I access more community networks and like  
**[0:36:08-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:36:08):**  do the things that I'm really good at and give money to friends who are really good

**[0:37:55-0:37:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:37:55):**  Because like, you know, there's no way that I can have that many people on seven acres

**[0:42:28-0:42:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:42:28):**  And you know, that works too.  
**[0:42:29-0:42:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:42:29):**  Like it's, I think a lot of it just is personal taste.  
**[0:42:35-0:42:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:42:35):**  And I think that it also, like we're really spoiled here that it's so easy to help each  
**[0:42:43-0:42:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:42:43):**  other out.  
**[0:42:45-0:42:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:42:45):**  Like we might have these small households, but we live like a five minute walk from each  
**[0:42:50-0:42:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:42:50):**  other.  
**[0:42:51-0:42:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:42:51):**  And that's really different from like, I have a lot of friends who live up in Vermont and  
**[0:42:55-0:43:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:42:55):**  you know, it's like an hour, 45 minutes to their nearest friend's house.  
**[0:43:00-0:43:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:43:00):**  And so then that means that they have to be the ones to deal with all of their own stuff  
**[0:43:06-0:43:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:43:06):**  because it just takes so long to like go to a friend's house to like preserve tomatoes  
**[0:43:12-0:43:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:43:12):**  together when, or to help each other out with firewood or whatever, when it's not even worth  
**[0:43:17-0:43:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:43:17):**  it because it's so far to go.  
**[0:43:19-0:43:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:43:19):**  And so, yeah, I just really like proximity.  
**[0:43:23-0:43:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:43:23):**  I think it's, it's huge for me personally.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:43:25):**  Well, so from my own kind of limited experience, cause I've never done anything in such a long  
**[0:43:29-0:43:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:43:29):**  term as you have or quite as extreme, like I've done, you know, living out in the middle  
**[0:43:33-0:43:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:43:33):**  of the wilderness on trail crews in the national parks before, but then we'd come back into  
**[0:43:37-0:43:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:43:37):**  town like, you know, once or twice a month.  
**[0:43:41-0:43:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:43:41):**  And I've done kind of in town homesteading operations and small community living organizations.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:43:46):**  I've done a lot of different configurations of this, just not really long term.  
**[0:43:49-0:43:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:43:49):**  And it's, you know, it's a good way to kind of figure out what works for you.  
**[0:43:52-0:43:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:43:52):**  And like you said, everybody's got kind of different necessities.  
**[0:43:56-0:44:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:43:56):**  The way I would put it is you kind of have to decide beforehand which of the things you  
**[0:44:00-0:44:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:44:00):**  care most about being self-sufficient for.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:44:03):**  And it's not always the things that people think of when, when you're homesteading, right?  
**[0:44:08-0:44:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:44:08):**  Like what you mentioned, you could be food self-sufficient, but that's really going to  
**[0:44:13-0:44:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:44:13):**  put a cap on how many people you include in that plan and how much land you're able to  
**[0:44:17-0:44:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:44:17):**  get.  
**[0:44:18-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:44:18):**  Right.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:44:19):**  But then there's other self-sufficiency like social self-sufficiency, right?  
**[0:44:21-0:44:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:44:21):**  Yeah.  
**[0:44:22-0:44:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:44:22):**  If you really don't need that community, well, it may be, it opens it up to put more effort  
**[0:44:27-0:44:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:44:27):**  into other things.  
**[0:44:28-0:44:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:44:28):**  But if you do, you're going to have to pick and choose from some of the other categories,  
**[0:44:32-0:44:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:44:32):**  but you just, you can't do it all.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:44:34):**  You can't be self-sufficient in every, every way.  
**[0:44:36-0:44:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:44:36):**  Yeah.  
**[0:44:37-0:44:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:44:37):**  And I think not feeling bad about things either.  
**[0:44:39-0:44:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:44:39):**  I mean, it's like, obviously all of us who are living this lifestyle have some motivation  
**[0:44:47-0:44:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:44:47):**  coming from like our own consciousness of the resources we're using.  
**[0:44:55-0:45:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:44:55):**  You know, I, I think that's a huge motivating factor for most of us and we're never going  
**[0:45:01-0:45:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:45:01):**  to be perfect.  
**[0:45:02-0:45:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:45:02):**  You know, like we are not placed, we work in a perfect system.  
**[0:45:05-0:45:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:45:05):**  The deck is stacked against you at least in some categories.  
**[0:45:08-0:45:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:45:08):**  Exactly.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:45:09):**  And so I think just staying positive is just really important.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:45:12):**  I agree.  
**[0:45:13-0:45:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:45:13):**  Cause it can be so easy to get burned out and then despair and then stop trying.  
**[0:45:17-0:45:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:45:17):**  I find that to be the biggest trap where it's like, well, I can't do some of these things  
**[0:45:22-0:45:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:45:22):**  that I really wanted to, at least not all the way, not to the, you know, the maximum  
**[0:45:26-0:45:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:45:26):**  that I would have dreamed about.  
**[0:45:28-0:45:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:45:28):**  And so you start to despair and you just kind of become apathetic about the whole process  
**[0:45:31-0:45:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:45:31):**  and man, that can kind of spiral.  
**[0:45:35-0:45:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:45:35):**  Definitely.

**[0:45:41-0:45:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:45:41):**  come from and, and the way things are situated, the community, the level of self-sufficiency  
**[0:45:48-0:45:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:45:48):**  you currently have, it gives us a really good picture of like how to put this in context.  
**[0:45:52-0:45:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:45:52):**  And so one of my last questions here would be looking to, to dedicate your time to the  
**[0:45:59-0:46:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:45:59):**  things that you most care about or, or moving forward with the project.  
**[0:46:04-0:46:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:46:04):**  What do you most want to continue to develop or fine tune in the system that you've built  
**[0:46:08-0:46:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:46:08):**  so far?  
**[0:46:11-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:46:11):**  I would say that our perennial plantings, like all of our fruit and nut trees, I think  
**[0:46:21-0:46:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:46:21):**  that I've done a lot of experimentation taking, you know, gummy berries and paw paws and mulberries  
**[0:46:32-0:46:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:46:32):**  and all these, a lot of, a lot of trees that are not traditionally grown in this region.  
**[0:46:39-0:46:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:46:39):**  And a lot of these like quote unquote permaculture species and have tried growing them here.  
**[0:46:44-0:46:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:46:44):**  And a lot of stuff has worked and a lot of stuff hasn't worked.  
**[0:46:48-0:46:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:46:48):**  And so which is great information, you know, because I'm probably one of the first people  
**[0:46:53-0:46:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:46:53):**  growing gummy berries in North Carolina, you know.  
**[0:46:56-0:47:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:46:56):**  And so taking that information about what has worked and what's not works, because a  
**[0:47:02-0:47:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:47:02):**  lot of those trees are coming into fruitful maturity and tearing out things that aren't  
**[0:47:09-0:47:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:47:09):**  working.  
**[0:47:10-0:47:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:47:10):**  I actually just today tore out a fig tree that was planted somewhere where it fruited  
**[0:47:16-0:47:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:47:16):**  once in eight years.  
**[0:47:18-0:47:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:47:18):**  And so I determined that this does not belong here.  
**[0:47:22-0:47:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:47:22):**  And so I'm transplanting it somewhere else.  
**[0:47:24-0:47:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:47:24):**  Yeah, sometimes you got to be brutal with that tree, Ash.  
**[0:47:27-0:47:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:47:27):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah, just brutally honest with yourself.  
**[0:47:30-0:47:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:47:30):**  And so I'm probably going to be replacing about a third of my plantings with other things,  
**[0:47:41-0:47:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:47:41):**  probably in the next five years.

**[0:47:49-0:47:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:47:49):**  And I'm continuing to work with the native forest as it is, that's, that's an edge for

**[0:48:05-0:48:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:48:05):**  I think that that's, that's another big, big edge for us.  
**[0:48:12-0:48:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:48:12):**  And then there's also, it's interesting, like with my, with my, because I grow perennials,  
**[0:48:16-0:48:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:48:16):**  but I also grow annual vegetables.  
**[0:48:19-0:48:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:48:19):**  And we have a big pest and disease load here in the Southeast because we just have so much  
**[0:48:29-0:48:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:48:29):**  rain during the, I mean, that we have a lot of funguses and we have a lot of insects.

**[0:48:46-0:48:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:48:46):**  Like I'm a big mulcher, I'm really into mulching and I think that that can also contribute  
**[0:48:57-0:48:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:48:57):**  to pest load.

**[0:49:03-0:49:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:49:03):**  I was on the site because it's something that accumulates over time.  
**[0:49:07-0:49:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:49:07):**  And so looking at, you know, possibly burning some of my crop debris and maybe making bio  
**[0:49:16-0:49:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:49:16):**  jar.

**[0:49:23-0:49:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:49:23):**  I am continuing to learn and thankfully continuing to learn.

**[0:49:36-0:49:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:49:36):**  looking for possible new solutions is, I mean, things are really different living in a globalized

**[0:49:46-0:49:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:49:46):**  They're not just a local pest that, and when I talk with old timers about growing fruits  
**[0:49:50-0:49:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:49:50):**  and vegetables and they used to grow everything organically and now they're like, oh, you  
**[0:49:54-0:49:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:49:54):**  can't grow that without spray here.  
**[0:49:57-0:49:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:49:57):**  Like it's just impossible.

**[0:50:04-0:50:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:50:04):**  have many less of the wildlife that would otherwise have kept them at tolerable levels

**[0:50:12-0:50:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:50:12):**  That's very true.  
**[0:50:13-0:50:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:50:13):**  And so, yeah, it's funny because a friend of mine one time mentioned how when he was  
**[0:50:19-0:50:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:50:19):**  a kid and you drive down the road, like your windshield would get covered in bugs.  
**[0:50:24-0:50:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:50:24):**  Oh man, I always remember that too.  
**[0:50:26-0:50:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:50:26):**  And now, yeah, it's so weird.  
**[0:50:29-0:50:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:50:29):**  So weird.

**[0:50:32-0:50:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:50:32):**  Yeah, it's such a funny little thing, but it really brings it into reality.  
**[0:50:39-0:50:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:50:39):**  But yeah, so I think those are the big like fine tuning things that I'm working on now.  
**[0:50:47-0:50:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:50:47):**  And also I'm really into building.  
**[0:50:49-0:50:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:50:49):**  Like I love building.  
**[0:50:50-0:50:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:50:50):**  It's one of my huge passions and we have a lot of buildings here.  
**[0:50:56-0:50:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:50:56):**  It's really funny.

**[0:51:02-0:51:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:51:02):**  zero buildings, but now we have lots and lots and lots and lots of buildings, like over  
**[0:51:07-0:51:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:51:07):**  20.

**[0:51:13-0:51:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:51:13):**  Oh my gosh.  
**[0:51:14-0:51:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:51:14):**  You know, it's funny.  
**[0:51:17-0:51:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:51:17):**  I would say it's, we have a lot of variety.  
**[0:51:21-0:51:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:51:21):**  Lots and lots of variety.

**[0:51:25-0:51:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:51:25):**  It's a round log cabin, which I would not recommend, but was a really good learning  
**[0:51:32-0:51:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:51:32):**  experience.  
**[0:51:34-0:51:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:51:34):**  And on the log cabin, there's a, there's a straw clay addition.  
**[0:51:39-0:51:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:51:39):**  It's called light slip straw is another, is another name for that.  
**[0:51:42-0:51:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:51:42):**  It's natural building.  
**[0:51:44-0:51:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:51:44):**  And with a timber frame, I mean, we have a lot of wood here, basically.  
**[0:51:49-0:51:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:51:49):**  There's lots of trees.  
**[0:51:50-0:51:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:51:50):**  And so we mostly build with wood.  
**[0:51:51-0:51:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:51:51):**  And so there's a log cabin.  
**[0:51:53-0:51:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:51:53):**  There's a slip straw addition that's framed out with a timber frame.  
**[0:51:58-0:52:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:51:58):**  And then we have, we built the outdoor kitchen is a round log timber frame.  
**[0:52:08-0:52:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:52:08):**  So I guess, you know, a big theme is wood.  
**[0:52:11-0:52:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:52:11):**  And we've milled a lot of trees here too.  
**[0:52:13-0:52:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:52:13):**  We've done a lot of stick framing.  
**[0:52:16-0:52:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:52:16):**  And so we have several apprentice shelters, which are either, either post and beam or  
**[0:52:22-0:52:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:52:22):**  stick frames.  
**[0:52:25-0:52:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:52:25):**  And our newest building is actually we're calling it the Sun House.  
**[0:52:30-0:52:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:52:30):**  And it's this, it's the 12 by 16 passive solar building, which is really awesome.  
**[0:52:36-0:52:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:52:36):**  I've gotten more and more into passive solar over the years.  
**[0:52:38-0:52:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:52:38):**  It's just such a no brainer.  
**[0:52:41-0:52:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:52:41):**  If you can heat and cool using, using the sun.  
**[0:52:46-0:52:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:52:46):**  Yeah, especially that far north.  
**[0:52:48-0:52:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:52:48):**  Yeah.  
**[0:52:49-0:52:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:52:49):**  We're not that far north.  
**[0:52:51-0:52:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:52:51):**  I think we're actually the same latitude as Spain.  
**[0:52:56-0:52:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:52:56):**  Sure.  
**[0:52:57-0:53:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:52:57):**  But we have the Gulf Stream, at least for a while we do.  
**[0:53:00-0:53:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:53:00):**  Yeah, the Gulf Stream is such a crazy.  
**[0:53:04-0:53:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:53:04):**  I mean, yeah, we're really far north.  
**[0:53:05-0:53:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:53:05):**  But I mean, I would always try and do something with passive solar here.  
**[0:53:09-0:53:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:53:09):**  The thing is that the criteria is different.  
**[0:53:11-0:53:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:53:11):**  Your winters are a lot more extreme and we need to protect ourselves more in the summers.

**[0:54:01-0:54:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:54:01):**  taught people some of the essential skills to make that transition.

**[0:54:14-0:54:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:54:14):**  in that transition towards a either a homesteading or more self-sustainable lifestyle?  
**[0:54:20-0:54:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:54:20):**  Well, that's a really good question.  
**[0:54:22-0:54:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:54:22):**  I think that either taking classes or staying on farms or homesteads is really important  
**[0:54:35-0:54:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:54:35):**  to do one of those two things and figure out what you like and what you want before you  
**[0:54:42-0:54:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:54:42):**  buy a piece of land.  
**[0:54:43-0:54:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:54:43):**  Definitely before that stage, yeah.  
**[0:54:45-0:54:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:54:45):**  Yeah, it's huge.  
**[0:54:47-0:54:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:54:47):**  And probably before even deciding that that's what you want to do.  
**[0:54:52-0:54:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:54:52):**  And I know that it can be expensive to take classes.  
**[0:54:55-0:55:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:54:55):**  It can be expensive to, like, quit your job and go live on a farm, too, you know.  
**[0:55:00-0:55:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:55:00):**  But I think that doing those things, like, you can save so much time and so much money  
**[0:55:07-0:55:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:55:07):**  by doing the research and figuring out what you want before you actually do it.  
**[0:55:10-0:55:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:55:10):**  Yeah, it's definitely cheaper than buying a piece of land and then realizing you don't  
**[0:55:14-0:55:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:55:14):**  want to live that way.  
**[0:55:15-0:55:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:55:15):**  Yeah, definitely.

**[0:55:23-0:55:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:55:23):**  of the picture.  
**[0:55:25-0:55:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:55:25):**  And because that goes into, I think, buying honestly as little land as you can.  
**[0:55:32-0:55:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:55:32):**  Sure.

**[0:55:39-0:55:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:55:39):**  And I think that there are other valid great ways of living on the land that don't involve  
**[0:55:45-0:55:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:55:45):**  purchasing land.

**[0:55:51-0:55:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:55:51):**  be investing in a place so much.

**[0:55:55-0:55:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:55:55):**  I think it's really big.  
**[0:55:56-0:56:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:55:56):**  But if you can buy an acre of land, like, you can do a lot on an acre of land as long  
**[0:56:01-0:56:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:56:01):**  as you're not trying to keep horses or cows or...  
**[0:56:04-0:56:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:56:04):**  Oh, you can definitely grow more vegetables than you could ever consume on an acre.  
**[0:56:08-0:56:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:56:08):**  Definitely.

**[0:56:10-0:56:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:56:10):**  Not even close.  
**[0:56:11-0:56:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:56:11):**  Yeah, like a tenth of an acre you could grow more than you could eat from a garden.  
**[0:56:15-0:56:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:56:15):**  Definitely.

**[0:56:21-0:56:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:56:21):**  actually, I lived in a squat in the outskirts of Barcelona called Con Mastello.  
**[0:56:27-0:56:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:56:27):**  And it was surrounded by a mountain forest park.  
**[0:56:30-0:56:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:56:30):**  And so just like having access to public land can be really, really helpful as long as they  
**[0:56:37-0:56:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:56:37):**  don't log in or do any stupid shit.

**[0:56:41-0:56:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:56:41):**  Owning a small amount and then having access to wild land or to parks or whatever can be  
**[0:56:48-0:56:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:56:48):**  really, really helpful.

**[0:56:58-0:57:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:56:58):**  from that piece of land to a normal nine to five job?

**[0:57:05-0:57:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:57:05):**  They're like, oh, land costs half as much if I live an hour from town, but then I'm

**[0:57:14-0:57:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:57:14):**  Time is so undervalued.

**[0:57:17-0:57:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:57:17):**  And if you do the numbers and you pretend like you're paying yourself for your time  
**[0:57:22-0:57:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:57:22):**  of travel, it just becomes very obvious that that's a bad idea.  
**[0:57:28-0:57:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-things-to-consider-when-making-the-shift-to-a-homesteading-lifestyle-with-natalie-bogwalker-of-wild-abundance/#t=0:57:28):**  Oh yeah.

**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:00:00):**  This is Regenerative Skills, the podcast helping you to learn the skills and solutions to create  
**[0:00:06-0:00:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:00:06):**  an abundant and connected future.  
**[0:00:08-0:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:00:08):**  I'm your host, Oliver Goshet.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:00:13):**  A lot of people don't know this about me, but when I first started working, I didn't  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:00:18):**  flip burgers in a fast food chain or go to work for my dad, which is probably for the  
**[0:00:22-0:00:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:00:22):**  best because I don't think I'd be any good at programming databases for an insurance  
**[0:00:26-0:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:00:26):**  firm.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:00:27):**  And I'm definitely not making fun of those jobs because I later worked at a movie theater  
**[0:00:30-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:00:30):**  and as a balloon boy at a party goods store.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:00:33):**  But no, one of my first jobs instead was working with the local elementary school's before  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:00:38):**  and after school program for the kids whose parents had to drop them off early or pick  
**[0:00:42-0:00:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:00:42):**  them up late after work.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:00:44):**  I loved that job so much that I later went on to work at a guest ranch in Colorado and  
**[0:00:48-0:00:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:00:48):**  then at a summer camp in Tennessee thinking that I might one day study to be a teacher  
**[0:00:53-0:00:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:00:53):**  or an educator and turn it into a career.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:00:56):**  Especially in the later jobs when I would take kids out for rides on horses or to see  
**[0:01:02-0:01:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:01:02):**  a few of the farm animals that we had on the ranch or later in Tennessee teaching the campers  
**[0:01:06-0:01:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:01:06):**  how to build a fire and to identify plants in the woods and how to avoid ticks and poison  
**[0:01:11-0:01:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:01:11):**  ivy on our hikes.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:01:12):**  It was really incredible to see as these children, many of which came from cities and suburbs  
**[0:01:17-0:01:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:01:17):**  and didn't spend a whole lot of time out in the wilderness, they started to discover new  
**[0:01:21-0:01:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:01:21):**  ways to interact with the natural world and look beyond the green sea of leaves to the  
**[0:01:27-0:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:01:27):**  individual plants and what they knew about them.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:01:31):**  Anyway, years later when I lived in Portland, Oregon, a close friend of mine volunteered  
**[0:01:37-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:01:37):**  at a local school teaching a garden program and invited me to come along to help her out.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:01:42):**  And after just one of those classes helping the kids to plant veggie starts and weed some  
**[0:01:47-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:01:47):**  parsnip beds, I was completely hooked again.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:01:51):**  Just seeing the excitement and watching the discovery was infectious and it got me excited  
**[0:01:55-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:01:55):**  about gardening all over again.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:01:57):**  And I went back to help out for a couple of months and ever since then I've been thinking  
**[0:02:00-0:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:02:00):**  of ways that I could work with kids in gardening and environmental education again.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:02:06):**  And that's why for this week's episode I reached out to Casey Rae Christopher, the author of  
**[0:02:10-0:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:02:10):**  the new book The School Garden Curriculum.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:02:13):**  Now Casey is the volunteer farm and garden educator for Oregon's Red Band Ranch.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:02:18):**  She was previously the school garden coordinator for the Springwater Environmental Sciences  
**[0:02:22-0:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:02:22):**  School and the outdoor educator for ERA.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:02:26):**  Her passion is fostering a healthy land ethic, personal empowerment, and environmental literacy  
**[0:02:32-0:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:02:32):**  in children of all ages through outdoor immersion and skill building.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:02:37):**  As a bonus for today's episode I'm actually going to be giving a free copy away of the  
**[0:02:40-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:02:40):**  book The School Garden Curriculum to a lucky member of our Discord channel.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:02:45):**  All you need to be eligible to win is to send me a message via Discord and if you win I'll  
**[0:02:49-0:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:02:49):**  either send out a hard copy of the book if you live in the US or Canada, or a digital  
**[0:02:54-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:02:54):**  copy right to your inbox if you live anywhere else in the world.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:02:58):**  But anyway today we're going to break down what it takes to get a school garden program  
**[0:03:02-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:03:02):**  started if this is something that you feel passionate about too, how to overcome some  
**[0:03:06-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:03:06):**  of the common hurdles and the pushback to keeping it running, we're going to explore  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:03:10):**  some of the lesson plans to get you started, and to challenge you to push the boundaries  
**[0:03:15-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:03:15):**  of what a school garden program can be, and the subjects that you can explore with a garden  
**[0:03:20-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:03:20):**  classroom.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:03:21):**  So Casey, to get us started with realistic expectations, what advice would you give to  
**[0:03:26-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:03:26):**  someone who's looking to reach out to a school to start a garden education program?  
**[0:03:31-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:03:31):**  Yeah, I've thought about this, because every school is so different, and every school culture  
**[0:03:38-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:03:38):**  is unique, and I've been fortunate enough to be invited into schools that want me there,  
**[0:03:44-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:03:44):**  or who want to have a garden, or who encourage it, and so that's definitely something that  
**[0:03:51-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:03:51):**  I've been blessed to have in any school, to go and kind of start developing a relationship  
**[0:03:59-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:03:59):**  with it, with a garden project in mind, or a garden program in mind.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:04:03):**  I think there's a few entry points.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:04:07):**  One of them I was thinking about was connecting to what already exists, you know, rather than  
**[0:04:13-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:04:13):**  reinventing the wheel, just seeing what's already in place, and how a garden can interact  
**[0:04:19-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:04:19):**  with that, or how a garden program can interact.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:04:23):**  You know, when I started teaching at that school, the garden was just a mess of weeds  
**[0:04:29-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:04:29):**  fenced in, and that was being watered, and there was a lot of hopeless language being  
**[0:04:36-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:04:36):**  used in the school around it.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:04:38):**  And so what we did was start, you know, they had like a regular fall harvest festival,  
**[0:04:44-0:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:04:44):**  or just a fall festival at the school, and they had a spring one.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:04:47):**  And so even though I didn't have a garden really to teach or invite people into, I was  
**[0:04:52-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:04:52):**  setting up a booth and talking to them about gardening, and offering food from local farms,  
**[0:04:57-0:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:04:57):**  and just starting to have a conversation that used more positive language, and also the  
**[0:05:03-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:05:03):**  way to introduce myself and what I wanted to do.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:05:07):**  And so I think just working within like the already established celebrations and community  
**[0:05:15-0:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:05:15):**  events is a wonderful way to start that and develop those relationships, because to have  
**[0:05:22-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:05:22):**  a garden program at a school, you need a community, and to be really to make it sustainable.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:05:29):**  And so to just introduce yourself that way is a wonderful entry way.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:05:36):**  There's also, you know, sometimes when I've come to people with projects or programs in  
**[0:05:42-0:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:05:42):**  mind, they hear science and permaculture, and they're like, oh, we need to go talk to  
**[0:05:45-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:05:45):**  the science teacher, you need to talk to this person.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:05:48):**  But really, there's that social emotional aspect, and that is really key.  
**[0:05:55-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:05:55):**  And another entry point is like with a counselor, or if there's a wellness committee, you know,  
**[0:06:03-0:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:06:03):**  there's ways of kind of just like shifting the language of introducing a program of,  
**[0:06:08-0:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:06:08):**  you know, the like the permaculture and the education aspect can come under the guise  
**[0:06:14-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:06:14):**  of other aspects that we know that it's going to happen in a garden program.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:06:20):**  So school counselors are a great way.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:06:23):**  And then these are usually one teacher or two teachers there who really want like I  
**[0:06:29-0:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:06:29):**  never didn't want to be outside with their students.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:06:32):**  I've never really met a school that doesn't have a teacher like that.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:06:37):**  And I think that's why showing up at a school and getting familiar with the people and the  
**[0:06:42-0:06:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:06:42):**  change makers and the people who get stuff done and the people who say yes, but don't  
**[0:06:47-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:06:47):**  show up and kind of just learning to identify community members and teachers is another  
**[0:06:51-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:06:51):**  great way to to start engaging with a school.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:06:56):**  Because then you can kind of find those those teachers who will bring their students out  
**[0:07:00-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:07:00):**  who are willing to collaborate.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:07:01):**  And those are all good entry ways, I think, into schools.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:07:06):**  Now, I know that all schools are different and they have their own regulations, their  
**[0:07:10-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:07:10):**  culture, their standards, and especially their own budget.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:07:13):**  And to get us started with realistic expectations, what advice would you give to someone who's  
**[0:07:19-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:07:19):**  looking to reach out to a school to start a garden education program?  
**[0:07:24-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:07:24):**  I have to say so like budgeting wise, I never had a budget.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:07:29):**  So I was just getting donations, learning how to write grants.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:07:36):**  And so I never really had to justify my expenses in that in that way, because I never had that  
**[0:07:45-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:07:45):**  support until later.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:07:48):**  And I that actually made me rely a lot more on my community and be much more engaged with  
**[0:07:55-0:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:07:55):**  my community because I needed to pool our resources.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:07:59):**  And I think it was actually it was beneficial for me as an educator, but also in that community  
**[0:08:05-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:08:05):**  building aspect to not have that.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:08:10):**  Other kind of difficulties to overcome.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:08:15):**  You know, some I think about how some people find outdoor spaces to be very unsafe.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:08:22):**  And it can be very uncomfortable for parents to have their children in outdoor spaces and  
**[0:08:29-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:08:29):**  gardens where maybe the plants are blocking viewpoint and children can kind of hide a  
**[0:08:38-0:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:08:38):**  little bit, things like that.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:08:39):**  I've had conversations with parents and community members who are a little concerned about the  
**[0:08:44-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:08:44):**  safety aspect.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:08:45):**  And that just requires a conversation and then also more dedication to student safety  
**[0:08:54-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:08:54):**  and what that looks like.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:08:57):**  And so I never I don't think I found a barrier that couldn't be solved through community  
**[0:09:05-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:09:05):**  support and open, vulnerable conversations that invite people in to the space and to  
**[0:09:14-0:09:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:09:14):**  hear their concerns.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:09:16):**  That's great advice for starting just about any community program.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:09:21):**  Getting to know people in projects that are already established and striving to build  
**[0:09:24-0:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:09:24):**  off of that success and complement those efforts is a powerful gesture of respect to those  
**[0:09:30-0:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:09:30):**  who already worked hard to move things forward.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:09:35):**  Back when I worked with children, I was always challenged by trying to organize activities  
**[0:09:40-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:09:40):**  and design lessons and tasks that would be engaging for a range of age groups and skill  
**[0:09:44-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:09:44):**  levels because the problem would often come that say the little ones were having fun and  
**[0:09:49-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:09:49):**  could keep up, but the older kids were getting bored or the opposite would come up and the  
**[0:09:53-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:09:53):**  older kids were challenged, but the younger kids struggled to keep up and resorted to  
**[0:09:57-0:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:09:57):**  distracting themselves with other tasks.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:09:59):**  Yes.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:10:00):**  Yeah, that was that was a learning curve for me was realizing that and understanding how  
**[0:10:06-0:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:10:06):**  to engage it.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:10:07):**  You know, when I was working with K through eight, I kind of felt like they came full  
**[0:10:10-0:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:10:10):**  circle behavior wise, like the kindergartners would evolve and they're probably at their  
**[0:10:16-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:10:16):**  highest level of behavior evolution in fourth grade and then they would go back to kindergarten  
**[0:10:20-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:10:20):**  by eighth grade.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:10:21):**  And I had to take a similar approach of simple instructions, quick lessons, lots of physical  
**[0:10:29-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:10:29):**  activity between kindergarten and eighth grade because they were kind of at the same level  
**[0:10:34-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:10:34):**  again.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:10:35):**  But one thing that I found to be really successful that I think is a little underrated with with  
**[0:10:42-0:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:10:42):**  programs that I've seen is just repeating tasks each season, but building off of the  
**[0:10:48-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:10:48):**  complexity of those tasks and I think just planting pea seeds with kindergartners, you  
**[0:10:55-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:10:55):**  know, they're nice, big seeds.  
**[0:10:56-0:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:10:56):**  They're easy to handle.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:10:58):**  Just take a lot of work for kindergarten and a lot of motor skills that go into planting  
**[0:11:04-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:11:04):**  a seed.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:11:05):**  But an older student can still do that, but instead they can be also learning about root  
**[0:11:10-0:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:11:10):**  systems, nitrogen fixation, trellising.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:11:14):**  There's just so many things that can be learned off of that same task.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:11:18):**  It's just that the conversation that you're having and the questions that you're asking  
**[0:11:22-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:11:22):**  develop in their complexity and they do respect the skill development of those students.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:11:32):**  And so that's one thing that I've kept in mind is like not downplaying the repeated  
**[0:11:38-0:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:11:38):**  task each season.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:11:40):**  Each one is an opportunity to kind of judge and evaluate student knowledge and then to  
**[0:11:46-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:11:46):**  build off of that.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:11:49):**  The other thing that I've done specifically around permaculture is like there's just so  
**[0:11:55-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:11:55):**  many valuable lessons that come with permaculture, but the language access is really difficult  
**[0:12:01-0:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:12:01):**  for younger students.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:12:02):**  You know, you can throw out words like edge effect and they don't understand.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:12:10):**  But you can teach it to them in a very conceptual way or you can have them engaging with it.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:12:16):**  And then what I've done is like I have them engage with them when they're younger and  
**[0:12:20-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:12:20):**  then when they're older, I'm like, oh, that thing that you've been doing for years, that's  
**[0:12:23-0:12:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:12:23):**  actually called this.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:12:24):**  And you've been doing it and you know it and you have years of experience now and kind  
**[0:12:30-0:12:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:12:30):**  of introducing that language when they're older so that they can really start to not  
**[0:12:34-0:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:12:34):**  only grasp the concept, but own it because they've been doing it for so long and then  
**[0:12:40-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:12:40):**  to start using that language to build their own lesson plans or start to develop their  
**[0:12:46-0:12:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:12:46):**  own projects with that language in mind.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:12:49):**  So I think even there's like the language introduction that changes, you know, the younger  
**[0:12:54-0:13:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:12:54):**  students it's very much just experiencing for me and the older students it's really  
**[0:13:00-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:13:00):**  starting to name and grasp the larger concepts and systems that work.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:13:06):**  This range of teaching possibilities is fascinating to me and opens up so many possibilities,  
**[0:13:11-0:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:13:11):**  even for adults.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:13:13):**  But for people who don't have experience creating lesson plans around gardening, it can be a  
**[0:13:17-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:13:17):**  bit daunting to get started.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:13:20):**  It's worth starting slow and getting a few fundamentals across sometimes before even  
**[0:13:24-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:13:24):**  going outside, especially in those cold months when there's really not that much going on  
**[0:13:28-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:13:28):**  in the plant world.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:13:29):**  I want to say the winter gardening lessons are probably a great place to start because  
**[0:13:35-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:13:35):**  they don't require an outdoor space typically.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:13:39):**  Like most of my winter lessons are all indoors.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:13:43):**  They're made for window boxes or just windows inside and they teach more about the concept  
**[0:13:53-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:13:53):**  of gardening or they're mostly experimental.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:13:56):**  So it's a chance for students and adults alike to start to get familiar with the language  
**[0:14:04-0:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:14:04):**  and the processes but also kind of the beauty of, I don't want to say failure, but it just  
**[0:14:14-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:14:14):**  starts getting them used to things dying and experiments not being the success that we  
**[0:14:20-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:14:20):**  want them to.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:14:21):**  I think it's a good chance to practice giving up the expectations that certain people have  
**[0:14:28-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:14:28):**  of gardens.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:14:29):**  There's a lot of pressure in the spring and the fall, but especially the spring with planting  
**[0:14:35-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:14:35):**  season to plant so many seeds and it's going to grow all of this food and it's just going  
**[0:14:42-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:14:42):**  to look beautiful and it's going to look this way and we're going to have all of this bounty.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:14:46):**  And that's not, as gardeners like that, that doesn't always happen because of environmental  
**[0:14:52-0:14:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:14:52):**  factors or social factors or germination.  
**[0:14:55-0:15:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:14:55):**  There's just so many variables at work and it can be really difficult for children especially  
**[0:15:00-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:15:00):**  to have all that expectation and then to not see it happen, not see whatever stories they've  
**[0:15:08-0:15:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:15:08):**  come up with about the garden come true or about their plants or the seeds that they  
**[0:15:12-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:15:12):**  put in the soil.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:15:13):**  And so the winter is a great time and I think any of my winter gardening activities, but  
**[0:15:19-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:15:19):**  especially for like the kindergarteners and first graders, it's just a good place for  
**[0:15:23-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:15:23):**  any beginning gardener no matter their age to get started because they get to sprout  
**[0:15:29-0:15:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:15:29):**  seeds and then they get to take the sprouts out of the soil and really look at the structures  
**[0:15:35-0:15:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:15:35):**  of the roots and there's no expectation around production.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:15:42):**  It's all about observation and wonder and asking questions.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:15:47):**  And I think those are the most valuable traits to have in any garden and any garden program.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:15:51):**  And so that's where I would start is just experimenting indoors asking questions and  
**[0:15:59-0:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:15:59):**  seeing what happens.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:16:01):**  Can you give me an example of one of your favorite experiments indoors?  
**[0:16:05-0:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:16:05):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:16:06):**  Gosh, you know, I don't even think I have this in my book.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:16:12):**  I think it was a lesson plan that I cut out, but it-  
**[0:16:14-0:16:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:16:14):**  Oh good, we get bonus material here.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:16:16):**  Oh my gosh, there's so much.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:16:21):**  But really it's like anytime just planting a seed on a window seal and watching it grow  
**[0:16:25-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:16:25):**  is it's so simple and it can be so valuable to go back and check in on it and, you know,  
**[0:16:35-0:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:16:35):**  do logs of plant growth.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:16:37):**  But I had one time I had a class, they were doing a space unit and learning about astronauts  
**[0:16:44-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:16:44):**  and I was trying really hard to make a garden connection.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:16:48):**  So I was like, okay, we will grow these seeds inside and then we'll grow them in different  
**[0:16:54-0:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:16:54):**  conditions.  
**[0:16:55-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:16:55):**  So like we'll have some seeds grow in all darkness with limited light.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:17:00):**  You know, they get a little bit of light for the day and then they get kind of closed up  
**[0:17:04-0:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:17:04):**  under, I think I just had cups, you know, I didn't really have a lot of, you know, technical  
**[0:17:10-0:17:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:17:10):**  material which is what I had on hand.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:17:12):**  And others grew in, you know, like pumice that I had on here or perlite that I had on  
**[0:17:20-0:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:17:20):**  hand.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:17:21):**  And like, so they kind of grew in rocks, the substrates and some grew in soil and some  
**[0:17:24-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:17:24):**  grew in water and some grew in full light and soil and just comparing the plant growth  
**[0:17:29-0:17:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:17:29):**  in different mediums that the kids came up with.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:17:34):**  And it was messy and it was funny and it wasn't the most successful lesson I had.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:17:39):**  And it really didn't connect to the space unit.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:17:43):**  But it was really fun to watch because they could, it was, again, it was just all exploration.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:17:52):**  And kids were excited to see each day what was happening to the seeds and to check in  
**[0:17:55-0:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:17:55):**  on them and to compare the growth rates and what was happening to some plants over others.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:18:03):**  And I was even surprised by how successful some plants were in weird conditions.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:18:07):**  And, you know, that's my favorite really is just is the comparisons, I think.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:18:15):**  And I know that there's lessons like that.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:18:17):**  I think all of my winter lessons have something like that where you're comparing growth rates  
**[0:18:24-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:18:24):**  to different plants.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:18:25):**  And it's my favorite because that's where the questions start coming.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:18:31):**  And that's so key to get students engaged and developing ownership and wonder.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:18:39):**  And I think that's the simplest place to start.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:18:43):**  And from those simple starting points opens up a world of living analogies and comparisons,  
**[0:18:48-0:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:18:48):**  even to those theoretical lessons and concepts that I always remember complaining about when  
**[0:18:52-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:18:52):**  I was in school, whining about how I'd never used those math formulas in real life or how  
**[0:18:57-0:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:18:57):**  I couldn't envision needing to know trigonometry in the future.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:19:01):**  In my experience, especially having, like I'm thinking specifically about an onsite  
**[0:19:05-0:19:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:19:05):**  garden or even container gardens, like a regular place for children to go to and return to  
**[0:19:11-0:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:19:11):**  to just interact with any garden space.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:19:15):**  I mean, those spaces can not only enhance what they're learning in the classroom.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:19:21):**  You know, one of my favorite things was to go in and have conversations with teachers  
**[0:19:26-0:19:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:19:26):**  about what they were teaching and then connect it to the garden in a way so the kids are  
**[0:19:31-0:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:19:31):**  actually having these hands on interactions with like, I remember we did electricity once  
**[0:19:38-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:19:38):**  and I was like, how am I supposed to do electricity as a garden connection?  
**[0:19:42-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:19:42):**  And it ended up being a great connection with compost and energy cycles and energy transfers.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:19:49):**  And so there's a lot of creativity there that it just provides another lens for the children  
**[0:19:57-0:20:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:19:57):**  to make connections or like another lens for them to see their studies that they're in  
**[0:20:03-0:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:20:03):**  the classroom and to kind of have that kinesthetic engagement that they desperately need.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:20:10):**  I think that's the other part is that so many of our students and our children are in very,  
**[0:20:16-0:20:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:20:16):**  very, they're not moving during the day.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:20:20):**  Like, they're just they're, they're lacking that.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:20:23):**  And so, you know, the the electricity unit like that was just an excuse to get them moving,  
**[0:20:30-0:20:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:20:30):**  really.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:20:31):**  The academic ties is kind of just what I used to convince their teacher to let them come  
**[0:20:36-0:20:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:20:36):**  outside.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:20:37):**  So I had to ask, for someone who's created over 200 lesson plans for garden and permaculture  
**[0:20:42-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:20:42):**  education for kids in this book, do you have a personal favorite lesson to teach?  
**[0:20:47-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:20:47):**  I feel like my favorite is a little different than what a beginning gardener or garden educator  
**[0:20:54-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:20:54):**  would want.  
**[0:20:55-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:20:55):**  I mean, my favorite unit is the vermicomposting unit.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:20:59):**  Sure.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:21:00):**  It's just it's so much fun.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:21:02):**  And it's probably the biggest empathy builder for students.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:21:06):**  Where they learn to really have an emotional connection to worms and it's just beautiful.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:21:15):**  And then, you know, through worms, extended to the entire ecosystem that they're interacting  
**[0:21:21-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:21:21):**  with.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:21:22):**  So that's my favorite, but I don't know if it's the best for a beginning person because  
**[0:21:28-0:21:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:21:28):**  worms are just very needy pets sometimes.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:21:32):**  There are really so many directions you can take the learning journey in a setting as  
**[0:21:36-0:21:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:21:36):**  simple as a little veggie garden.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:21:38):**  I really loved when Casey brought up the connection she makes to the larger role and potential  
**[0:21:43-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:21:43):**  that humans can have when they learn to respect their places as stewards and collaborators  
**[0:21:47-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:21:47):**  with nature rather than the controlling force that drives an agenda.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:21:51):**  It is.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:21:52):**  It is because there's so much about modern gardening and farming that's egocentric and  
**[0:21:59-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:21:59):**  it puts human interaction as the primary force in a garden.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:22:04):**  Whereas we know that that's not true at all.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:22:08):**  And so that's one thing that I've that's the conversation piece when I'm with children  
**[0:22:15-0:22:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:22:15):**  and I try to take every opportunity I can to have these conversations with them is just  
**[0:22:20-0:22:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:22:20):**  what's happening already.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:22:21):**  Like just look at what is what is already occurring and what already exists and what's  
**[0:22:27-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:22:27):**  already interacting with each other and relationships that are already being built without human  
**[0:22:33-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:22:33):**  interaction.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:22:34):**  And then the why.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:22:35):**  Like a lot of students that I work with have preconceived notions of how they should interact  
**[0:22:41-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:22:41):**  with the garden or what they should do if they see a slug.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:22:44):**  Like we have to kill it or we have to salt it or like oh that's a gross thing over there.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:22:50):**  And it's like well why?  
**[0:22:52-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:22:52):**  And I guess the biggest question is you know where are these ideas coming from?  
**[0:22:57-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:22:57):**  And I know where they're coming from.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:22:58):**  They're parroting their parents or things that they've heard or seen.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:23:03):**  And really cutting to the heart of that is just like trying to create a sense or inspire  
**[0:23:11-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:23:11):**  a sense of the self in relation to that ecosystem.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:23:16):**  And then what is our responsibility to it in interacting?  
**[0:23:22-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:23:22):**  What does that interaction look like?  
**[0:23:25-0:23:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:23:25):**  So now that we've got some of the practical steps explained and some resources to draw  
**[0:23:29-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:23:29):**  from, I wanted to explore some of my own favorite things about the joys of working with children  
**[0:23:34-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:23:34):**  and watching the learning process and their personal growth evolve over time.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:23:39):**  Now I didn't stay with those jobs that I mentioned in the beginning long enough to really observe  
**[0:23:44-0:23:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:23:44):**  this.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:23:45):**  And I don't have any kids of my own.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:23:46):**  But watching my nieces and nephew grow up have really shown me what a magical journey  
**[0:23:51-0:23:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:23:51):**  of discovery and learning this can be.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:23:53):**  Not only for the children, but for us grumpy grown-ups who often lose sight of the miracle  
**[0:23:58-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:23:58):**  of nature as we get caught up in other worries and priorities.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:24:02):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:24:03):**  There's one particular class that's dear to my heart because of that reason.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:24:09):**  It was my... when I started teaching at this environmental science school, they were the  
**[0:24:14-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:24:14):**  first grade class and then I was there for about five years.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:24:18):**  And so I got to see them from being six and seven year olds to being teenagers.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:24:24):**  And what I noticed was, I mean, they already had an affinity for the garden and they helped  
**[0:24:30-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:24:30):**  me develop it from the beginning stages.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:24:32):**  You know, they're little first graders with giant shovels digging out pathways for me.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:24:37):**  And they just went with it with just wholeheartedly.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:24:41):**  And as a class and as a community, they were really strong and carrying that passion through  
**[0:24:48-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:24:48):**  those five years.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:24:50):**  And from the beginning stages of...  
**[0:24:54-0:24:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:24:54):**  I mostly focused on behavior.  
**[0:24:56-0:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:24:56):**  This is how we treat each other.  
**[0:24:58-0:24:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:24:58):**  This is how we treat the land.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:24:59):**  This is how we treat ourselves.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:25:00):**  And really just trying to model that behavior and practice it with them.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:25:05):**  I noticed that by the fifth year I had my last gardening class with them, which was  
**[0:25:12-0:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:25:12):**  really bittersweet because they were just so dear to me.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:25:14):**  I gave them...  
**[0:25:15-0:25:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:25:15):**  I think we were doing plants.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:25:17):**  Like we were doing tulip bulbs, we were planting.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:25:20):**  And I didn't really need to teach them at all.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:25:22):**  Like I gave them the tools and I had them recall how deep to plant certain seeds.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:25:29):**  And then they just went off and did it.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:25:32):**  And what I noticed was it was just their behavior.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:25:35):**  It was exactly what a gardener should...  
**[0:25:39-0:25:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:25:39):**  If I could have an ideal gardener, it would be thoughtful interaction, quiet voices.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:25:46):**  They were very conscientious of the fact that they were in an ecosystem and that they were  
**[0:25:51-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:25:51):**  both a part of it and visiting other's homes.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:25:54):**  They were giving each other certain space and talking to each other in certain ways.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:25:59):**  And it was just this... it was everything that I had dreamed of five years before.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:26:07):**  And that's really what gave me hope was like they're not going to remember all of the details  
**[0:26:13-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:26:13):**  of planting or all of the technicalities of gardening, but they internalize the social  
**[0:26:19-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:26:19):**  aspects that I really...  
**[0:26:23-0:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:26:23):**  I thought the garden really was there to teach was how to be a community.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:26:30):**  And they just embodied that in such a beautiful way that I just stood there and just watched  
**[0:26:34-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:26:34):**  them.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:26:35):**  And I was filled with so much hope for the future.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:26:40):**  And it really...  
**[0:26:42-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:26:42):**  I feel like, I mean, I had faith that the work that I was doing and the teaching around  
**[0:26:47-0:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:26:47):**  behaviors was going to pay off, but to see it in action was just a mind-blowing moment.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:26:52):**  I really hope that the practical steps that Casey's insights into the world of garden  
**[0:26:58-0:27:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:26:58):**  and environmental education for children has inspired you as much as it has for me.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:27:03):**  While I continue to look for the best way to share my love of the natural world with  
**[0:27:07-0:27:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:27:07):**  younger generations, I want to pose a couple of questions to you, even if you're not thinking  
**[0:27:12-0:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:27:12):**  of getting involved in a school garden program.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:27:16):**  First off, how important is it to teach earth stewardship to children, and at what age should  
**[0:27:21-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:27:21):**  they get started?  
**[0:27:23-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:27:23):**  And number two, are there ways that you can help to guide and inform the children in your  
**[0:27:27-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-a-school-garden-program/#t=0:27:27):**  life through the natural world around them, and how to have a beneficial impact on it?

### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 28 May 2021 06:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:00:00):**  This is Regenerative Skills, the podcast helping you to learn the skills and solutions to create  
**[0:00:06-0:00:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:00:06):**  an abundant and connected future.  
**[0:00:08-0:00:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:00:08):**  I'm your host, Oliver Gautier.  
**[0:00:11-0:00:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:00:11):**  There's two quick things that I want to mention before we get to the interview.  
**[0:00:15-0:00:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:00:15):**  The first is that these skill calls are a new feature of the show that I'll be running  
**[0:00:19-0:00:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:00:19):**  with climate farmers in our ongoing effort to support and promote regenerative agriculture  
**[0:00:23-0:00:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:00:23):**  in Europe and are now going to be offered live every two weeks.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:00:28):**  These calls will feature interviews and presentations from experts and innovators in farming from  
**[0:00:32-0:00:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:00:32):**  around the world, but beyond the people that we feature and the topics that we cover, there  
**[0:00:37-0:00:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:00:37):**  are also extended listener questions and discussion sessions at the end that I won't be publishing  
**[0:00:43-0:00:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:00:43):**  either on the podcast nor on the YouTube channel.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:00:46):**  And the reason for that is that we've observed that there's a reluctance in the farming  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:00:49):**  communities to openly share mistakes and difficulties in their journey with the public.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:00:54):**  And I completely understand that.  
**[0:00:55-0:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:00:55):**  I mean, there's plenty of things that I screwed up on in the business and the farm  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:00:59):**  design back when we were getting the farm set up in Guatemala, which I don't put out  
**[0:01:04-0:01:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:01:04):**  to the world.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:01:05):**  But in order for our members to feel secure in communicating honestly about the aspects  
**[0:01:09-0:01:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:01:09):**  of their lives and operations that they'd rather not show on social media and their  
**[0:01:13-0:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:01:13):**  own educational content, these sessions are always kept private.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:01:18):**  We also keep the attendance of the skill building calls capped at 25 participants per call so  
**[0:01:23-0:01:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:01:23):**  that everyone gets a chance to share and ask questions if they want.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:01:27):**  So if you're a farmer in Europe, regardless of whether you're running a regenerative,  
**[0:01:32-0:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:01:32):**  an organic or a conventional farm, we'd love to have you on a call to hear about what  
**[0:01:37-0:01:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:01:37):**  you're working on or wrestling with so that we can support you and connect you with others  
**[0:01:41-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:01:41):**  near you.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:01:42):**  We know that it can be difficult, often working in the fields alone or feeling isolated in  
**[0:01:47-0:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:01:47):**  rural areas.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:01:48):**  So come and join the Climate Farmers Network where you'll always be in good company.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:01:53):**  You can register to attend live calls through the links on our Instagram account or on their

**[0:02:01-0:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:02:01):**  Now the second opportunity I want to tell you about is that Richard Perkins, the speaker

**[0:02:11-0:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:02:11):**  farm in a new free mini-series on profitable regenerative farming which includes some great  
**[0:02:16-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:02:16):**  resources including a downloadable guide on how to build his rollaway nest boxes, an editable  
**[0:02:22-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:02:22):**  spreadsheet download of the financial modeling for his beef enterprises, and a lot more.

**[0:02:41-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:02:41):**  away.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:02:43):**  Now with those announcements out of the way, let's jump into the episode.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:02:48):**  I welcome everybody to the first of the regenerative skill building calls that I host with Climate  
**[0:02:53-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:02:53):**  Farmers, which is a new organization working to promote regenerative agriculture across  
**[0:02:57-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:02:57):**  Europe.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:02:58):**  Now these calls are specifically designed for our growing community of farmers and regenerative  
**[0:03:02-0:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:03:02):**  agriculture consultants around the continent.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:03:05):**  We listen to their interests and concerns online and then reach out to the experts who  
**[0:03:09-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:03:09):**  can best answer them and offer guidance.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:03:12):**  In order to receive invitations to participate on the live calls, you can subscribe to the  
**[0:03:16-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:03:16):**  Climate Farmers newsletter on their website, or follow the links on our Instagram and on  
**[0:03:21-0:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:03:21):**  the Regenerative Skills Discord server.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:03:24):**  Now in this first call, Richard Perkins joined us to speak about the challenges of market  
**[0:03:29-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:03:29):**  gardening.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:03:30):**  Now since Richard has almost two decades of market gardening experience, and of course  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:03:34):**  the fact that many of the farmers in our Climate Farmers network also focuses on intensive  
**[0:03:39-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:03:39):**  vegetable production, we explored the many facets of this popular agricultural enterprise.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:03:45):**  We covered preparation and planning steps for success, improving efficiency in daily  
**[0:03:49-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:03:49):**  tasks and production, marketing your products and building a loyal customer base, and that  
**[0:03:54-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:03:54):**  was all before we opened it up for listener questions.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:03:58):**  So be sure to stick around as well until the end of this episode to hear the questions  
**[0:04:01-0:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:04:01):**  that we'll be discussing on the Discord server this week.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:04:04):**  And now with all of that out of the way, let me present Richard Perkins.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:04:08):**  I'm sure many of you know his content and his work already, but Richard is the co-owner  
**[0:04:13-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:04:13):**  and director of Ridsdale Permaculture and is one of the leading experts and educators  
**[0:04:17-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:04:17):**  on small-scale, profitable, regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:04:23):**  And today we're going to be going over some of his knowledge from his own content and  
**[0:04:28-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:04:28):**  publications as well as just general advice for having been in the game for, well, you're  
**[0:04:33-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:04:33):**  getting into your eighth season on this farm now, aren't you?  
**[0:04:37-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:04:37):**  On this farm, but I've been growing vegetables for 20 years now.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:04:41):**  I went to ag school for crop production, organic crop production when I was 18.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:04:47):**  So I've been growing veg ever since then.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:04:50):**  And part of what I've learned from your content is while there are a lot of intricacies and  
**[0:04:54-0:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:04:54):**  things that are important to the context of where you're growing and how to get the ecological  
**[0:04:59-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:04:59):**  aspect of growing correct, it's one of the more straightforward processes is actually  
**[0:05:04-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:05:04):**  producing the food itself and a lot of the intricacies and a lot of the places where  
**[0:05:08-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:05:08):**  people find troubles or get kind of tripped up in the process is the business aspect and  
**[0:05:15-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:05:15):**  running all of the management in the complexity of the entire system.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:05:20):**  And so those are some of the things that came up in a lot of the feedback from our farmers  
**[0:05:24-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:05:24):**  in this network.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:05:26):**  And I've tried to compile some major, let's say categories that we're going to try to  
**[0:05:31-0:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:05:31):**  explore in the interview, and then we're going to open it up for them to ask their own specific  
**[0:05:35-0:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:05:35):**  questions in the last half hour.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:05:37):**  So if you're set, I would love to jump in to the first topic, which is planning for  
**[0:05:42-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:05:42):**  success in market gardening.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:05:47):**  And if anybody has questions throughout this interview, you can post them in the chat.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:05:53):**  I'm not going to address them until later on, and then I'll give you some more directions  
**[0:05:57-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:05:57):**  on how we can do the Q&A.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:05:58):**  But until then, let's start looking at the financial planning from the beginning that  
**[0:06:04-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:06:04):**  can set you up for success throughout the operation.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:06:07):**  Because I know that you really advocate for careful financial projections and really focusing  
**[0:06:14-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:06:14):**  on the numbers before launching into a new enterprise.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:06:20):**  Yeah, I think just to be clear, Oliver, are we having a conversation or are you giving  
**[0:06:26-0:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:06:26):**  me talking points that I go off in random directions?  
**[0:06:31-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:06:31):**  Well I know you're better at the second one.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:06:34):**  So let's do it that way, but I'll give you enough prompts to keep us somewhat reined  
**[0:06:38-0:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:06:38):**  in here.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:06:39):**  Yeah, well, what to say?  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:06:41):**  Well I guess there's a few interconnected points there.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:06:45):**  The first would be, yeah, market gardening as a whole.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:06:52):**  I want to clarify the context of how I perceive this.  
**[0:06:55-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:06:55):**  So market gardening has been the most promoted of the whole suite of regenerative ag.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:07:01):**  And I've said this many times, but I find myself pushing back against that in the sense  
**[0:07:07-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:07:07):**  that if you look at all the really famous market gardeners around the world, they're  
**[0:07:12-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:07:12):**  all market gardeners.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:07:13):**  They're not farmers.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:07:14):**  Now I'm not saying that to be critical or insulting.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:07:17):**  I'm saying nearly all the famous market gardeners you hear of don't have deep experience with  
**[0:07:23-0:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:07:23):**  other realms of farming.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:07:25):**  And so I think that the public gets a distorted view of farming through that.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:07:33):**  In this world of YouTube and memes and Instagram and blah, blah, blah, blah, and missing out  
**[0:07:39-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:07:39):**  all the details behind it.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:07:42):**  And yes, it's true that market gardening is perhaps an enterprise that it needs the least  
**[0:07:49-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:07:49):**  land.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:07:50):**  It needs the least investments.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:07:52):**  You don't need a particularly large amount of skills to get going.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:07:56):**  But the bit that's missed out is it's by far the most labor intensive of all enterprises  
**[0:08:03-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:08:03):**  you could possibly run.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:08:04):**  I mean, that was the point of my book and the comparative analysis in that was to really  
**[0:08:09-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:08:09):**  illustrate to people like, yeah, sure.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:08:12):**  This is a nice enterprise that you can set up in a tiny space.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:08:16):**  You can maybe get a few months off depending on your climate zone.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:08:19):**  And that suits a lot of young people today that want to go surfing for three months in  
**[0:08:23-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:08:23):**  Bali or whatever it is.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:08:26):**  But there are far easier ways to earn a family income on a farm.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:08:31):**  But it might.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:08:32):**  But they all look different.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:08:33):**  You know, like my hen enterprise, my egg enterprise and the same money for about.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:08:39):**  Thirty five percent of the time, but it's seven days a week and you can't miss it because  
**[0:08:44-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:08:44):**  it's livestock and it's a welfare issue.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:08:47):**  So those things need unpacking and clarifying.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:08:50):**  And I think that's been a large part of my role is to sort of push back against that  
**[0:08:56-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:08:56):**  because it's a big part of what we do.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:08:58):**  All of us, you know, is the first part of our education is holistic context and specifically  
**[0:09:05-0:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:09:05):**  talking about Alan Savory's work with holistic management and getting people super clear,  
**[0:09:11-0:09:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:09:11):**  like, what are your deepest values and why do you want to actually do this?  
**[0:09:16-0:09:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:09:16):**  Because a lot of people come to our farm with 10 years of dream of becoming a market gardener  
**[0:09:23-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:09:23):**  and then they leave and set up an amazing pasture poultry enterprise and also vice versa.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:09:29):**  You know, people's visions change when they get into contact with things directly and  
**[0:09:32-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:09:32):**  look at what day in, day out work looks like.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:09:36):**  So anyway, that's a bit of preamble because my context is heavily.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:09:44):**  I wanted to say jaded, but slanted by that because it's yeah, like, of course you can  
**[0:09:51-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:09:51):**  make an incredibly beautiful life through market gardening and many people are doing  
**[0:09:57-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:09:57):**  that, but it's it needs to be looked at.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:10:01):**  You know, we just finished running our online training that's run for the last two months  
**[0:10:06-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:10:06):**  and I've been really happy to see the amount of people who have shaved off some of the  
**[0:10:11-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:10:11):**  idealism.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:10:13):**  They get excited, like, I want to start eggmobiles and plant trees and have a market garden.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:10:18):**  It's like, well, you know, once you start a market garden to make a decent amount of  
**[0:10:24-0:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:10:24):**  income, you're pretty much tied to that.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:10:27):**  You don't have time to be running around doing other things.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:10:30):**  So it's just good to get that sort of time.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:10:35):**  It's not just looking at the finances, it's looking at the time too.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:10:39):**  So that's super important.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:10:41):**  In terms of planning for financial success, I mean, obviously you have to do detailed  
**[0:10:47-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:10:47):**  market analysis of where you are.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:10:50):**  We're working on a different level to, you know, what are our options?  
**[0:10:54-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:10:54):**  We can sell direct to consumer, we can sell in advance through CSAs, we can sell to chefs  
**[0:11:00-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:11:00):**  and restaurants, you know, or find niche markets for strange microgreens or whatever it is.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:11:08):**  And your proximity to market will obviously affect that greatly.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:11:12):**  But one early thing that we need to think about is the types of crops we grow.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:11:18):**  Now nearly every market garden that I visited that is struggling is growing a high proportion  
**[0:11:24-0:11:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:11:24):**  of very low value crops.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:11:26):**  So the first thing to think about in terms of what you grow, like a lot of people are  
**[0:11:31-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:11:31):**  influenced by what they like, not what their customers like, you know.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:11:37):**  And I grew up in the UK where early veg box schemes kind of shot themselves in the foot  
**[0:11:42-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:11:42):**  by, you know, presenting things poorly or putting five courgettes in a box in the middle  
**[0:11:49-0:11:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:11:49):**  of summer because they couldn't get rid of it.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:11:51):**  And it's like, well, who eats five courgettes in a week?  
**[0:11:53-0:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:11:53):**  You know, it doesn't make sense.  
**[0:11:55-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:11:55):**  So I feel like over the last five years or so, the level of professionalism has gone  
**[0:12:00-0:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:12:00):**  up really greatly and that's great to see.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:12:04):**  But a big analysis point would be looking at what you want to grow.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:12:07):**  So profitability is obviously a factor of how long things take to grow, how many of  
**[0:12:13-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:12:13):**  them fit in the bed, what they sell for, how long you harvest them over, whether they're  
**[0:12:17-0:12:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:12:17):**  a single harvest, multi harvest or many week harvest, and the demand for that product.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:12:24):**  And then there's obviously cultural concerns in with that too.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:12:27):**  Like cabbage is not worth a lot here, but in Germany, it might be absolutely demanded  
**[0:12:36-0:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:12:36):**  that that's part of the share or like potatoes are not worth much here.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:12:40):**  But in midsummer, new potatoes are worth a fortune, you know.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:12:45):**  So those cultural nuances are, you know, I guess obvious if you're growing up in the  
**[0:12:49-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:12:49):**  country, you know what they are naturally anyway.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:12:54):**  But when you it depends on how you're considering selling your product, how you're going to  
**[0:12:59-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:12:59):**  balance those low and high value crops, because obviously we've seen a lot of the well-known  
**[0:13:04-0:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:13:04):**  market going as you've seen people like Curtis Stone, who are living on the edge or were  
**[0:13:09-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:13:09):**  living on the edge of a city doing, you know, to a million people where you can only sell  
**[0:13:14-0:13:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:13:14):**  high value quick rotation crops.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:13:16):**  Great.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:13:17):**  But most of us aren't.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:13:18):**  And so that's not replicable.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:13:20):**  If you live in a rural setting, you can't work on that basis.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:13:24):**  Obviously, we've got highly perishable crops.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:13:26):**  So we need to think about how we're going to sell before we start anything like we can't  
**[0:13:32-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:13:32):**  make any crop plans until we think about what it is and who we're actually selling to.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:13:38):**  And then striking a good balance between high and low value crops.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:13:42):**  And inevitably, you will probably always need to grow some low value crops to have enough  
**[0:13:48-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:13:48):**  breadth of product to be unless you're aimed at totally niche markets, you will need some  
**[0:13:54-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:13:54):**  degree of diversity.  
**[0:13:57-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:13:57):**  And that's not a bad thing.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:13:59):**  And it's a question I see you had for later on, perhaps.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:14:02):**  But one thing I can really stress to folks listening is the like we have a very broad  
**[0:14:10-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:14:10):**  product portfolio.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:14:11):**  We have meat turkeys, meat, chickens, we have pork, we have beef, we have lamb, vegetables,  
**[0:14:20-0:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:14:20):**  micro greens, eggs.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:14:23):**  And that in itself is incredibly powerful as a sales tool.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:14:29):**  Like as soon as fresh chickens come along, we sell loads more vegetables.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:14:35):**  And that I always say this, but in the words of Joe Salatin, it's much easier to find 100  
**[0:14:41-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:14:41):**  customers that will spend $1,000 with you than finding 1000 customers that will spend  
**[0:14:45-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:14:45):**  $100 with you.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:14:47):**  That is totally true across the board.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:14:50):**  And so whilst I'm not saying everyone needs to go out and run diversified farms, that's  
**[0:14:55-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:14:55):**  very complex and not necessarily in everyone's context, but diversity in itself helps sell  
**[0:15:02-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:15:02):**  things.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:15:03):**  So it gives you some ability to manage cash flow and iron out the sort of economy through  
**[0:15:10-0:15:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:15:10):**  the year.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:15:12):**  So key points are like, who are you going to sell to and how, and then you can start  
**[0:15:18-0:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:15:18):**  configurating what sort of crops you want to grow.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:15:22):**  And then you need to look at like the technical details of like, well, what are optimal spacings  
**[0:15:26-0:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:15:26):**  and how many fit in a bed?  
**[0:15:28-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:15:28):**  And then you start getting into crop planning of like, well, what's a bed of this worth?  
**[0:15:33-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:15:33):**  And so a good way to start with that would be pegging your price to the marketplace.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:15:38):**  So what we do is we look at the wholesale suppliers and then we add a margin to it.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:15:45):**  So we're not competing on the same playing field.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:15:47):**  We've got locality as a marketing point, freshness.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:15:51):**  We're giving customers the product the day that we harvest it always and quality.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:15:58):**  We can do things by hand that machines and factories can't do, like those crappy salad  
**[0:16:04-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:16:04):**  bags you get in the supermarket.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:16:05):**  There's no competition.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:16:07):**  So there are three leverage points and they will always be your leverage points.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:16:11):**  And so then you have to seek out the sort of people who want those types of food.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:16:17):**  Chefs always want it, but they're a different ball game because they're very exacting and  
**[0:16:22-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:16:22):**  you know, they can like chefs all over the world can pick up the phone and order anything  
**[0:16:27-0:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:16:27):**  they want next day.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:16:28):**  And you are probably a pain in the ass.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:16:31):**  You are a marketing point for them, but you're a pain in the ass.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:16:33):**  So you have to learn how to present to them like they used to being presented to you need  
**[0:16:39-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:16:39):**  to speak their language as it were.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:16:42):**  But it also gives you then that opportunity on the flip side to sell bulk and sell excesses.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:16:47):**  And that's the way we've always marketed.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:16:49):**  We've basically lost all of our restaurant customers.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:16:53):**  So one of our most with COVID, which I'm sure many people have one of our most ideal customers  
**[0:16:59-0:17:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:16:59):**  is a big spa.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:17:01):**  That's quite famous in Sweden.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:17:02):**  It's the closest customer we could possibly have.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:17:05):**  And they would typically spend 40, 50,000 euros a year with us, not just on veg, but  
**[0:17:09-0:17:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:17:09):**  on chickens and eggs and stuff as well.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:17:12):**  But that's just disappeared.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:17:14):**  So we've leveraged all sales through the Rico rings that we can talk about if people aren't  
**[0:17:19-0:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:17:19):**  familiar with that, which is better for us because we get more by selling directly to  
**[0:17:26-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:17:26):**  customers anyway.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:17:32):**  And it's going off on a branch, but we started out as a CSA.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:17:41):**  And at the time we set up in Sweden, there were only five other CSAs in Sweden.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:17:45):**  So it was quite a new thing.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:17:46):**  Like I always say, Sweden is 20 years behind a lot of Europe.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:17:50):**  It's like we were the first people doing egg mobiles and pasted boilers.  
**[0:17:55-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:17:55):**  And it's all quite new here, whereas some of that in the countries you're listening  
**[0:17:59-0:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:17:59):**  from is probably many decades old.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:18:03):**  So we've transitioned ourselves quite a lot.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:18:05):**  So our planning has changed massively over the time we've been here.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:18:10):**  But it still focuses around the same core tenants, which is to optimize the ratio of  
**[0:18:18-0:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:18:18):**  highly valuable crops to low value crops.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:18:21):**  Don't try and compete with field grown crops like potatoes or cabbage.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:18:25):**  Like we'll even buy in crops from big organic farms and tell our customers we're doing that  
**[0:18:31-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:18:31):**  because it's more cost effective to do that.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:18:35):**  And yeah, and then just really what we've been doing in the last few years is leveraging  
**[0:18:43-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:18:43):**  our sales to as we've transitioned from veg box to Rico, which is a pre-sold farmers market.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:18:54):**  We've kind of incentivized people to stay on that veg box model.  
**[0:18:58-0:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:18:58):**  So we do a simple thing.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:18:59):**  We bunch vegetables at let's turn it into euro.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:19:02):**  So we bunch vegetables at two and a half euros of value.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:19:06):**  And we get to that value by looking at the wholesale price and adding a margin.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:19:12):**  And it's important to watch those prices, obviously, because, you know, some early tomatoes  
**[0:19:18-0:19:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:19:18):**  are worth a lot.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:19:19):**  But when everyone's got tomatoes, they're not worth anything.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:19:21):**  So you have to keep an eye on the wider food market.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:19:26):**  Like once you're producing and you're farming and selling in a globalized food market, essentially,  
**[0:19:32-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:19:32):**  you have to play by the rules to some degree.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:19:35):**  If you're a micro producer, you can kind of circumnavigate that.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:19:39):**  But for most of us with a bigger product portfolio, you have to be aware of, you know, what people  
**[0:19:46-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:19:46):**  can get with their money elsewhere.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:19:50):**  And what was I about to say?  
**[0:19:56-0:20:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:19:56):**  Yeah, so we bunch things at two and a half euros.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:20:01):**  But if you only so we're doing custom orders now.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:20:04):**  So if you only buy one bunch, you're a pain in the ass.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:20:08):**  You're not our ideal customer.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:20:10):**  So you can have that.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:20:11):**  But you're going to pay a premium.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:20:13):**  So we'll sell it to you for three and a half euros.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:20:16):**  And then we incentivize people.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:20:18):**  So if you buy five bunches, you pay 15 euros.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:20:21):**  If you buy 10, you pay 25 euros.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:20:23):**  I you get the actual value of the price we set.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:20:27):**  So we're being very open with customers about that.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:20:31):**  But we're telling them essentially by a veg box office and you get great crops at great  
**[0:20:37-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:20:37):**  value.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:20:38):**  If you buy less, you're a bit of a pain.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:20:41):**  So you can pay for it.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:20:42):**  And they're willing to do that.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:20:44):**  And it's been really interesting all of it to see as we transition fully over to Rico.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:20:51):**  We still had our CSA subscribers.  
**[0:20:54-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:20:54):**  And then on the adverts that come up on Facebook, it's like here's your veg box subscription.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:21:00):**  And here it is on Rico.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:21:01):**  And you can see it's the same thing, but it's 40% more expensive.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:21:05):**  And people really wanted to do that because.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:21:10):**  Let's face it, like in today's day and age, most people expect things next day delivery  
**[0:21:17-0:21:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:21:17):**  or whatever.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:21:18):**  You know, convenience is everything.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:21:21):**  And so people don't actually want to sign up for a whole season and pay up in front.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:21:27):**  You know, they like the idea of it and they feel good about it.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:21:30):**  But it's like it's so out of tune with how we consume across society that I feel like  
**[0:21:37-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:21:37):**  people are much happier not to have to do that.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:21:39):**  And there's a particular problem here in Sweden where everyone goes on long summer holidays  
**[0:21:45-0:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:21:45):**  here.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:21:46):**  So it's always a problem.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:21:47):**  And Swedish people don't talk to each other.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:21:49):**  So they don't, you know, like in England, you would just be like, hey, next door neighbor,  
**[0:21:54-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:21:54):**  you want my veg box for two weeks?  
**[0:21:55-0:21:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:21:55):**  I'm going away.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:21:56):**  But here that's, you know, we are not fully social distancing as a country.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:22:04):**  So that's a lot of people have problems with that.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:22:08):**  And people we found are willing to pay that 40 percent higher price to have the freedom  
**[0:22:12-0:22:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:22:12):**  of choice or the illusion of choice where we say, here's all the veg you can choose  
**[0:22:16-0:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:22:16):**  from.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:22:17):**  You can pick your own box, but we get to tell what's available anyway so we can manipulate  
**[0:22:22-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:22:22):**  and direct that to make sure we sell evenly across what we have to supply.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:22:28):**  So it but it's interesting.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:22:30):**  It's it's made me think like the next step for market gardeners is looking into convenience  
**[0:22:38-0:22:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:22:38):**  orientation.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:22:40):**  And that could look different ways that could look like ready packaged meals that people  
**[0:22:46-0:22:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:22:46):**  can cook in this increasingly busy society.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:22:48):**  I spoke to some people on the farm like a hero to last summer.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:22:53):**  There's the Irish farm that's branched out into that.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:22:58):**  And it's fantastic business for them.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:23:02):**  And whilst that's like, you know, if you're just setting up a market going on a couple  
**[0:23:06-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:23:06):**  of thousand square meters, the logistics and the sort of development and maturity of a  
**[0:23:11-0:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:23:11):**  business like that could seem miles away.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:23:14):**  But it's I think it's the next step to start considering.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:23:18):**  I feel like that whole piece around farmers being victims.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:23:23):**  It's almost like the way we choose to sell is playing into that.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:23:26):**  It's like, please come and help us out because we're struggling on the land.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:23:30):**  It's like, well, yeah, but no, that's not how the world works.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:23:34):**  It's like, how do we step up our games to one thing that I've seen a couple of people  
**[0:23:40-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:23:40):**  asking about is there's still some unclarity about what Rico rings are and how they're  
**[0:23:44-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:23:44):**  different from that CSA model or the veg boxes.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:23:47):**  If you could just clarify.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:23:49):**  Sure, they're totally different.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:23:51):**  So the CSA we ran is just like any CSA.  
**[0:23:54-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:23:54):**  I'm sure everyone is aware of that people are paying up front.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:23:57):**  They get a box each week for however many weeks we said.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:24:01):**  And we can tell them in advance approximately what they can expect.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:24:05):**  Rico is very different.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:24:06):**  So it came out of Finland, a man called Thomas Nelman.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:24:10):**  And Rico is spread wildly in Scandinavia.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:24:13):**  It's incredible.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:24:14):**  It's the most efficient sales model I've ever seen anywhere on the planet.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:24:19):**  It's basically run purely on Facebook.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:24:23):**  It's an organized farmer.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:24:26):**  It's a pre sold farmers market, you could say.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:24:30):**  And you have a Facebook group for the producers and you have a Facebook group for the outward  
**[0:24:38-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:24:38):**  facing bit and people in the town or wherever the location is can join up.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:24:44):**  And then every producer each week, say on Thursday is the day of the Rico.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:24:49):**  It's going to be Thursday in this car park at this time.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:24:52):**  So people put up their adverts on Friday for the week before and they say, I've got lamb.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:24:59):**  I sell it like this.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:25:00):**  It costs this much.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:25:01):**  Here's a video to how I produce it.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:25:03):**  I sell vegetables.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:25:04):**  I've got 10 varieties in the box.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:25:06):**  I've got eggs or whatever.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:25:09):**  And then you just write on Facebook, I'd like 30 eggs in the veg box.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:25:13):**  And that is a sales contract.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:25:16):**  And so that gets you around trading laws because you're not a marketplace.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:25:22):**  You're just delivering.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:25:24):**  So what we were doing from the beginning of the farm was cultivating these drop off points.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:25:29):**  And that was a really important thing we did kind of unknowingly in the first year, we  
**[0:25:34-0:25:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:25:34):**  spent a lot of time meeting people developing.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:25:38):**  It was my partner Hannah that mainly did this is just meeting people in the community and  
**[0:25:44-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:25:44):**  developing connections through having Fika with people.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:25:47):**  Fika is like coffee and biscuits in Sweden.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:25:50):**  But it's so important now in the rural, you know, it's what people do.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:25:54):**  And it's a very old culture that people have time for that.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:25:59):**  And through putting a lot of time into those networks, we developed into this sales model  
**[0:26:06-0:26:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:26:06):**  of just getting people on board to meet us halfway.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:26:10):**  So we would just turn up.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:26:11):**  We started in McDonald's car parks.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:26:13):**  We would turn up with like 4000 eggs and a load of frozen chicken.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:26:19):**  And yeah, it's funny, like finding places that are convenient for people leaving work  
**[0:26:24-0:26:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:26:24):**  at a time when people are leaving work.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:26:27):**  And then you've got this half hour window in winter and an hour in summer.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:26:31):**  And we just drop off all the products, get back to the farms to close hands up, etc.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:26:36):**  So we were trying to invite Swedish producers to come with us.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:26:39):**  We knew bakers, we knew cheese makers, artisanal meat people, etc.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:26:45):**  But it was too weird.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:26:47):**  They wouldn't get involved because it was just too far out of their normal sort of way  
**[0:26:51-0:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:26:51):**  of doing things.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:26:52):**  And then when this week of banner came along, it started spreading in Sweden massively.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:26:58):**  Just for context in Finland now, 5% of all food sales in Finland go through Rico, which  
**[0:27:03-0:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:27:03):**  is, you know, that's something.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:27:07):**  And this is just farmers turning up in a car park, opening the boot of their car and giving  
**[0:27:11-0:27:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:27:11):**  people food.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:27:12):**  It's pretty remarkable.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:27:13):**  And there's something like 600 odd in Scandinavia now.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:27:18):**  So what we did is we set up for locally to us.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:27:23):**  And because we were the admins, we decided the time and place.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:27:27):**  So we just used the time and place that we already used.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:27:31):**  And then all these other producers came along too.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:27:34):**  And that critical mass is key.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:27:36):**  So you need to have this like momentum to get people excited.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:27:40):**  You need a baker, meat producers, egg producers, veg producers, like enough food that people  
**[0:27:45-0:27:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:27:45):**  can turn up on their way home from work, buy a week's worth of awesome food and go.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:27:51):**  And so that critical mass is really key.  
**[0:27:54-0:27:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:27:54):**  And it drives the sort of healthy form of competition because everything's on Facebook,  
**[0:27:59-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:27:59):**  like you folks listening.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:28:01):**  If you have no idea what Rico is, you can go and join a Facebook Rico anywhere in Scandinavia.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:28:06):**  I think there was a video I made on YouTube where there's a map of all the Ricos in a  
**[0:28:11-0:28:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:28:11):**  link below.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:28:12):**  And you can click on that, find any Rico in Oslo or wherever, and go and join that Facebook  
**[0:28:18-0:28:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:28:18):**  group.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:28:19):**  And then you can see how it works.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:28:21):**  And so you make that post of what you produce, but everyone else does too.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:28:30):**  So you can see what all the competition is charging, how many they're selling.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:28:36):**  Oh, Mrs. Jones is doing better than us this week.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:28:40):**  Like, oh, she's marketing it differently.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:28:42):**  What's she doing?  
**[0:28:43-0:28:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:28:43):**  Oh, cool.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:28:44):**  That's a really nice way of taking photos or whatever.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:28:45):**  So it actually drives this really healthy competition where everything's visible across  
**[0:28:50-0:28:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:28:50):**  the board and it just makes everyone do better.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:28:53):**  And we influence that to some degree with nicer photos and washing the vehicle.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:28:59):**  And we turn up rather than turning up in scruffy farm gear and the dirty truck and opening  
**[0:29:05-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:29:05):**  the boot.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:29:06):**  And there's just dead cats and mud in there.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:29:08):**  It's like, no, we wash the vehicle.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:29:10):**  We clean ourselves.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:29:11):**  We show up nicely.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:29:12):**  We set up almost like a market stall and make an effort.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:29:16):**  And it attracts people because people are walking through this car park and we're very  
**[0:29:19-0:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:29:19):**  visible.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:29:21):**  And we usually have a big long line because we got so many different products.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:29:24):**  We have a big customer base.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:29:26):**  So what we found is it basically just for everyone else's customers to us.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:29:31):**  And it's been amazing to see like we've we didn't have hands this winter, so we haven't  
**[0:29:36-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:29:36):**  had eggs for sale for six months.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:29:38):**  We just reopened the subscriptions.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:29:40):**  We actually gave our customers to two other producers and we just opened this subscriptions  
**[0:29:46-0:29:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:29:46):**  a week ago and 95 percent of those customers are straight back.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:29:50):**  So it's it's a lot to do with like.  
**[0:29:55-0:29:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:29:55):**  Like an image and a reputation that's very powerful.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:29:59):**  You know how you present yourselves and the story you tell people are buying that.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:30:03):**  Why like why are you doing this?  
**[0:30:05-0:30:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:30:05):**  Why are you living out on some random hilltop in the wind and rain growing these ridiculous  
**[0:30:10-0:30:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:30:10):**  celery?  
**[0:30:11-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:30:11):**  Like, you know, there must be a reason you're choosing to do that as opposed to leading  
**[0:30:15-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:30:15):**  a normal life.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:30:16):**  So that storytelling is really important and powerful.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:30:20):**  And, you know, we live in a visual based world where an image says a thousand things and  
**[0:30:25-0:30:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:30:25):**  it's.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:30:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:30:29):**  And then so when the Rico actually happens, everyone shows up, drops off their products.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:30:36):**  It's an hour typically in summer, half an hour in winter.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:30:38):**  We can turn up drop 5000 euros of products in that hour.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:30:42):**  A little bit of customer contact, a little bit of eye contact.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:30:46):**  But the story I always tell is like that is enough for food security.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:30:51):**  Right.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:30:52):**  It's like, hey, look at you in the eye.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:30:54):**  Smile, acknowledge each other.  
**[0:30:55-0:30:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:30:55):**  See you later.  
**[0:30:56-0:31:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:30:56):**  It's like you don't have to listen to Mrs. Jones complaining about a cat.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:31:00):**  So I don't care about your cat.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:31:01):**  I need to get home and feed my chickens like, you know, like sitting there for half an hour  
**[0:31:06-0:31:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:31:06):**  chatting with people who just buy a tray of eggs.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:31:09):**  It's not worth your time.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:31:10):**  Like they're not paying for that time.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:31:12):**  So it's a very efficient way to sell a lot of products.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:31:17):**  And then at the end of the day, you clear that Facebook page and basically everyone  
**[0:31:21-0:31:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:31:21):**  kind of copies and pastes their ad again.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:31:25):**  So it clears itself out.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:31:26):**  New ads come up.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:31:27):**  Everyone signs up for next week and it keeps repeating like that.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:31:30):**  And just for reference, like in our.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:31:32):**  So we self-imposed a 50 kilometre sales radius around our farm when we moved here, not because  
**[0:31:40-0:31:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:31:40):**  we need to, but because my ideology was like, hey, I'll train you how to do what I'm doing,  
**[0:31:46-0:31:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:31:46):**  but you go and set up like 100 kilometres away.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:31:49):**  And if we keep spreading out, we'll produce food all over the country.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:31:53):**  And.  
**[0:31:55-0:32:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:31:55):**  In that, like we actually live remarkably rurally in Sweden and we probably have we  
**[0:32:04-0:32:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:32:04):**  have a town of 5000, a town of 10,000, a town of 20,000 in as our Rika rings.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:32:11):**  And then our biggest town is 50 kilometres away.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:32:14):**  Bear in mind in Sweden, people go 50 kilometres just to go to a restaurant.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:32:18):**  It's in the rural places like we are.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:32:21):**  But in that town of 50,000, 70,000.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:32:25):**  Sorry, that's 50 kilometres away.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:32:27):**  There are something like 16,000 people on that Rika ring.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:32:32):**  That means 16,000 random individuals in that town have gone and consciously clicked on  
**[0:32:37-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:32:37):**  that.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:32:38):**  It's like one in five people in that town is seeing our chickens every week.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:32:44):**  It's amazing.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:32:45):**  Like you couldn't get that even if you put thousands of euros into advertising.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:32:49):**  So it's a very powerful thing, but it really relies on a critical mass.  
**[0:32:54-0:33:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:32:54):**  Like some of our students have taken this to to Ireland and America, Canada, South Africa.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:33:01):**  Some of them seem to be working, some fizzled out.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:33:03):**  It's like you need to have a momentum because that's what draws people in.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:33:07):**  It's got to be enough products that it's happening for people.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:33:12):**  Otherwise, it's just a pain in the ass.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:33:14):**  They can just go to an organic store or just order it online and get a box next day.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:33:19):**  And yeah, but that's what Rico is.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:33:22):**  And I really recommend people looking into that.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:33:25):**  Like you might need to stick your neck out and pioneer it.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:33:28):**  But it's I've never seen anything like it in terms of efficiency.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:33:34):**  And you've got to think like who are the main purchases of good local organic food is typically  
**[0:33:40-0:33:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:33:40):**  generally speaking, it's young mothers of young children.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:33:45):**  They are the biggest consumers of organic food or old elderly people who remember that  
**[0:33:53-0:33:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:33:53):**  food used to actually taste like something.  
**[0:33:57-0:33:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:33:57):**  And so you can really target that.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:33:59):**  You know, it's there's a lot to be said for the digital modalities we have now where you  
**[0:34:05-0:34:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:34:05):**  can really target people.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:34:06):**  And I've had I know people have very different levels of success with advertising and things,  
**[0:34:12-0:34:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:34:12):**  but I've found it incredible.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:34:15):**  I reckon for every dollar I put into Facebook ads, I've got fifteen dollars out, which is  
**[0:34:21-0:34:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:34:21):**  an incredible return.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:34:23):**  So it's you know, we have tools at our fingertips now that mean it's easier than ever, albeit  
**[0:34:30-0:34:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:34:30):**  a bit more overwhelming than ever.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:34:32):**  But Rico is a big one.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:34:35):**  And yeah, I highly recommend.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:34:37):**  Yeah, so we went in deep about the Rico rings because that has been something that you've  
**[0:34:43-0:34:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:34:43):**  helped to pioneer and really gotten established as one of your main marketing bases.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:34:47):**  But it's actually it's our own marketing basis now.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:34:51):**  Like we sell 100 percent of everything through.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:34:54):**  We can now.  
**[0:34:55-0:34:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:34:55):**  Now, there are definitely people here who don't have access to a Rico ring yet or it's  
**[0:34:59-0:35:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:34:59):**  not established where they live.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:35:01):**  I like how you mentioned that there are people who have made different efforts to set up  
**[0:35:05-0:35:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:35:05):**  similar types of marketing models in different places to various levels of success.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:35:10):**  Here in Spain, I've seen a couple come up.  
**[0:35:12-0:35:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:35:12):**  Some of them actually sponsored by the local provincial governments and others that seem  
**[0:35:16-0:35:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:35:16):**  to be kind of broader and based online.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:35:19):**  But if that's not a really viable marketing option for where you live, what are some of  
**[0:35:26-0:35:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:35:26):**  the others that you found success with before really relying on this to get to your customers?  
**[0:35:32-0:35:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:35:32):**  Well, CSA can work, I mean, that varies across the region to region, but like CSA is very  
**[0:35:39-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:35:39):**  helpful when people are starting out because it gives you the ability to get cash in and  
**[0:35:45-0:35:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:35:45):**  establish cash flow.  
**[0:35:47-0:35:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:35:47):**  But my sort of reflection on that is like you really need to know what you know and  
**[0:35:53-0:35:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:35:53):**  you need to know what you don't know.  
**[0:35:56-0:36:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:35:56):**  Like think about cultivating your ideal customer, like the sort of person who's willing to pay  
**[0:36:01-0:36:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:36:01):**  you up front for something you say that you might be able to produce.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:36:05):**  That's the exact type of customer you want.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:36:08):**  And there's this whole Pareto principle 80-20 thing, right, of like that came out of the  
**[0:36:15-0:36:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:36:15):**  sort of business world.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:36:17):**  But you're not just farming vegetables or whatever it is, you're farming customers too.  
**[0:36:24-0:36:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:36:24):**  Like you want that type of customer and you don't want pain in the ass customers that  
**[0:36:29-0:36:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:36:29):**  need to tell you about their cat and stuff like that.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:36:32):**  So you kind of want to start at a scale where you have more customers or a bigger supply  
**[0:36:40-0:36:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:36:40):**  of customers than you need so that you can actually cull some of your customers.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:36:45):**  People always get offended when I talk about cull this, but this is how we think of plants  
**[0:36:48-0:36:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:36:48):**  and animals.  
**[0:36:50-0:36:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:36:50):**  And you need to be ruthless with your customer base like that.  
**[0:36:53-0:37:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:36:53):**  It's like it's a privilege to be able to buy incredible food in a world where good food  
**[0:37:00-0:37:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:37:00):**  is quite sparse.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:37:02):**  So as a busy farmer, you need people to meet you halfway.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:37:06):**  And if they're like we have like a strike thing.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:37:09):**  It's like if you're late, we'll phone you and say, hey, can I leave your order on the  
**[0:37:15-0:37:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:37:15):**  doorstep of this shop that the Rico's outside?  
**[0:37:18-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:37:18):**  Sure.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:37:19):**  No problem.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:37:20):**  OK.  
**[0:37:21-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:37:21):**  And if they're late again, it's like, look, basically, you're not going to be a customer  
**[0:37:25-0:37:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:37:25):**  anymore because you can't afford to wait for someone for 10 minutes.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:37:29):**  Like that the time the time it's taking is not worth it.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:37:34):**  So I think.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:37:36):**  You need to early on be ruthless with cultivating the types of customers you actually want.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:37:41):**  And then if you get those types of customers, you bloody well better be sure that you give  
**[0:37:47-0:37:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:37:47):**  them what they pay for.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:37:48):**  You know, so if they've paid 20 euros for a veg box, make sure there's 22 euros, 24  
**[0:37:54-0:37:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:37:54):**  euros of stuff in it.  
**[0:37:56-0:38:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:37:56):**  You know, give them that extra bonus of herbs or excesses of crops you've got or a bunch  
**[0:38:04-0:38:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:38:04):**  of flowers or whatever.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:38:05):**  It's like, you know, if you're scrimping just to make what they actually paid for, they  
**[0:38:10-0:38:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:38:10):**  ain't coming back the next year.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:38:11):**  It's like so that's my advice is like over offer.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:38:15):**  So the thing I say over extend yourself in what you actually supply like CSA is really  
**[0:38:23-0:38:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:38:23):**  great, but you must be sure that you can produce what you say and it's advisable to extend  
**[0:38:31-0:38:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:38:31):**  yourself beyond that because like a typical figure certainly that comes out of the States  
**[0:38:36-0:38:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:38:36):**  is like a 75% retention rate is considered very good in the market gardening CSA.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:38:43):**  And yeah, another part of that would be seeking honest feedback.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:38:50):**  So how do you get feedback?  
**[0:38:52-0:39:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:38:52):**  Like, you know, if I asked you to write a page on a four page of how this call was tonight,  
**[0:39:00-0:39:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:39:00):**  you know, I would anticipate 75% of it would either not be answered or would be absolutely  
**[0:39:07-0:39:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:39:07):**  useless feedback.  
**[0:39:09-0:39:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:39:09):**  No offense, but this is how feedback works.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:39:12):**  And it's like the useful feedback is not generated in that way.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:39:17):**  So how do you get really good feedback?  
**[0:39:21-0:39:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:39:21):**  One way we do that is invite people to the farm and we just host them and feed them and  
**[0:39:28-0:39:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:39:28):**  get local brewery coming in with this local beer and tell stories.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:39:33):**  And now we're like family and now we can talk and look at each other in the eye.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:39:36):**  And that's where feedback happens.  
**[0:39:38-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:39:38):**  You know, a feedback form who wants to fill in a feedback form?  
**[0:39:41-0:39:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:39:41):**  You know, usually the only sort of people that want to fill a feedback form in are the  
**[0:39:47-0:39:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:39:47):**  people that are stimulated and have problems to shout at you.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:39:51):**  So it's not very constructive.  
**[0:39:53-0:40:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:39:53):**  So yeah, I would say be very yeah, be very careful to communicate and to foster mutually  
**[0:40:05-0:40:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:40:05):**  beneficial communications with those ideal customers because you can't afford to lose  
**[0:40:09-0:40:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:40:09):**  them.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:40:12):**  And it's a very special thing.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:40:13):**  Like that's why we got such high returns on our egg subscriptions now.  
**[0:40:17-0:40:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:40:17):**  It's like those customers will always be loyal to us as long as we don't piss them off, basically.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:40:24):**  And they will even accept six months without producing eggs.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:40:28):**  That's half the year.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:40:29):**  But they're fine with that because they understand that we're pretty tired.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:40:32):**  We need a rest because we've been going at it for the last seven years.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:40:36):**  So that's cool.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:40:38):**  That's resiliency.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:40:39):**  It feels like, you know, and that comes from that little bit of real interaction.  
**[0:40:47-0:40:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:40:47):**  You have to be sitting down with the people for half an hour at a time.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:40:51):**  It's just like we're in a living relationship, you know, and that's what a genuine customer  
**[0:40:56-0:40:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:40:56):**  is, I think.  
**[0:40:57-0:41:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:40:57):**  I think that's the difference between investing in a community as a whole and really seeing  
**[0:41:02-0:41:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:41:02):**  your role in it as larger than just doing business.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:41:06):**  And certainly the relationships you cultivate as larger than just being customer and producer  
**[0:41:11-0:41:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:41:11):**  and going that extra mile to understand not only their wants from what they expect from  
**[0:41:16-0:41:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:41:16):**  you, but also opening up that dialogue like you've talked about, which you can't do just  
**[0:41:22-0:41:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:41:22):**  from kind of cold solicitation to come to you and have a personal relationship.  
**[0:41:28-0:41:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:41:28):**  Totally.  
**[0:41:29-0:41:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:41:29):**  And it's like a part of that farmer mentality thing is like often people feel that they're  
**[0:41:34-0:41:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:41:34):**  on the outside of this community looking in.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:41:36):**  But it's like you've got to get your head around.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:41:39):**  You are the center of your community.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:41:41):**  It revolves around you.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:41:43):**  It's like you're making food, three meals a day, every day.  
**[0:41:47-0:41:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:41:47):**  You know, that's what it's like that old cliche of agricultural supported communities.  
**[0:41:54-0:41:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:41:54):**  That's really that's the sort of mindset we need to inhabit, I think.  
**[0:41:58-0:42:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:41:58):**  Well, you've done a really good job about talking about a lot of the things that I'd  
**[0:42:01-0:42:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:42:01):**  already had planned to ask for you, which is why I like doing these chats, because I  
**[0:42:04-0:42:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:42:04):**  really don't like doing work.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:42:06):**  But one of the things that you often really stress when speaking to people who have limitations,  
**[0:42:13-0:42:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:42:13):**  whether it's in their market size or in what they're capable of producing or in their land  
**[0:42:17-0:42:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:42:17):**  base, we're trying to expand their operations, thinking that they need to grow bigger and  
**[0:42:21-0:42:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:42:21):**  begin to produce more.  
**[0:42:22-0:42:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:42:22):**  I know you are.  
**[0:42:23-0:42:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:42:23):**  You already know where I'm headed with this.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:42:25):**  Talk about.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:42:27):**  Can you talk about how creating efficiency and intensity is usually the way to go and  
**[0:42:34-0:42:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:42:34):**  in deceptive when people are always trying to go bigger?  
**[0:42:37-0:42:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:42:37):**  Yeah, definitely.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:42:39):**  That's a really important one.  
**[0:42:41-0:42:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:42:41):**  Planning for growth.  
**[0:42:42-0:42:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:42:42):**  So as I get older, there's a few things that come like so my career was a lot in land design  
**[0:42:50-0:42:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:42:50):**  and doing a lot of consulting when I was younger and on all different scales up to industrial  
**[0:42:58-0:43:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:42:58):**  scale act like the, you know, working on projects, dealing with hundreds of thousands of hectares  
**[0:43:03-0:43:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:43:03):**  in Mexico and stuff.  
**[0:43:04-0:43:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:43:04):**  And it I'm more and more focused on small scale ag now because I believe in it.  
**[0:43:13-0:43:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:43:13):**  And I believe in the wonderful, weird people that are moving into that space who aren't  
**[0:43:18-0:43:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:43:18):**  the sons and daughters of farmers typically.  
**[0:43:21-0:43:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:43:21):**  And there are some benefits and there are some steep learning curves.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:43:25):**  You know, it's the most potential I see is in flexible minded entrepreneurial folks who  
**[0:43:32-0:43:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:43:32):**  haven't been regimented by institutions or parents who are farmers.  
**[0:43:39-0:43:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:43:39):**  However, running a business is a massive thing for anyone.  
**[0:43:43-0:43:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:43:43):**  And running a farming business is about as vertical as a, you know, steep, get a bit  
**[0:43:51-0:44:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:43:51):**  older and less sharp and less strong is like, well, how little can you do?  
**[0:44:00-0:44:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:44:00):**  That's a good question to ask yourself, especially for me in my context where I've got people  
**[0:44:05-0:44:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:44:05):**  coming here that want to try and copy what our farm is doing.  
**[0:44:09-0:44:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:44:09):**  And it's nearly always now you definitely don't want to do that.  
**[0:44:13-0:44:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:44:13):**  Our farm is very specifically set up to saturate people with possibilities in a world where  
**[0:44:20-0:44:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:44:20):**  our agricultural institutions are, you know, not turning out useful farmers.  
**[0:44:28-0:44:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:44:28):**  And yeah, and it's run by maniac.  
**[0:44:32-0:44:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:44:32):**  So but the so how little can you do?  
**[0:44:40-0:44:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:44:40):**  And how small can you go?  
**[0:44:42-0:44:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:44:42):**  Oh, that's a good one.  
**[0:44:44-0:44:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:44:44):**  How small can you go?  
**[0:44:46-0:44:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:44:46):**  So there's a great example of this.  
**[0:44:51-0:44:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:44:51):**  I don't know who's listening in.  
**[0:44:52-0:44:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:44:52):**  But my dear friend Marco, I'll tell this story.  
**[0:44:55-0:44:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:44:55):**  So Marco at Terra in Luxembourg.  
**[0:44:59-0:45:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:44:59):**  There's a video on our YouTube channel.  
**[0:45:02-0:45:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:45:02):**  And you can see a bit of the process when I was visiting them some years ago.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:45:09):**  The video is called something like a beautiful farm under the orchards.  
**[0:45:13-0:45:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:45:13):**  It's like trees with market garden underneath.  
**[0:45:16-0:45:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:45:16):**  And then I interviewed Marco for the farm like a hero thing last year and asked him  
**[0:45:20-0:45:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:45:20):**  about what happened.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:45:21):**  So so they were in a very typical situation.  
**[0:45:25-0:45:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:45:25):**  They set up an amazing business.  
**[0:45:26-0:45:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:45:26):**  Terra is like a cooperative where they're all on 30,000 euros salary as for them running  
**[0:45:32-0:45:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:45:32):**  250 bedshares on a couple of hectares.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:45:38):**  And first kind of CSA in Luxembourg, right outside Luxembourg cities boundary.  
**[0:45:44-0:45:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:45:44):**  And they were all in different life like changing life circumstances where one had just split  
**[0:45:50-0:45:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:45:50):**  up and needed to rent a new house.  
**[0:45:51-0:45:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:45:51):**  So they needed more money.  
**[0:45:53-0:45:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:45:53):**  Everyone had a kid, so they needed more money.  
**[0:45:56-0:45:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:45:56):**  Everyone needed more money.  
**[0:45:57-0:46:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:45:57):**  So they were in this absolutely stereotypical place of.  
**[0:46:05-0:46:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:46:05):**  And the answer is always no.  
**[0:46:08-0:46:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:46:08):**  Don't do that.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:46:10):**  So I actually in that video is really cool because I, Mark is a dear friend of mine.  
**[0:46:16-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:46:16):**  I've known him a decade and I lived with him for a few years and I love him dearly.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:46:21):**  And so I could say things to him that you can't just say to someone easily.  
**[0:46:28-0:46:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:46:28):**  And and I'm aware of this very much in my role with education and any degree of public  
**[0:46:37-0:46:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:46:37):**  figure that I am.  
**[0:46:38-0:46:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:46:38):**  I'm very careful with my speech and I'm very aware that what I say is often taken very  
**[0:46:46-0:46:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:46:46):**  directly for people.  
**[0:46:50-0:46:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:46:50):**  You know, people are shaping their decision making with it.  
**[0:46:52-0:46:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:46:52):**  So I'm careful about something.  
**[0:46:59-0:47:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:46:59):**  And I know it's not through consulting career.  
**[0:47:00-0:47:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:47:00):**  It's like people are paying me and projecting stuff onto me that I can actually ask questions  
**[0:47:07-0:47:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:47:07):**  and say uncomfortable things that no one else around them can because it's like a doctor.  
**[0:47:12-0:47:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:47:12):**  We project onto this person like, you know, a teacher or whatever.  
**[0:47:18-0:47:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:47:18):**  And so I'm acutely aware of the psychology of that, too.  
**[0:47:22-0:47:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:47:22):**  Now in that context, there's a bit of that video on YouTube where I sit them down at  
**[0:47:28-0:47:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:47:28):**  lunchtime and I tell them, like, all right, here's what I would do.  
**[0:47:33-0:47:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:47:33):**  And basically they were farming one meter, 20 beds using inefficient tools.  
**[0:47:40-0:47:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:47:40):**  They were seeding their seeding chart was really sparse.  
**[0:47:45-0:47:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:47:45):**  Like I grow things up to six times more densely.  
**[0:47:50-0:47:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:47:50):**  And what else was that?  
**[0:47:53-0:47:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:47:53):**  Yeah, they were they were not selling everything they produce.  
**[0:47:56-0:47:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:47:56):**  So they were doing all these lovely CSA shares.  
**[0:47:59-0:48:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:47:59):**  And then the day that I was there filming, they harvested nearly a thousand euros of  
**[0:48:03-0:48:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:48:03):**  tomatoes and just chuck them in the veg boxes that were already worth more than they were  
**[0:48:07-0:48:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:48:07):**  selling them for.  
**[0:48:08-0:48:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:48:08):**  And so that's nuts.  
**[0:48:10-0:48:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:48:10):**  Like you're right outside the capital city and you've got like tomato crops like this  
**[0:48:15-0:48:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:48:15):**  that you're just giving to your customers for free.  
**[0:48:18-0:48:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:48:18):**  So I advise them to like I know how much work they put into making these beds, but I advise  
**[0:48:25-0:48:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:48:25):**  them to go down to 75 centimeter beds so they could utilize better tools.  
**[0:48:31-0:48:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:48:31):**  And they're using drip irrigation.  
**[0:48:32-0:48:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:48:32):**  So I knew it was a big ask, you know.  
**[0:48:37-0:48:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:48:37):**  Oh, yes.  
**[0:48:38-0:48:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:48:38):**  The other main thing they were doing is they had beds of 10 meters, 20 meters, 30 meters.  
**[0:48:42-0:48:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:48:42):**  They say it doesn't matter how long your beds are, but make them all the same because otherwise  
**[0:48:47-0:48:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:48:47):**  you're you know, they had separate folders for crop planning for all these different  
**[0:48:51-0:48:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:48:51):**  bloody beds.  
**[0:48:52-0:48:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:48:52):**  It's like that's nuts.  
**[0:48:54-0:48:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:48:54):**  Like even if you don't change your bed, say that your 30 meter bed is actually 310 meter  
**[0:48:59-0:49:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:48:59):**  beds and then your planning is the same, right?  
**[0:49:01-0:49:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:49:01):**  It's easy.  
**[0:49:02-0:49:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:49:02):**  So I told them to sort that out.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:49:05):**  Look at their seed densities.  
**[0:49:08-0:49:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:49:08):**  And then I was like, if you can go to 75 centimeter beds, I was not expecting them to do that.  
**[0:49:14-0:49:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:49:14):**  But it was like, that's what I would do.  
**[0:49:16-0:49:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:49:16):**  But that's a big ask.  
**[0:49:19-0:49:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:49:19):**  Anyway, speaking to Marco last summer, they actually did everything that I suggested.  
**[0:49:26-0:49:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:49:26):**  And they all got the pay rise they needed and enough surplus to employ a whole nother  
**[0:49:33-0:49:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:49:33):**  person whilst not increasing any of their work.  
**[0:49:38-0:49:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:49:38):**  Like no extra beds and less work for everyone.  
**[0:49:42-0:49:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:49:42):**  And it's perfect.  
**[0:49:43-0:49:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:49:43):**  And that's how it happens every time.  
**[0:49:44-0:49:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:49:44):**  And I really recommend going and looking that in, you know, just soaking it in because nearly  
**[0:49:51-0:49:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:49:51):**  every time I see someone saying I need more money, I'm going to expand, they will fail.  
**[0:49:57-0:49:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:49:57):**  And so my advice is like doubling down.  
**[0:49:59-0:50:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:49:59):**  It's like, OK, you need 20,000 euros more.  
**[0:50:02-0:50:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:50:02):**  How could you do that with 20 percent less of your market garden as it is currently?  
**[0:50:07-0:50:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:50:07):**  That would be the right way to approach it.  
**[0:50:09-0:50:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:50:09):**  Like how small can you go?  
**[0:50:12-0:50:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:50:12):**  And yeah.  
**[0:50:13-0:50:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:50:13):**  Well, there's a lot of observation and auditing what it is that you're not doing very efficiently  
**[0:50:21-0:50:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:50:21):**  or where there are holes in your production or your sales model or opportunities that  
**[0:50:25-0:50:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:50:25):**  are not being met in the current way you're managing things.  
**[0:50:28-0:50:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:50:28):**  Right.  
**[0:50:29-0:50:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:50:29):**  But that's what you're doing.  
**[0:50:30-0:50:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:50:30):**  It's like that's the same as running any business.  
**[0:50:34-0:50:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins-helps-troubleshoot-your-market-garden/#t=0:50:34):**  There you have it, thanks especially to Richard Perkins for sharing his knowledge and experience.

**[0:02:03-0:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:02:03):**  My guest today has been a big inspiration to me and has been a leader in regenerative  
**[0:02:07-0:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:02:07):**  design pretty much before that was even a term.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:02:10):**  Bill Reed is an internationally recognized practitioner, lecturer, and authority in sustainability  
**[0:02:16-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:02:16):**  and regenerative planning, design, and implementation.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:02:19):**  He is the principal in both Integrative Design Incorporated and Regenesis, two organizations  
**[0:02:24-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:02:24):**  working to lift green building and community planning into full integration and evolution  
**[0:02:29-0:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:02:29):**  with living systems.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:02:31):**  Bill is also the author of many technical articles and contributed to many books including  
**[0:02:36-0:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:02:36):**  the seminal work Integrative Design Guide to Green Building.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:02:40):**  He is also a founding director of the U.S. Green Building Council and one of the co-founders  
**[0:02:44-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:02:44):**  of the LEED Green Building Rating System.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:02:47):**  Bill has consulted on over 200 green design commissions, the majority of which are LEED  
**[0:02:52-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:02:52):**  Gold and Platinum and Living Building Challenge projects.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:02:55):**  He is also a keynote speaker at major building and design events, as well as a guest lecturer  
**[0:03:00-0:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:03:00):**  to universities throughout Europe and North America, including Harvard, MIT, Princeton,  
**[0:03:05-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:03:05):**  and the University of Pennsylvania.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:03:07):**  I've been looking forward to connecting with Bill for quite some time and this interview  
**[0:03:11-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:03:11):**  did not disappoint.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:03:12):**  We talk at length about Bill's design process and the perspective needed to remain open  
**[0:03:17-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:03:17):**  to the full scope and context that a design might affect.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:03:21):**  Bill warns of the dangers of going into a design job looking for problems to solve and  
**[0:03:25-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:03:25):**  projects to implement before understanding and listening to the place and the people  
**[0:03:29-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:03:29):**  in it.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:03:30):**  The insights from this interview were quite profound for me and I hope this will spark  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:03:34):**  a larger conversation about what regenerative design is and has the power to do, but before  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:03:39):**  getting too long winded on this intro, I'll turn things over now to Bill.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:03:44):**  Hey Bill, thank you so much for taking the time to be with us today.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:03:47):**  It's a pleasure to have you here.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:03:49):**  Thanks Oliver.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:03:50):**  Delighted to be here.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:03:51):**  Nice to meet you.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:03:52):**  Well, look, I've already researched and followed your work for quite some time, but for the  
**[0:03:56-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:03:56):**  sake of our audience, would you mind giving us a little bit of your background?  
**[0:03:59-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:03:59):**  Tell us about when your passion for the environment really started to ignite and how that is translated  
**[0:04:06-0:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:04:06):**  into your design philosophy.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:04:08):**  Oh, that's a long story, but I'll try to make it reasonably quick.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:04:14):**  I was turned on to Lewis Mumford when I was in eighth or ninth grade in high school and  
**[0:04:21-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:04:21):**  I became a regional planning geek and my whole idea was to be an architect and then an urban  
**[0:04:30-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:04:30):**  and regional planner.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:04:33):**  I could see when I was in college that I couldn't make sense of it, but planning made no sense  
**[0:04:38-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:04:38):**  to me because it all seemed to be dealing with zoning and economic issues and political  
**[0:04:44-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:04:44):**  issues.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:04:45):**  It wasn't until a few years later in the late 80s that I realized that what had been missing  
**[0:04:53-0:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:04:53):**  and no one was able to explain it to me when I was in school that sustainability as a concept,  
**[0:04:58-0:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:04:58):**  meaning the environment, how we take care of ourselves, was the ultimate purpose in  
**[0:05:03-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:05:03):**  creating quality of life.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:05:06):**  Once I figured that out, then it was off to the races and trying to figure out how to  
**[0:05:10-0:05:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:05:10):**  apply that from the world of architecture.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:05:12):**  So I ended up graduating with an architectural degree.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:05:16):**  So my first effort was in passive solar design way before the passive house movement came  
**[0:05:21-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:05:21):**  out, but this was in the mid to late 70s.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:05:27):**  That was more from an energy efficiency perspective.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:05:30):**  We moved into the sustainability movement as a concept in the 80s and that's when the  
**[0:05:38-0:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:05:38):**  US Green Building Council in the late 1994 was formed.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:05:43):**  One of the questions that we asked at the time is, well, we're going to talk about green  
**[0:05:47-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:05:47):**  buildings, which made a lot of sense.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:05:48):**  How do we integrate not just energy efficiency but integrate all the other environmental  
**[0:05:53-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:05:53):**  issues that come with architecture and building?  
**[0:05:57-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:05:57):**  How do we make a reasonably whole system of metrics?  
**[0:06:03-0:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:06:03):**  And the LEED system was developed.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:06:05):**  There were six of us that founded that in 1994.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:06:11):**  Even though LEED was not necessarily a living whole, as we would call it now from a regenerative  
**[0:06:16-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:06:16):**  perspective, it was a market transformation mechanism to shift the market from business  
**[0:06:23-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:06:23):**  as usual to at least asking questions about green.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:06:27):**  And to that extent, LEED has been very successful.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:06:30):**  I would say LEED is a total failure about defining sustainability because it doesn't  
**[0:06:38-0:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:06:38):**  define sustainability.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:06:39):**  It defines levels of greenness that aspire towards a sustainable condition, I think is  
**[0:06:46-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:06:46):**  what we could actually say about LEED.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:06:48):**  I would also say the same thing about Living Building Challenge.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:06:50):**  It really doesn't define sustainability but asks much deeper questions and LEED does to  
**[0:06:56-0:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:06:56):**  get us to think more rigorously about it.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:06:59):**  Neither of them though are talking about what I came to discover is how does we actually  
**[0:07:04-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:07:04):**  one develop a regenerative relationship with these living systems that we live within.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:07:10):**  And so that journey happened through asking the question about integrated designs.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:07:17):**  Let me go back to LEED.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:07:18):**  We knew that LEED was just a bunch of credits we threw on the wall.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:07:23):**  What would make it effective is to integrate them.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:07:25):**  So how do we work in a siloed profession, the building profession is not even a, we  
**[0:07:30-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:07:30):**  call it the building industry, it's not an industry.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:07:32):**  There's no CEO of the building industry.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:07:34):**  We have multiple, even up to 100 different specialties in the building industry.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:07:39):**  How do we get out of that siloed world and work as a united front?  
**[0:07:43-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:07:43):**  So that's why we developed, one of the developers of an integrated design process.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:07:49):**  And as we were doing that, we asked the fundamental question, where do we stop integrating?  
**[0:07:54-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:07:54):**  At the building wall envelope, at the site, at the community, at the watershed, the planet,  
**[0:08:00-0:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:08:00):**  the universe?  
**[0:08:01-0:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:08:01):**  So this is when it starts getting into the metaphysical realm and began to beg the question,  
**[0:08:08-0:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:08:08):**  how do we work with these massive, large and seemingly complex systems in an effective  
**[0:08:14-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:08:14):**  way?  
**[0:08:15-0:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:08:15):**  And that's what leads us up to this discussion today, Oliver, is how do we actually work  
**[0:08:20-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:08:20):**  so that we are regenerating life and working with the systems of life, not just reducing  
**[0:08:26-0:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:08:26):**  the damage by making technologies more efficient?  
**[0:08:30-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:08:30):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:08:31):**  Okay.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:08:32):**  I think I said that with one breath.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:08:33):**  Yeah, well done.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:08:35):**  Very concise.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:08:36):**  Along those lines, especially as we're talking about these different certifications, especially  
**[0:08:41-0:08:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:08:41):**  with LEED that you helped to define and the living building challenge as well, they seem  
**[0:08:46-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:08:46):**  to serve as good metrics to make sure that you're kind of painting within the lines and  
**[0:08:51-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:08:51):**  not going too far out.  
**[0:08:53-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:08:53):**  But like you said, they don't necessarily incentivize people to aspire to greater connection  
**[0:09:00-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:09:00):**  or better integration within the holes, within the communities and ecology in which they're  
**[0:09:05-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:09:05):**  designing for.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:09:08):**  And that's something that I've become really interested in is the idea of can you legislate  
**[0:09:12-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:09:12):**  in an aspirational way, not simply punishing going below the standards, but find rewards  
**[0:09:20-0:09:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:09:20):**  and incentives to get people to bypass or completely surpass standards as they currently  
**[0:09:27-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:09:27):**  are.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:09:28):**  Was that kind of the idea behind putting in those certification bodies?  
**[0:09:32-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:09:32):**  Well, the certification bodies, we actually hoped that they would not be made law.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:09:38):**  That's actually one of the worst – in my mind, that's one of the worst things that  
**[0:09:41-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:09:41):**  can happen because it's very difficult to change laws.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:09:44):**  It's much easier to change systems within a private organization.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:09:48):**  But once it gets into the bureaucracy, you're almost locked into these kind of low-grade  
**[0:09:53-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:09:53):**  goals because the goals take years to change.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:09:56):**  So we don't consider that a healthy system.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:10:00):**  Basically, how do we participate in evolution?  
**[0:10:03-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:10:03):**  How do we actually engage with what is truly important for the health and quality of life  
**[0:10:09-0:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:10:09):**  in the place we live, not only for humans but for all living things?  
**[0:10:14-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:10:14):**  That's the question.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:10:15):**  And so metrics and design intentions need to address what does it take for life to live  
**[0:10:24-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:10:24):**  and evolve – that's really an important qualification – and evolve in this particular  
**[0:10:29-0:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:10:29):**  place.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:10:30):**  So until we create a zoning or laws that actually require anybody who builds to answer that  
**[0:10:38-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:10:38):**  question, we will not be successful at a regenerative process.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:10:44):**  So how that's going to happen, that's quite complex.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:10:48):**  But we've got a long way to go before that.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:10:49):**  And the first step is that we have to demonstrate that integrating this regenerative thinking  
**[0:10:55-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:10:55):**  into projects is actually cost-effective and it's what people really want when they slow  
**[0:11:02-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:11:02):**  down and ask themselves what's important.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:11:07):**  So I can go off on a tangent right now in terms of when people are introduced to this  
**[0:11:12-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:11:12):**  – let me just frame it.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:11:13):**  People are introduced to the idea of improving a place's quality of life and not just slowing  
**[0:11:20-0:11:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:11:20):**  down the damage as most laws and most activists are interested in.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:11:26):**  It's revelatory to people and it really motivates people to engage their place in a new way.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:11:32):**  I'm going to pause for a breath there, Oliver.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:11:35):**  By all means.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:11:37):**  Well, so I guess…  
**[0:11:39-0:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:11:39):**  Did that make sense?  
**[0:11:40-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:11:40):**  Wait a minute, I just want to check.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:11:41):**  Did that make sense, what I just said?  
**[0:11:43-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:11:43):**  It made sense to me.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:11:44):**  I just hope I was understanding it correctly.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:11:46):**  I guess what it's caused me to think about is where do you start the analysis process  
**[0:11:51-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:11:51):**  in answering those questions?  
**[0:11:52-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:11:52):**  Because we talked a little bit earlier just before starting this recording about how the  
**[0:11:58-0:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:11:58):**  questions that you ask are essential to the answers you're going to get to.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:12:02):**  So what are some of those questions that you begin by asking that set the framework and  
**[0:12:07-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:12:07):**  the intention for the rest of the project?  
**[0:12:11-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:12:11):**  Okay, the first thing we ask and we assume is that if we start with the project, we've  
**[0:12:17-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:12:17):**  started in the wrong place.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:12:19):**  That we need to start with the largest manageable socio-ecological system.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:12:25):**  Now manageable is a big… that's a wide open word.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:12:29):**  That's the caveat.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:12:30):**  But yeah, but yet anything… we manage cities all the time.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:12:35):**  How well, that's another question.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:12:36):**  But so the first question we ask and we interview people and we tromp around.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:12:43):**  We spend a week or two basically learning the ecology of the place and the watershed  
**[0:12:48-0:12:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:12:48):**  and where water flows and habitat typologies and social typologies.  
**[0:12:55-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:12:55):**  But the first thing we ask is how big is here?  
**[0:12:57-0:13:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:12:57):**  That's a question that Helen Newton-Harris and the ecological artist out of San Francisco  
**[0:13:03-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:13:03):**  taught us to ask, how big is here, and that is an evocative question.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:13:07):**  What's really cool is everybody knows how big here is.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:13:12):**  And it could be 10 mile, 20 mile diameter area.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:13:16):**  It could depend on places upriver and downriver that feel connected.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:13:21):**  We just ask questions like, is that town part of the domain that we're considering?  
**[0:13:25-0:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:13:25):**  Oh, no, no, no.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:13:26):**  We don't talk to them at all.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:13:28):**  Our high school doesn't even play them in sports, that kind of thing.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:13:36):**  What do they consider part of their town, whether it's political boundaries or not?  
**[0:13:41-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:13:41):**  Now we know we have something to work on.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:13:42):**  So now what's the potential of this area that we call here to be brought to be in a  
**[0:13:52-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:13:52):**  situation of health?  
**[0:13:53-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:13:53):**  What's the potential?  
**[0:13:55-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:13:55):**  So we never start with goals, because goals are actually limiting.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:13:59):**  We never start with problems.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:14:01):**  We don't ask people what the problems are, because problems fragment thinking.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:14:05):**  You never understand.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:14:06):**  So basically if I raised my child by continually harping on his problems, we probably wouldn't  
**[0:14:14-0:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:14:14):**  get very far.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:14:15):**  What we want to work on is his potential.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:14:20):**  What's the essence that drives him or her towards a career?  
**[0:14:27-0:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:14:27):**  For instance, if a father wants his daughter to be a tennis player and all she wants to  
**[0:14:32-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:14:32):**  be is a dancer, he's probably put her on a psychologist couch for a number of years.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:14:40):**  So by actually paying attention to what the essence, the core patterns, the innermost  
**[0:14:46-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:14:46):**  drive of that living entity, whether it's a person or a city, we actually can work towards  
**[0:14:53-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:14:53):**  that and people can see that potential and they want to support that potential.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:14:57):**  So we help people see the potential, not the problems of their city or their ecosystem  
**[0:15:03-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:15:03):**  or their village.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:15:06):**  Then we actually enroll or engage people wherever they're interested.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:15:12):**  Climate change might be one area, mobility, social justice, gender equity, toxicants in  
**[0:15:18-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:15:18):**  the environment, pollution in the water, habitat connectivity, you name it, all those issues.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:15:23):**  There are hundreds of them.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:15:25):**  We find the people that are interested and energized about their particular issue and  
**[0:15:31-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:15:31):**  we bring them together.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:15:32):**  We integrate them in service of helping this city, town, village, ecosystem reach its whole,  
**[0:15:39-0:15:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:15:39):**  reach its potential.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:15:42):**  And that is something you can begin to see shifts right away because what's happening,  
**[0:15:51-0:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:15:51):**  number one, you're working at the individual level, people's ability to work together,  
**[0:15:54-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:15:54):**  you're working at the group level, people's ability to work as interpersonal skills and  
**[0:15:59-0:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:15:59):**  you're working in service of the system.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:16:01):**  We find that we need all those three levels, personal, interpersonal and system working  
**[0:16:07-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:16:07):**  in a coherent whole to actually create a long lasting and exciting level of engagement.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:16:18):**  Kind of giving you a recipe here.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:16:20):**  But it's never that straightforward but basically the principles are true.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:16:26):**  What's really interesting is that we rarely get governments who are interested in this  
**[0:16:30-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:16:30):**  because they have their own agenda.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:16:33):**  Governments are mostly about managing or individuals staying in office.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:16:37):**  They aren't really focused on the quality of life in the whole.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:16:40):**  What we find out is that by assembling groups of people in service of the health of this  
**[0:16:46-0:16:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:16:46):**  system, this here, how big is here, the governments actually come along afterwards and say we  
**[0:16:53-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:16:53):**  want to play too.  
**[0:16:56-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:16:56):**  We've had chambers of commerce who are not interested.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:16:59):**  We've had governments call us up 10, 12 months later and say we don't know how you're doing  
**[0:17:04-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:17:04):**  it but this is the best, this is the most exciting thing that's happened to this city  
**[0:17:07-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:17:07):**  in years.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:17:09):**  We want to play.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:17:10):**  They always want to come on board once the concept is proven and they know it can make  
**[0:17:14-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:17:14):**  them look good.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:17:16):**  Well that's true.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:17:17):**  But here's the other thing.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:17:18):**  What's really happening is we're building a field of, I'll go a little woo here, of  
**[0:17:24-0:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:17:24):**  positive energy.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:17:26):**  You know, you walk by a house with a party, you'd say it's a good party, it has positive  
**[0:17:31-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:17:31):**  energy right?  
**[0:17:32-0:17:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:17:32):**  You'd say wow I want to go there.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:17:34):**  Whereas if you walk by a conference room where they're having a pretty violent argument inside,  
**[0:17:38-0:17:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:17:38):**  you want to stay away.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:17:40):**  And that's an example of energy.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:17:41):**  Those are both examples of energy, good and bad energy.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:17:45):**  If you create a group of people working together coherently in the service of something larger  
**[0:17:49-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:17:49):**  and meaningful, you've created a field of energy that is a lot faster, a lot more transformative,  
**[0:17:57-0:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:17:57):**  much more quickly than any checklist of environmental metrics.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:18:03):**  When people talk about can you scale it, well you can't scale life.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:18:07):**  What you can do is build a field for life to want to propagate.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:18:12):**  And so that's why we emphasize the idea of field building.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:18:16):**  And it's not that the metrics are bad, not that we shouldn't use those metrics, it's  
**[0:18:20-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:18:20):**  just that they're insufficient in themselves unless they build a field.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:18:23):**  And those metrics actually can serve to build a field.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:18:27):**  But here's the final point is that you have to practice this.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:18:31):**  There's no such thing as a change management weekend or a change management charrette or  
**[0:18:36-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:18:36):**  a project that's going to change a community.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:18:39):**  It's basically a community that is in the service of this larger potential of the system.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:18:46):**  And out of that comes the guidance for the projects that we work on.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:18:51):**  It's not that the projects don't get built, but they get built being informed by new thinking.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:18:58):**  And then that thinking needs to be practiced forever.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:19:02):**  And so the final delivery of a regenerative project is to build the capacity and capability  
**[0:19:09-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:19:09):**  of the people in that place to co-evolve with each other and the place they live, the ecosystem  
**[0:19:16-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:19:16):**  they live within.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:19:17):**  I love that definition.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:19:18):**  I'm going to start working with that.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:19:21):**  That's good because that's the definition of regeneration.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:19:23):**  I mean that's not, it doesn't matter what we call it when you call it FRED.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:19:26):**  It's just that unless we are practicing co-evolutionary relationship, and that means forever, we will  
**[0:19:34-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:19:34):**  not have a regenerative condition, but certainly not a sustainable condition.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:19:39):**  Well, let's go back now to, since we're on definitions here, how that separates itself  
**[0:19:44-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:19:44):**  out from sustainability and restoration efforts.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:19:49):**  What are we trying to accomplish beyond those first two there?  
**[0:19:53-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:19:53):**  Okay, good.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:19:54):**  Pretty straightforward.  
**[0:19:55-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:19:55):**  Sustainability means that you are maintaining a system at its best.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:20:02):**  So maintenance is not a thriving life, by the way.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:20:08):**  Maintenance is just plodding along.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:20:09):**  And so when we make things efficient, like reducing energy use or reducing carbon in  
**[0:20:15-0:20:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:20:15):**  the atmosphere, let's say that we actually can get to zero.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:20:19):**  We will have just maybe luckily escaped with sustaining the planet, barely survival.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:20:28):**  You see my point?  
**[0:20:29-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:20:29):**  Yeah, it's definitely a diminished capacity there.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:20:32):**  So sustainability, as one wag said, sustainability is a slower way to die because we will never  
**[0:20:38-0:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:20:38):**  reach perfection.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:20:40):**  So sustainability as it's practiced today is an exercise in efficiency.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:20:46):**  Sustainability means that you're still doing bad, you're just doing it more slowly than  
**[0:20:51-0:20:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:20:51):**  bad, right?  
**[0:20:52-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:20:52):**  Correct.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:20:53):**  Okay, that's sustainability.  
**[0:20:56-0:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:20:56):**  Restoration gets us what we call above the line.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:20:58):**  It gets us into improving the existing condition.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:21:02):**  Now restoration by its, let me give you the geeky definition of restoration, it certainly  
**[0:21:07-0:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:21:07):**  does not mean restoring something to its original condition.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:21:11):**  Since life evolves, there is no original condition.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:21:15):**  But what it does mean, it means restoring an ecological subsystem, like a wetland, a  
**[0:21:22-0:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:21:22):**  forest, beach dune system, riparian corridor, that kind of thing.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:21:26):**  Restoring an ecological subsystem so that it has the self-organizing capability to evolve.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:21:33):**  That's restoration.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:21:36):**  Now how do we sustain restoration?  
**[0:21:40-0:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:21:40):**  Because if we as a community do not understand the workings of that system, why we restored  
**[0:21:46-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:21:46):**  it, why that wetland is important, why that forest is important, the next developer coming  
**[0:21:51-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:21:51):**  along with a shopping mall will say, well, we don't really need that wetland.  
**[0:21:55-0:21:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:21:55):**  So you rip it down or you destroy it.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:21:58):**  So restoration isn't a permanent condition.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:22:01):**  The only way that we can have a, well there's no such thing as a permanent condition, but  
**[0:22:04-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:22:04):**  the only way that we can actually protect ourselves from doing stupid things in the  
**[0:22:07-0:22:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:22:07):**  future is to continually rebirth our relationship and understanding of how life works in the  
**[0:22:14-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:22:14):**  place we live.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:22:18):**  So regeneration is a continual process of rebirthing, regenerating our relationship  
**[0:22:24-0:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:22:24):**  with place.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:22:26):**  And if it isn't rebirthed, let's just take an arbitrary timeframe.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:22:32):**  Every year, this is why New Year's can be a good thing, and take stock of what we've  
**[0:22:38-0:22:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:22:38):**  done and where we need to go, we will create a declining condition.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:22:43):**  So regeneration requires us to rebirth not only our relationship with the place we live,  
**[0:22:48-0:22:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:22:48):**  but it also requires us to rebirth our relationships with each other.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:22:52):**  Because if we're fighting each other, we're not going to pay any attention to the system  
**[0:22:55-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:22:55):**  we're part of.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:22:57):**  So it means, what's cool about it though is if you can get people to get excited about  
**[0:23:01-0:23:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:23:01):**  the place they live, it almost automatically takes care of, it doesn't automatically take  
**[0:23:07-0:23:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:23:07):**  care of it, but we then have the tools and the opportunity to begin to address the interpersonal  
**[0:23:12-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:23:12):**  relationships and the individual internal capability to develop as a good human being,  
**[0:23:20-0:23:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:23:20):**  or as a productive human being.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:23:23):**  So along those lines, how are you asking these questions that identify the highest potential  
**[0:23:30-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:23:30):**  for a place, a community, or whatever the parameter of here that you've defined might  
**[0:23:37-0:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:23:37):**  be?  
**[0:23:38-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:23:38):**  Do you have maybe an example you could give?  
**[0:23:39-0:23:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:23:39):**  Well, it's pretty straightforward.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:23:41):**  You look for patterns.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:23:43):**  So the skill set required for this work is tracking.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:23:48):**  Trackers are basically pattern recognizers.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:23:50):**  There's lots of trackers, scientists are trackers in their own way.  
**[0:23:54-0:23:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:23:54):**  Certainly animal trackers are trackers.  
**[0:23:56-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:23:56):**  But basically trackers don't identify just one track and call it a day.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:24:03):**  They actually have to identify multiple tracks to identify that the pattern actually supports  
**[0:24:07-0:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:24:07):**  their supposition based on the first track that they saw.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:24:10):**  So you need proof.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:24:12):**  So what we do is we look and we help the community look for the patterns that they keep seeing  
**[0:24:17-0:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:24:17):**  recurring over and over again, the deep patterns.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:24:21):**  So I'll give you one example, a short one, a town in the western slope of the Colorado  
**[0:24:28-0:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:24:28):**  Rockies had the most diverse ecosystem in one town we've ever seen, multiple, I mean,  
**[0:24:40-0:24:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:24:40):**  thousands of feet of elevation change, fjords, not really fjords, but deep river chasms,  
**[0:24:46-0:24:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:24:46):**  mountains, mountain tops, mesas, pasture lands, prairie lands, all in one town.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:24:53):**  They grew more crops than any place we'd ever seen, more diversity of wheat crops, fruit  
**[0:24:58-0:25:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:24:58):**  crops, animal crops, crops, animal herds.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:25:02):**  There were more churches in this town than any place in the United States, more churches  
**[0:25:07-0:25:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:25:07):**  and religions per capita than any place in the United States.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:25:10):**  When the Indians moved to this place, they divided into bands, very unusual for the Ute  
**[0:25:14-0:25:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:25:14):**  Indians, multiple families of the Ute tribe.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:25:18):**  So what we kept seeing was this pattern of fragmentation, but yet in a very positive  
**[0:25:23-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:25:23):**  way.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:25:24):**  They were self-organizing living niches within multiple diversity of these living niches.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:25:30):**  And so we called the core process of this place multiple self-organizing niches.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:25:36):**  Now that doesn't mean anything to anybody outside of this town, but that town got it.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:25:41):**  They said, yes, that's who we are.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:25:45):**  And to make a long story short, it actually – they were also the hippies, the religionists,  
**[0:25:53-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:25:53):**  the cowboys and the farmers.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:25:54):**  So there were four groups, self-identified groups in this town.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:25:59):**  And they were working on a school system.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:26:03):**  Basically they were worried because they were fracturing the town into multiple charter  
**[0:26:07-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:26:07):**  schools and homeschooling and public schooling and Catholic schools and school.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:26:14):**  And basically they realized they couldn't afford to be that fragmented.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:26:19):**  But they didn't know how to get out of it.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:26:20):**  So we were invited up there to help them understand the nature of their place because everybody  
**[0:26:24-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:26:24):**  loved this place.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:26:25):**  They loved the place they lived.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:26:28):**  And I'm really cutting out a lot of the story.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:26:30):**  But when we sat down with the community and explained what we had observed with their  
**[0:26:35-0:26:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:26:35):**  help, there was a woman in the back and she said, now I know why I hate this place.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:26:43):**  And everybody turns around at her and she says, you know what I mean.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:26:45):**  She says, I don't live here and I don't live here for a reason.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:26:49):**  I live here where there's one church, one crop, one meandering river.  
**[0:26:56-0:26:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:26:56):**  And they said, oh, that's so boring.  
**[0:26:57-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:26:57):**  And she said, exactly.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:26:58):**  That's the way I like it.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:27:00):**  And she said, you guys are always arguing with each other and which religion is true  
**[0:27:06-0:27:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:27:06):**  and farming practices and organic farming and mining and the hippies with their own  
**[0:27:11-0:27:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:27:11):**  organic food industry.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:27:13):**  Anyway, there's all this friction in the town.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:27:16):**  And they said, well, that's what we love.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:27:18):**  We love mixing it up with each other.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:27:20):**  And she said, exactly.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:27:21):**  That's why I live where I live and you live where you live.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:27:24):**  And don't get me wrong, I still love you guys.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:27:26):**  I come up here and I party with you guys all the time.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:27:28):**  It's not where I choose to live.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:27:30):**  Well, that recognition that they were fragmented for a reason that this is the nature of the  
**[0:27:37-0:27:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:27:37):**  place, actually they solved their school problem within a week afterwards because they had  
**[0:27:42-0:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:27:42):**  actually been working on the shadow side of what it meant to be this fractious town instead  
**[0:27:47-0:27:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:27:47):**  of the side that actually brought them together, which is basically a whole bunch of pioneers  
**[0:27:52-0:27:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:27:52):**  coming together into a place where they love that pioneering spirit and yet still live  
**[0:27:59-0:28:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:27:59):**  with those frictions.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:28:02):**  So I know I'm making this way too short but I realize this is a short interview.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:28:07):**  So the point of this is that you can help – basically you're holding a mirror up  
**[0:28:11-0:28:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:28:11):**  to people and saying that the tile greeting from South Africa, I see you because what's  
**[0:28:18-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:28:18):**  happening is people are seeing themselves in the mirror for the first time.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:28:21):**  It's very difficult to see yourself.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:28:24):**  When we do that with a place, with a living system, people begin to fall in love or at  
**[0:28:28-0:28:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:28:28):**  least like with a system and part of.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:28:31):**  And that's the beginning of change because we have all the technologies we need in this  
**[0:28:36-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:28:36):**  planet right now to heal the planet.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:28:39):**  What we're missing is the will to do so.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:28:42):**  So what we're looking for in the clients we work with and the cities we work with is  
**[0:28:47-0:28:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:28:47):**  we're out there to develop their will to begin to evolve.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:28:53):**  Within this evolution, how does the built environment and our infrastructure play a  
**[0:28:58-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:28:58):**  key role within the interactions, the connections and as we've been talking about, the full  
**[0:29:07-0:29:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:29:07):**  potential of a place?  
**[0:29:08-0:29:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:29:08):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:29:09):**  Well, on the short and very unsatisfactory answer is the short term is we all need to  
**[0:29:16-0:29:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:29:16):**  build.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:29:17):**  And in each, every sheltering point can be an acupuncture point to heal the system if  
**[0:29:22-0:29:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:29:22):**  we engage the people in the community.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:29:25):**  The other side of this is that there's no such thing as zoning by right anymore.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:29:29):**  You don't have a right to build a building.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:29:31):**  Even if zoning gives you the theoretical approval, if the community doesn't want that building  
**[0:29:36-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:29:36):**  to be there, it's not going to be there.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:29:38):**  I certainly have examples of that here.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:29:41):**  Well, sure.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:29:42):**  And so that's why any building project is a community project, whether you like it or  
**[0:29:48-0:29:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:29:48):**  not.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:29:49):**  And so that's the opportunity of building.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:29:52):**  Now, the longer term, we can't keep building forever and expect to heal the earth, right?  
**[0:29:56-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:29:56):**  We can't cover the earth with 100 million Walmarts.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:30:00):**  So the big – the long story here is that by engaging people and understanding how life  
**[0:30:05-0:30:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:30:05):**  works in this place, the hope is that people will start realizing that there's a carrying  
**[0:30:11-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:30:11):**  capacity, just like the squirrels in my backyard, you know, basically can only survive with  
**[0:30:17-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:30:17):**  so many acorns.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:30:19):**  So we have to learn how to survive.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:30:22):**  The food is not inexhaustible, especially as climate change rears its head.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:30:29):**  We're going to have to be very sensitive to what the carrying capacity is of our place.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:30:32):**  Therefore, that will control population.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:30:34):**  That will control the way we build.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:30:36):**  That will control how we act and be on this planet.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:30:42):**  That's a long way off, but that's the long game of regeneration, Oliver.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:30:46):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:30:47):**  I mean, certainly you've got to keep those longer timeframes in mind when approaching  
**[0:30:51-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:30:51):**  any project.  
**[0:30:55-0:31:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:30:55):**  I'm interested in how design structures can sort of facilitate the communication, the  
**[0:31:02-0:31:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:31:02):**  evolution and the completion of goals or however you want to frame it of the affected communities  
**[0:31:10-0:31:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:31:10):**  that these infrastructure projects are placed into.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:31:14):**  Well, I mean, the simplistic answer is the building really doesn't matter in terms of  
**[0:31:22-0:31:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:31:22):**  what we – how we treat the environment.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:31:23):**  The lot more complex answer is, of course, the beauty is really important and our community  
**[0:31:27-0:31:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:31:27):**  has to be cohesive and coherent, right?  
**[0:31:30-0:31:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:31:30):**  So when developers come into a community and have no real ownership – that's not the  
**[0:31:34-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:31:34):**  right word – no real investment in a community, they're merchant developers and they put  
**[0:31:38-0:31:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:31:38):**  up anything and they walk away, right, as long as they make their money.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:31:42):**  We want to encourage community developers, developers that are there supporting the community  
**[0:31:47-0:31:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:31:47):**  with buildings and systems that are actually needed.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:31:50):**  So that's a pretty important distinction.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:31:53):**  So any infrastructure project – we work on billion dollar, multiple billion dollar  
**[0:31:58-0:32:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:31:58):**  projects – sewage plants, water projects, river restoration projects, that kind of thing  
**[0:32:07-0:32:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:32:07):**  – but any of those can be an opportunity to bring the community together to understand  
**[0:32:12-0:32:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:32:12):**  the processes of life and what needs to be recovered if we damage them and what needs  
**[0:32:16-0:32:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:32:16):**  to be supported once we bring them back to a level of self-organizing restoration.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:32:21):**  I don't know if I'm answering your question.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:32:24):**  Yeah, certainly.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:32:25):**  I mean, there's so many ways to approach it.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:32:28):**  I was really just looking for your perspective on that question.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:32:33):**  And one of the things that I've seen you talk about in previous interviews and such is the  
**[0:32:38-0:32:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:32:38):**  idea of the essence of humility in good design and how that is essential to approach whatever  
**[0:32:47-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:32:47):**  the parameters are for a project or an intention before starting.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:32:52):**  How has that sort of manifested in your process?  
**[0:32:55-0:33:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:32:55):**  Well, I would like to think I'm humble but of course that's probably the thing that indicates  
**[0:33:00-0:33:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:33:00):**  that I'm not.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:33:01):**  So I like what Kathie László, the sustainability thinker, says.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:33:09):**  Sustainability is an inside job.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:33:12):**  And boy, it's the biggest thing we all have to work on, right?  
**[0:33:16-0:33:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:33:16):**  Is that unless we are exercising love towards all life, we probably won't get into sustainable  
**[0:33:27-0:33:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:33:27):**  condition, regenerative condition, whatever you want to call it.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:33:32):**  So really this work is about what we call in our practice, a little psychological term,  
**[0:33:38-0:33:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:33:38):**  external considering.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:33:39):**  And, you know, how do we consider beyond ourselves?  
**[0:33:44-0:33:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:33:44):**  External considering is all about me, but external considering means it's all about  
**[0:33:47-0:33:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:33:47):**  how does this affect life?  
**[0:33:49-0:33:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:33:49):**  How does this affect you?  
**[0:33:50-0:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:33:50):**  How does this affect the watershed, the oak tree?  
**[0:33:55-0:33:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:33:55):**  We have to ask those questions.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:33:58):**  That is the generator of any good question, Oliver, is considering the question from an  
**[0:34:04-0:34:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:34:04):**  external viewpoint.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:34:06):**  Do you have a process in which you sort of open your own perspective up to those types  
**[0:34:12-0:34:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:34:12):**  of questions and do you have any particular questions that have helped you a lot in that  
**[0:34:17-0:34:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:34:17):**  kind of understanding and consideration?  
**[0:34:19-0:34:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:34:19):**  That's a good question.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:34:22):**  We certainly meditate on this work.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:34:25):**  This work is you have to manage your own state.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:34:29):**  We practice as an office.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:34:31):**  Who do we need to be when we go to certain clients in certain situations?  
**[0:34:37-0:34:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:34:37):**  Every situation is different.  
**[0:34:39-0:34:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:34:39):**  So we practice that being and we've had some pretty tough clients who are frankly – I  
**[0:34:46-0:34:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:34:46):**  had one woman say to me, you know I don't like you.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:34:48):**  You probably don't like me.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:34:49):**  The first time I ever met her because all the feed had been negotiated through her,  
**[0:34:57-0:34:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:34:57):**  multiple billionaires.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:34:59):**  So I met her the day our job started and her foot was out of her mouth, you know I don't  
**[0:35:03-0:35:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:35:03):**  like you.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:35:04):**  She had no reason to say that, but apparently she did.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:35:08):**  So that really set us off to a good start and I had to facilitate five family meetings  
**[0:35:13-0:35:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:35:13):**  with this family over the year and they were the last place I wanted to be with that woman  
**[0:35:17-0:35:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:35:17):**  there.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:35:18):**  But in order to make them successful, we had to basically get myself into the right being  
**[0:35:23-0:35:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:35:23):**  state to be there and they were great workshops.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:35:28):**  They were wonderful and at the end of three years later, the woman asked her son-in-law,  
**[0:35:32-0:35:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:35:32):**  she said, so why doesn't Bill Reed like me?  
**[0:35:35-0:35:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:35:35):**  She had no memory of saying that to me.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:35:38):**  Wow.  
**[0:35:39-0:35:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:35:39):**  And I wasn't mean to her.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:35:41):**  I just didn't want to open myself up to being told that she hated me.  
**[0:35:46-0:35:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:35:46):**  Nobody does, right?  
**[0:35:48-0:35:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:35:48):**  But yet it was the managing of that being state that allowed her to ask that question  
**[0:35:52-0:35:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:35:52):**  three years later.  
**[0:35:54-0:35:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:35:54):**  So this work is inner work, really.  
**[0:35:57-0:35:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:35:57):**  I completely agree.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:35:59):**  That's a wonderful sort of idea and perspective on this and I've often sort of thought about  
**[0:36:06-0:36:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:36:06):**  this as a role of a designer and as I've worked with clients increasingly over the last few  
**[0:36:10-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:36:10):**  years and define these parameters within what they're trying to accomplish, but also what's  
**[0:36:16-0:36:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:36:16):**  needed within the larger community and the affected connections by starting to take active  
**[0:36:22-0:36:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:36:22):**  steps on a project, realizing that your own personal hang-ups and emotional issues and  
**[0:36:29-0:36:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:36:29):**  possibly your own agenda or ego can be a big factor in that design process and getting  
**[0:36:35-0:36:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:36:35):**  in touch with sort of what part of that energy flow or that creative process you personally  
**[0:36:43-0:36:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:36:43):**  are inhibiting by the state of being that you happen to be in in that time is, like  
**[0:36:48-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:36:48):**  you said, it's where the internal work needs to catch up with the rest of that process.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:36:54):**  Yeah.  
**[0:36:55-0:36:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:36:55):**  And it's just not sensitivity though.  
**[0:36:57-0:37:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:36:57):**  It's just not saying, oh, I feel your pain, you know, or that's an aspect of it.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:37:02):**  What's important is sensitivity allows one to be conscious of patterns, right?  
**[0:37:07-0:37:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:37:07):**  If it's no longer just about you, if you're looking outward, you can see patterns much  
**[0:37:12-0:37:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:37:12):**  more readily than being insecure about, you know, how am I doing?  
**[0:37:15-0:37:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:37:15):**  Do they like me?  
**[0:37:18-0:37:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:37:18):**  That would be internal considering.  
**[0:37:21-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:37:21):**  But external considering is, you know, you are not what's important.  
**[0:37:25-0:37:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:37:25):**  What's important are these patterns there and you're helping people see those patterns.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:37:29):**  And then how do we become conscious of what those patterns mean?  
**[0:37:33-0:37:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:37:33):**  And then how do we become creative in solving them and addressing them?  
**[0:37:38-0:37:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:37:38):**  So those are levels of engagement that are different than just, you know, putting your  
**[0:37:46-0:37:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:37:46):**  arm around somebody and saying, you know, I really care about you.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:37:48):**  Well, it's wonderful to care.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:37:49):**  But now we got to do something.  
**[0:37:51-0:37:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:37:51):**  We've got some work to do, folks.  
**[0:37:52-0:37:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:37:52):**  Right.  
**[0:37:53-0:37:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:37:53):**  What is the verb after caring?  
**[0:37:54-0:37:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:37:54):**  How do you express that?  
**[0:37:55-0:37:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:37:55):**  How does that manifest?  
**[0:37:56-0:37:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:37:56):**  Yeah, well, caring is active.  
**[0:37:57-0:38:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:37:57):**  You know, it's interesting to me how you define the word, but compassion is or empathy, right.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:38:04):**  But caring is an active, an active empathy.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:38:08):**  So how do we actively engage in the process of caring is really what this works about.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:38:14):**  Yeah.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:38:15):**  Now, for a lot of my listeners, moving towards a regenerative lifestyle is a goal that that  
**[0:38:22-0:38:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:38:22):**  a lot of us share in your perspective.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:38:24):**  What are some active steps that either through asking questions or identifying patterns within  
**[0:38:30-0:38:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:38:30):**  our own lives, can we start to make that transition ourselves?  
**[0:38:34-0:38:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:38:34):**  Well, geez, I'm glad you don't have a movie camera.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:38:38):**  I can film my levels of hypocrisy.  
**[0:38:44-0:38:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:38:44):**  We all have them.  
**[0:38:45-0:38:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:38:45):**  Yeah, we do.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:38:46):**  We all have our flat spots, as a friend says.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:38:51):**  For me, and you may resonate to this, we've turned our yard into a New England forest,  
**[0:38:57-0:38:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:38:57):**  right.  
**[0:38:58-0:39:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:38:58):**  So we're interested in how do we propagate habitat and then be an example to others.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:39:02):**  So that's at the simplest level and of course all the green technologies and energy efficiencies,  
**[0:39:08-0:39:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:39:08):**  which we live in a very old house, so it's a little tough to do.  
**[0:39:11-0:39:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:39:11):**  But nonetheless, I think the most important thing beyond all those surface features is  
**[0:39:17-0:39:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:39:17):**  how do we help build community in service of what?  
**[0:39:23-0:39:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:39:23):**  And this is where my hypocrisy comes in, because I'm doing it everywhere else in the world  
**[0:39:26-0:39:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:39:26):**  and never at home.  
**[0:39:27-0:39:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:39:27):**  I'm like the cobblers shoes don't have shoes.  
**[0:39:32-0:39:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:39:32):**  Cobblers kids don't have shoes.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:39:35):**  But that's my intention, and I'm offering this to others, is to help build your community  
**[0:39:42-0:39:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:39:42):**  to serve the potential it is possible capable of both socially and environmentally, the  
**[0:39:50-0:39:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:39:50):**  ecology as a whole, the socio-ecological system.  
**[0:39:53-0:40:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:39:53):**  How can you bring this place, this living organism we call home, so that it is healthy  
**[0:40:01-0:40:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:40:01):**  on an evolutionary basis?  
**[0:40:02-0:40:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:40:02):**  This is a big question.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:40:04):**  We need to all be asking ourselves.  
**[0:40:06-0:40:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:40:06):**  You know there are only 4200 cities in the world larger than 100,000 people, Oliver.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:40:13):**  That's not many.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:40:14):**  Now there are a million and a half hamlets, cities town smaller than that.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:40:19):**  But if we got 2% of those 4200 cities in the world to have a regenerative internal relationship,  
**[0:40:29-0:40:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:40:29):**  a regenerative situation, that's considered by many to be a tipping point.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:40:37):**  So it's not that many.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:40:39):**  No, it makes it sound almost reachable.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:40:42):**  Yeah, and as long as we stop, we need to stop talking about saving the planet.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:40:46):**  I mean we can't stop talking about it, but it doesn't mean much.  
**[0:40:49-0:40:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:40:49):**  It's very abstract.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:40:50):**  I'm going to save the planet.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:40:51):**  The question is what can you do in your place?  
**[0:40:55-0:40:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:40:55):**  That aggregation is what will save the planet.  
**[0:40:57-0:41:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:40:57):**  And I'm so glad that you brought that up because as you mentioned earlier, New Year's can sometimes  
**[0:41:01-0:41:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:41:01):**  be a good time to redefine the parameters and the goals and intentions in which you're  
**[0:41:07-0:41:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:41:07):**  working.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:41:08):**  These, even if they are invented timeline checkpoints, they can serve as a good way  
**[0:41:13-0:41:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:41:13):**  of sort of getting on track or touching in with your compass.  
**[0:41:16-0:41:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:41:16):**  And what you mentioned about focusing in on, like you said, you've been doing this work  
**[0:41:22-0:41:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:41:22):**  for all sorts of other communities and could possibly take more time into your own.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:41:27):**  That's exactly what I've been going through as well as figuring out how much of my time  
**[0:41:30-0:41:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:41:30):**  to continue to devote to client work and projects that kind of take me mind and body at different  
**[0:41:37-0:41:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:41:37):**  times away from the community that I've decided to call home.  
**[0:41:42-0:41:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:41:42):**  And definitely moving forward into 2019, I'm hoping to have a better balance of that because  
**[0:41:50-0:41:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:41:50):**  if I'm going to be offering advice and perspective on other people's regenerative development  
**[0:41:54-0:42:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:41:54):**  and I have somehow fallen far behind in my own relationship to the community that I've  
**[0:42:00-0:42:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:42:00):**  called home, I can't imagine that my advice is going to be terribly well informed or come  
**[0:42:05-0:42:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:42:05):**  from a lot of hard experience.  
**[0:42:07-0:42:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:42:07):**  Well, don't be entirely hard on yourself because you learn a lot.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:42:12):**  I fall in love with every community I work in because when you start to understand any  
**[0:42:17-0:42:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:42:17):**  place, any body or any place, you can't but help fall in love.  
**[0:42:22-0:42:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:42:22):**  So the learning is tremendous and you also can only lead a horse to water.  
**[0:42:30-0:42:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:42:30):**  You can't make him drink.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:42:31):**  So you got to find the opportunities appropriate.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:42:34):**  It may happen in your community but you can encourage it to happen.  
**[0:42:37-0:42:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:42:37):**  Give yourself a little bit of slack.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:42:40):**  Never.  
**[0:42:41-0:42:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:42:41):**  I refuse.  
**[0:42:42-0:42:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:42:42):**  Okay, we're good.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:42:43):**  I'll hold myself to higher standards.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:42:46):**  Good.  
**[0:42:47-0:42:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:42:47):**  Well, good.  
**[0:42:48-0:42:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:42:48):**  I'll support that in all of it.  
**[0:42:51-0:43:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:42:51):**  But anyway, I've learned a tremendous amount and now I may be capable of taking this home  
**[0:43:00-0:43:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:43:00):**  in a different way.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:43:02):**  I live in Boston.  
**[0:43:03-0:43:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:43:03):**  It's a different area.  
**[0:43:04-0:43:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:43:04):**  There's a lot of advanced thinking going on.  
**[0:43:06-0:43:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:43:06):**  But here's the other issue is you have a lot of really good things going on that's so good  
**[0:43:12-0:43:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:43:12):**  that people don't think they need to think anymore.  
**[0:43:15-0:43:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:43:15):**  So, in a way, I try to go where there's a lot more perceived need than the places that  
**[0:43:23-0:43:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:43:23):**  are already doing a pretty good job.  
**[0:43:24-0:43:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:43:24):**  Even though they're not doing an adequate job, they're doing a better job than a lot  
**[0:43:27-0:43:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:43:27):**  of other places.  
**[0:43:28-0:43:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:43:28):**  Let them keep going until they're ready to ask the question because you're not going  
**[0:43:32-0:43:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:43:32):**  to work with anybody until there is what we call a restraint, until somebody says, you  
**[0:43:37-0:43:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:43:37):**  know, we got a problem here or boy, our city is dying or this river is so polluted, we  
**[0:43:43-0:43:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:43:43):**  don't know what to do.  
**[0:43:45-0:43:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:43:45):**  Those are the places you have a leg up.  
**[0:43:49-0:43:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:43:49):**  People need the help.  
**[0:43:51-0:43:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:43:51):**  Now, you've been very generous with your time so far.  
**[0:43:54-0:43:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:43:54):**  I just have one more question before we wrap it up.  
**[0:43:57-0:44:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:43:57):**  What keeps you motivated to work on this?  
**[0:44:01-0:44:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:44:01):**  This is such a broad topic and is going to require so much work from so many people to  
**[0:44:08-0:44:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:44:08):**  really get our society, our cultural narrative on track with one that is no longer destructive  
**[0:44:13-0:44:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:44:13):**  just to start.  
**[0:44:15-0:44:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:44:15):**  What keeps you motivated to keep trying to make this better?  
**[0:44:17-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:44:17):**  Well, it's a good question.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:44:19):**  I wonder that myself sometimes.  
**[0:44:21-0:44:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:44:21):**  I've been doing this for 35 years.  
**[0:44:26-0:44:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:44:26):**  And truthfully, I'm getting older, so it's a little tough to maintain the energy level.  
**[0:44:31-0:44:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:44:31):**  But I'll tell you, I can't go back.  
**[0:44:33-0:44:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:44:33):**  You can't go back to fragmented thinking once you learn to work with holes.  
**[0:44:43-0:44:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:44:43):**  And so, I can't not do this.  
**[0:44:49-0:44:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:44:49):**  Am I concerned that we're too late?  
**[0:44:51-0:44:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:44:51):**  Yep, I think we are already too late.  
**[0:44:53-0:44:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:44:53):**  But nonetheless, whoever is going to be left, and there will be people left on this planet,  
**[0:44:58-0:45:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:44:58):**  and we all die anyway, how do we build that capacity for longevity and meaningful human  
**[0:45:09-0:45:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:45:09):**  development?  
**[0:45:11-0:45:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:45:11):**  So we have to seed it.  
**[0:45:14-0:45:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:45:14):**  And if we're not seeding it, who else is going to seed it?  
**[0:45:18-0:45:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:45:18):**  So I consider this a Johnny Appleseed venture.  
**[0:45:22-0:45:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:45:22):**  I like that.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:45:23):**  That's so funny because it echoes a lot with what I talk about with my business partners  
**[0:45:27-0:45:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:45:27):**  here.  
**[0:45:28-0:45:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:45:28):**  It's like, there are so many bits of information and new research coming out that can be horribly  
**[0:45:33-0:45:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:45:33):**  pessimistic and there are definitely times when I'm like, yeah, we've probably already  
**[0:45:38-0:45:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:45:38):**  crossed over the tipping point.  
**[0:45:39-0:45:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:45:39):**  But at the same time, yeah, you can't think in a different way when you start to see the  
**[0:45:43-0:45:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:45:43):**  connections on a much broader scale.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:45:46):**  And yeah, there doesn't seem to be a much better alternative of what to do with my time.  
**[0:45:51-0:45:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:45:51):**  I wasn't doing anything terribly interesting other than this, so might as well keep going  
**[0:45:56-0:45:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:45:56):**  with it.  
**[0:45:57-0:46:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:45:57):**  Yeah, you know, I thought I'll go to get on a sailboat and that would last for a week.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:46:02):**  And I would say, oh, I've got to do something productive.  
**[0:46:04-0:46:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:46:04):**  I know, see, I've already done a bunch of that stuff.  
**[0:46:07-0:46:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:46:07):**  Like I've been traveling for 14 years.  
**[0:46:08-0:46:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:46:08):**  I've done all the adventure stuff.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:46:10):**  I've had a lot of those experiences that people have on their bucket list.  
**[0:46:15-0:46:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:46:15):**  And yeah, when a whole it's a whole life that revolves around that, it's oddly boring.  
**[0:46:20-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:46:20):**  Like you'd be disappointed.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:46:21):**  Yes, it is.  
**[0:46:22-0:46:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:46:22):**  But so but here's the other side.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:46:23):**  Here's the cool side is that I've traveled the world in this service.  
**[0:46:27-0:46:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:46:27):**  So I get to see the world doing this kind of work.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:46:30):**  Yeah, that's exactly.  
**[0:46:32-0:46:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:46:32):**  That's that's totally what motivates me to keep traveling now, too, is like, how can  
**[0:46:36-0:46:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:46:36):**  I engage with these other communities, these other ecosystems and have a positive impact  
**[0:46:41-0:46:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:46:41):**  on them?  
**[0:46:42-0:46:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:46:42):**  It's reignited my interest in in traveling in general, because now there's actually something  
**[0:46:48-0:46:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:46:48):**  to do rather than just go and observe and see.  
**[0:46:51-0:46:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:46:51):**  Although that is a big portion that you can't neglect if you want to do anything positive.  
**[0:46:56-0:46:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:46:56):**  Yeah, but living, you know, I just I've always found it.  
**[0:46:59-0:47:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:46:59):**  I mean, I do the tourist thing now and then, but I always typically find it boring.  
**[0:47:04-0:47:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:47:04):**  What is really fun is being part of the warp and roof of the fabric of the community and  
**[0:47:09-0:47:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:47:09):**  working with you see so much more and learn so much more by working in the community.  
**[0:47:16-0:47:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:47:16):**  So it's the best tourism of you.  
**[0:47:18-0:47:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:47:18):**  It really is.  
**[0:47:20-0:47:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:47:20):**  Yeah, that's beautifully said.  
**[0:47:21-0:47:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:47:21):**  All right.  
**[0:47:22-0:47:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:47:22):**  Well, before I let you go, Bill, can you tell our listeners how they can get in touch with  
**[0:47:26-0:47:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:47:26):**  you and find out more about your work?  
**[0:47:29-0:47:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:47:29):**  Go to our website, regenesisgroup.com.  
**[0:47:31-0:47:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:47:31):**  Marvelous.  
**[0:47:32-0:47:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:47:32):**  Hope that's sufficient.  
**[0:47:34-0:47:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:47:34):**  Yeah, that should do.  
**[0:47:35-0:47:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:47:35):**  Well, again, Bill, thank you so much for your time.  
**[0:47:38-0:47:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:47:38):**  It's been wonderful getting to talk to you.  
**[0:47:40-0:47:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:47:40):**  Finally, I've been a follower and a fan of your work since I found it a few years ago.  
**[0:47:45-0:47:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:47:45):**  And this has been a very engaging conversation.  
**[0:47:47-0:47:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:47:47):**  I hope we can catch up again sometime soon.  
**[0:47:49-0:47:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:47:49):**  Thanks, all.  
**[0:47:50-0:47:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:47:50):**  Glad to do so.  
**[0:47:51-0:47:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:47:51):**  Appreciate the time.  
**[0:47:52-0:47:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:47:52):**  All right.  
**[0:47:53-0:47:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:47:53):**  Take care.  
**[0:47:54-0:47:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:47:54):**  See you.  
**[0:47:55-0:47:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-bill-reed/#t=0:47:55):**  Bye.

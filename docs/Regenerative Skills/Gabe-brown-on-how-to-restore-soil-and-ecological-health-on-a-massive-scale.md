**[0:00:31-0:00:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:00:31):**  arable crops for some of the clients that I have, and Gabe's work over the last 20  
**[0:00:35-0:00:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:00:35):**  years really stands out as an incredible example of this kind of potential.

**[0:00:47-0:00:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:00:47):**  Like any other success story, it's worth taking special care to understand the mindset  
**[0:00:51-0:00:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:00:51):**  and the decision-making process more than any individual technique or practice that  
**[0:00:55-0:00:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:00:55):**  these people implemented.  
**[0:00:57-0:01:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:00:57):**  This interview I think is a great peek into the mind that took a hard turn against the  
**[0:01:01-0:01:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:01:01):**  common practices around him and remained incredibly tenacious through a challenging transition  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:01:07):**  process to more regenerative and ecologically aligned management.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:01:11):**  So I'll start things off with the original introduction.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:01:16):**  A lot of the farms that come to mind when I think of regenerative agriculture are smaller,  
**[0:01:20-0:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:01:20):**  more diverse, and quite intensive, many with different crops and animals working in closer  
**[0:01:25-0:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:01:25):**  proximity with many stacked functions and a niche business model.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:01:29):**  But what can be done for all of those vast fields of monoculture plantings like corn,  
**[0:01:34-0:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:01:34):**  soy, and wheat that take up so much space in the heartland of the midwestern and western

**[0:03:03-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:03:03):**  He also tells me a lot about the invisible challenges to his way of farming, such as  
**[0:03:08-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:03:08):**  the counterproductive incentives of the US Farm Bill and the cultural stigma that can

**[0:03:16-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:03:16):**  We also dig into some of the crucial advice that Gabe has for farmers looking to make  
**[0:03:20-0:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:03:20):**  a transition to regenerative agriculture from industrial management.

**[0:03:28-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:03:28):**  risking food shortages or spikes in food costs.

**[0:03:35-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:03:35):**  who you know who works in farming, or perhaps hasn't heard of these possibilities, or  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:03:39):**  who thinks that their mechanized monoculture operations can't be converted or don't  
**[0:03:44-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:03:44):**  lend themselves to ecological transformation.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:03:47):**  So with that out of the way, I'll hand things over now to Gabe Brown.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:03:51):**  Hey Gabe, thank you so much for making time to be on the podcast today.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:03:54):**  I've got so many questions because of all of the experience and the success that you've  
**[0:03:58-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:03:58):**  had through regenerative farming methods and that you've been such a powerful voice, especially  
**[0:04:03-0:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:04:03):**  in the Midwest and people with larger acreage who are looking to implement this on traditional  
**[0:04:08-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:04:08):**  or industrial farming methods.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:04:10):**  So what do you say we just get down to the questions?  
**[0:04:12-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:04:12):**  Sure.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:04:13):**  All right, so look, before we get started, can you tell us a little bit about your personal  
**[0:04:18-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:04:18):**  background and what got you interested in managing your land in what was quite an alternative  
**[0:04:24-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:04:24):**  way when you first started?  
**[0:04:26-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:04:26):**  Okay.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:04:27):**  So I did not grow up on a farmer ranch.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:04:32):**  I grew up in town and I became interested in agriculture when I was in high school and  
**[0:04:38-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:04:38):**  started working on farms.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:04:41):**  And I went off to the university and I actually was going to be a agricultural education instructor,  
**[0:04:47-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:04:47):**  in other words, a teacher.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:04:49):**  And as luck would have it, I married my high school sweetheart and she was from a farm  
**[0:04:55-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:04:55):**  and she has two sisters, but her no brothers.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:05:01):**  So her parents asked us if we'd be interested in moving back to the farm and perhaps taking  
**[0:05:09-0:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:05:09):**  it over.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:05:10):**  And so once I graduated from college, that's what we did.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:05:14):**  We moved back to the farm and I actually learned how to farm from my father-in-law.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:05:19):**  He farmed very conventionally.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:05:21):**  In other words, it was a lot of tillage and synthetic fertilizers, monoculture, small  
**[0:05:29-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:05:29):**  grain production, not a lot of diversity.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:05:33):**  And that's how I learned to farm.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:05:35):**  Well, I started renting some land on my own and I farmed just like he did.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:05:41):**  Then we ended up purchasing a part of the farm from them in 1991 and I continued to  
**[0:05:48-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:05:48):**  farm that way.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:05:49):**  Then what happened was a series of natural disasters.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:05:53):**  Well, I should step back for a second.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:05:58):**  What happened in 1994, I had read a lot about no till.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:06:05):**  And in our environment, moisture is fairly limited.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:06:08):**  We get approximately 16 inches of total precipitation a year.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:06:14):**  And I knew that I could save and conserve some moisture by going no till.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:06:19):**  So I purchased a no till drill and went to 100% no till.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:06:24):**  I just jumped in.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:06:25):**  I had to sell my tillage equipment in order to be able to afford that no till drill.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:06:31):**  So I was totally bought in and we started no tilling.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:06:35):**  Then what happened in 1995, we were no tilling.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:06:40):**  I started to diversify the crop rotation a little bit.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:06:43):**  We lost 100% of our crop to hail.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:06:47):**  And so I had no crop income.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:06:49):**  1996 came along and we lost 100% of our crop to hail again.  
**[0:06:56-0:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:06:56):**  1997 came along and we dried out.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:06:59):**  It was very limited moisture.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:07:01):**  Nobody combined anything in our area.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:07:04):**  So I was three years of no grain income.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:07:08):**  I did have a few beef cattle, so was making a little bit of money that way.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:07:13):**  But obviously the banker wasn't going to loan me money anymore because I hadn't paid him  
**[0:07:18-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:07:18):**  back yet.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:07:19):**  I was thankful that he didn't foreclose on me.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:07:22):**  1998 came along and we lost 80% of our crop to hail.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:07:26):**  So those four years of natural disaster were really teaching me some lessons.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:07:33):**  And I tell people that laid the foundation.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:07:37):**  It forced me to learn how ecosystems function and how can I make this land productive without  
**[0:07:48-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:07:48):**  all these added inputs, without buying the commercial fertilizers and pesticides and  
**[0:07:54-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:07:54):**  fungicides and everything else.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:07:57):**  And I tell people in my book, it was really a journey.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:08:01):**  And it's a never-ending learning experience.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:08:04):**  I'm learning new things every year.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:08:07):**  But the more I observed nature and learned how nature functions, the more I realized  
**[0:08:14-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:08:14):**  that my task as a farmer, as a rancher was to be a good steward of the land and figure  
**[0:08:21-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:08:21):**  out how can I work best with nature instead of against her.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:08:26):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:08:27):**  And I think that's a common motivation for a lot of people who are looking to make this  
**[0:08:31-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:08:31):**  change in the way that they're managing their land.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:08:35):**  Now going back to your initial motivations for switching over to no-till, you said because  
**[0:08:41-0:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:08:41):**  you're in an area with such restricted precipitation, that no-till made sense to conserve more moisture  
**[0:08:48-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:08:48):**  in the ground.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:08:49):**  But then it was followed by those four years of disaster.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:08:53):**  How did you start to get the feedback that this was the way to go when you didn't have  
**[0:08:58-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:08:58):**  a crop to show any results for that amount of time?  
**[0:09:03-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:09:03):**  What sort of made you persevere past this disaster?  
**[0:09:08-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:09:08):**  That's a very good question.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:09:10):**  And looking back now, I realized that what was really happening was I was seeing the  
**[0:09:16-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:09:16):**  principles laid out before me.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:09:19):**  I'd already gone down the no-till path, so least amount of mechanical disturbance possible.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:09:29):**  Because I got hailed out, there was no need to apply the herbicides.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:09:35):**  So that's another part of the first principle, least amount of mechanical chemical disturbance  
**[0:09:39-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:09:39):**  possible.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:09:41):**  Then the hailstorms were actually laying down tremendous amount of biomass onto the soil  
**[0:09:46-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:09:46):**  surface, just through the hail actually pounding that above-ground biomass down onto the surface.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:09:53):**  Well that's the second principle, armoring the soil.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:09:58):**  Then what was also happening, I realized I had a herd of beef cattle, I needed to feed  
**[0:10:03-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:10:03):**  them.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:10:04):**  Well, I started to grow forage crops specifically for feed for the livestock.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:10:13):**  Fennel crops such as sorghum, sedan grass, cowpeas, alfalfa and millet.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:10:20):**  And so I was adding diversity at that time.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:10:26):**  That is the third principle.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:10:29):**  Then what happened after the hailstorms, hail beat the crop down, I needed forage for the  
**[0:10:36-0:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:10:36):**  livestock.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:10:37):**  I'd scrape together a little money, buy some millet and cowpea seed.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:10:42):**  And to feed that, well, what I was doing was adding a living root into the soil as long  
**[0:10:48-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:10:48):**  as possible throughout the year.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:10:51):**  Then I would graze that in late fall and winter with livestock.  
**[0:10:55-0:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:10:55):**  So those are the fourth and fifth principles.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:10:58):**  So I was really learning the lesson of these principles of a healthy soil ecosystem.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:11:06):**  It seems like not having an income from the crop still gave you a lot of very quick feedback  
**[0:11:11-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:11:11):**  as to how closing the loops in your systems on the farm were adding to the overall value  
**[0:11:17-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:11:17):**  and the resilience of the land, if I'm understanding you correctly.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:11:22):**  That's exactly right.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:11:23):**  The other thing I was seeing is that all of a sudden there were earthworms in my soil.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:11:30):**  Well, my father-in-law, I tell people that my father-in-law practiced recreational tillage.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:11:36):**  He'd go and till just for the fun of it.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:11:39):**  He enjoyed doing that.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:11:41):**  But you'd never see an earthworm in any of our soil.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:11:43):**  Well, now because I had been no till, no disturbance because the soil was covered, because there  
**[0:11:49-0:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:11:49):**  was living roots, all of a sudden the soil was coming back to life.  
**[0:11:55-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:11:55):**  And it wasn't only below ground insects, biology like earthworms.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:12:01):**  It was above ground also.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:12:03):**  This farm here, we used to never see deer on the farm.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:12:08):**  All of a sudden I was starting to see deer and pheasants and grouse and all these bird  
**[0:12:12-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:12:12):**  populations and they were coming for a reason.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:12:16):**  The reason was there was habitat for them.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:12:19):**  So I started noticing a lot more life and I tell people it's much more enjoyable working  
**[0:12:25-0:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:12:25):**  with life than with death.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:12:27):**  So that was, you know, obviously the lack of income was a struggle, but I was noticing  
**[0:12:36-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:12:36):**  enough positive changes that I felt confident I was headed down the right path.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:12:42):**  Hmm.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:12:43):**  Yeah, all of those indicators must have been a real encouragement despite the lack of income.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:12:49):**  So look, one of the things that I hear about a lot from people who especially have worked  
**[0:12:53-0:12:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:12:53):**  on degraded land in an attempt to regenerate the health of the soil, especially places  
**[0:12:59-0:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:12:59):**  that have seen prolific tillage for many years, is that the soil can develop quite a hard  
**[0:13:05-0:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:13:05):**  pan just below the surface of where the tillage has been.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:13:09):**  Has that been a big issue in the way that you've had to manage or adapt your strategies  
**[0:13:15-0:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:13:15):**  to repair the health of the soil, especially when it comes to water infiltration and roots  
**[0:13:21-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:13:21):**  being able to get through that hard pan?  
**[0:13:24-0:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:13:24):**  One of the things I learned early on, well, there was many, many things, but I learned  
**[0:13:30-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:13:30):**  early on that although I had spent four years at the university studying agriculture, I  
**[0:13:37-0:13:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:13:37):**  really didn't know agriculture.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:13:40):**  I learned the chemical and physical components, you know, that soil, sand, silt, and clay,  
**[0:13:47-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:13:47):**  and that there's nutrients that are needed by a plant, but I did not learn at the university  
**[0:13:54-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:13:54):**  how soil functions.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:13:57):**  I didn't learn that plants, you know, we all learned way back that plants through photosynthesis  
**[0:14:04-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:14:04):**  convert sunlight into all these carbon compounds, but I didn't learn that a plant then moves  
**[0:14:10-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:14:10):**  some of those compounds down into its roots and exudes them out into the soil in order

**[0:17:09-0:17:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:17:09):**  And you respond by saying, well, you wouldn't ask, they wouldn't ask you to pick their spouse.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:17:14):**  You shouldn't be picking their cover crops either.

**[0:17:21-0:17:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:17:21):**  in which everybody is working.

**[0:17:29-0:17:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:17:29):**  varieties and figured out what cover crops work for your specific context.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:17:37):**  That's right.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:17:38):**  And the last word you said, context, is critical.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:17:42):**  As a matter of fact, we've added the sixth principle and that principle is context.

**[0:17:55-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:17:55):**  in the world where there's dry land agriculture.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:17:59):**  What is different is the tools we use to put those principles into play.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:18:06):**  So over where you're at, you may not grow the same cash grain crops that I grow.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:18:12):**  You may not grow the same cover crops because all climates are different and soil types

**[0:18:25-0:18:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:18:25):**  all have to be taken into account when you determine what it is you grow.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:18:31):**  Like here in North Dakota, we only have approximately 110 frost-free days a year.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:18:37):**  Well, I'm limited in the amount of warm season species I can use and I certainly cannot use  
**[0:18:44-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:18:44):**  any tropical species in our environment.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:18:48):**  We just don't get hot enough and we're not wet enough for those.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:18:52):**  So you have to put it in context.

**[0:19:15-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:19:15):**  into the country and I tried some and I tell people that was a real shock because it looked  
**[0:19:22-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:19:22):**  like marijuana growing and people were just amazed that I'd grow such thing.

**[0:19:34-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:19:34):**  needs a long growing season.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:19:36):**  We have neither of those.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:19:38):**  So that one I don't even bother attempting to grow anymore.

**[0:19:57-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:19:57):**  to pay for an education but I'm not going to gamble my whole ranch on it.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:20:02):**  So we'll try a couple new species every year in a mix just to see how they do.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:20:08):**  If they fail me once, I will try them again.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:20:11):**  If they fail me twice, I generally do not try them again.

**[0:20:21-0:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:20:21):**  makes farming ranching exciting because you're trying new things, you're seeing new things.

**[0:20:33-0:20:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:20:33):**  I mean, well over 150 different species, I'm sure, but there's just a small number of those,  
**[0:20:44-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:20:44):**  probably less than 50 that I use on a regular basis.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:20:50):**  And so you try, you learn and then you react accordingly.  
**[0:20:55-0:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:20:55):**  Tell me just for reference what some of those species that you've had real success with  
**[0:20:58-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:20:58):**  are because of the really limited context that you're in.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:21:01):**  They must be pretty hardy.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:21:03):**  Yeah, so we use a lot of the cool season species because we're in a cool season and dominant  
**[0:21:09-0:21:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:21:09):**  environment.

**[0:21:18-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:21:18):**  triticale, cereal rye.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:21:21):**  The clovers tend to do real well here.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:21:24):**  The majority of clovers.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:21:27):**  Then we will use some millet, some sudan grass, cowpeas.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:21:33):**  The brassicas work well in our environment.

**[0:21:40-0:21:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:21:40):**  That's just a handful of the ones we use.

**[0:22:18-0:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:22:18):**  Sure.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:22:19):**  One of the things about me is I really enjoy learning and I'm an avid reader.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:22:24):**  I read one to two books every week.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:22:28):**  Avery had come to North America and he was promoting holistic plan grazing.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:22:34):**  Well I read about it.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:22:36):**  It made sense to me and so on a limited basis I started doing some cross fencing, realized  
**[0:22:44-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:22:44):**  I did not own the land at the time.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:22:46):**  It was slow and a bit difficult to get my father-in-law to believe in it.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:22:51):**  So I started slowly.  
**[0:22:53-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:22:53):**  I started rotationally grazing, moving the livestock about once a month.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:23:00):**  Well then after we purchased a part of the ranch from them, then I accelerated that and  
**[0:23:06-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:23:06):**  started moving a little more frequently, about once a week.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:23:11):**  And I was pretty comfortable with that and that's what I was doing through the 90s, early  
**[0:23:17-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:23:17):**  2000s.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:23:18):**  And then I had the good fortune that I met Neil Dennis from Canada and Neil was grazing  
**[0:23:28-0:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:23:28):**  up to a million pounds of live weight per acre, doing multiple moves per day.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:23:35):**  And I went up to Neil's in 2006 and I saw what he was doing and I immediately knew that  
**[0:23:41-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:23:41):**  that was the missing link on my cropland.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:23:44):**  I needed to move more frequently and I needed to integrate high stock density livestock  
**[0:23:50-0:23:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:23:50):**  grazing onto the cropland.  
**[0:23:53-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:23:53):**  And so I came home from Neil to integrate high air stock density grazing on cropland.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:24:02):**  Now today, one of my business partners is Dr. Alan Williams and Dr. Williams is world  
**[0:24:08-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:24:08):**  renowned for his work on grazing and he prefers to call it AMPGrazing, Adaptive Multipadock  
**[0:24:17-0:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:24:17):**  Grazing because you need to be adaptive.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:24:21):**  You need to observe every day what the animals, what the forages tell you, how much forage  
**[0:24:28-0:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:24:28):**  do you have, and then you need to adjust accordingly.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:24:33):**  And that's the practice that we're using on our ranch today.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:24:37):**  We vary season of use grazing, we vary stock densities, we vary species of livestock that  
**[0:24:44-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:24:44):**  are grazed and all of those things go to mimic a natural ecosystem.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:24:50):**  That's remarkable and tell me a little bit about the natural ecosystem that you're looking  
**[0:24:54-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:24:54):**  to transition towards and how that fits into the history of land use in your area.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:25:00):**  So every location has its historical context.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:25:07):**  What was in that area historically?  
**[0:25:10-0:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:25:10):**  Well that's probably where you should start.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:25:14):**  So for instance earlier I said we're a cool season dominant area.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:25:20):**  So the species that are in our quote unquote native pastures now realize what's native,  
**[0:25:28-0:25:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:25:28):**  who really knows because it's ever evolving, but we're primarily cool season dominant.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:25:35):**  75 to 80% approximately of the forage species, grasses, forbs and legumes would be cool season  
**[0:25:42-0:25:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:25:42):**  dominant in my area.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:25:44):**  The other 25 to 30% would be warm season.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:25:47):**  So what adaptive grazing allows, it allows for the natural expression of that.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:25:56):**  The seeds are going to germinate that's in the latent seed bank, the species are going  
**[0:26:00-0:26:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:26:00):**  to thrive that fit that environment and that management.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:26:06):**  I believe that it's not up for me to decide what should be there.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:26:11):**  Too many people try and impose their will on nature and say oh I don't like that, I  
**[0:26:17-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:26:17):**  know I'm going to go spray that forb which is what weeds are, they're really forbs for  
**[0:26:23-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:26:23):**  the most part.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:26:25):**  Whereas why not let them express themselves, use the livestock as a tool to harvest that  
**[0:26:33-0:26:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:26:33):**  forage and convert it into dollars.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:26:36):**  And that's more or less what I look as my mission on being is I'm going to let nature  
**[0:26:43-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:26:43):**  express itself and then work with her accordingly.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:26:47):**  It's remarkable that this hasn't become more prolific much earlier.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:26:51):**  It seems to me that closing all of these loops of energy on your land and using them to fill  
**[0:26:57-0:27:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:26:57):**  out a large variety of enterprises can not only make for a more resilient business but

**[0:27:39-0:27:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:27:39):**  these ecological principles.

**[0:28:08-0:28:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:28:08):**  a method of farming and ranching that is centuries old.

**[0:38:57-0:39:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:38:57):**  So in the United States, under the current farm program, they have a program which allows  
**[0:39:08-0:39:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:39:08):**  farmers to purchase crop insurance.  
**[0:39:11-0:39:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:39:11):**  Now a part of that is what's called revenue insurance.  
**[0:39:15-0:39:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:39:15):**  So you take your historical proven yield for a commodity, let's just use maize or corn  
**[0:39:21-0:39:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:39:21):**  for an example, and you have your proven yield, well, you're able to buy up insurance on that  
**[0:39:30-0:39:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:39:30):**  crop up to 90% of your proven historical yield.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:39:37):**  Now the premiums are a little different.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:39:39):**  The higher insurance rate you buy, the higher the premium.  
**[0:39:42-0:39:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:39:42):**  However, the government subsidizes approximately two-thirds of the cost of that insurance.  
**[0:39:49-0:39:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:39:49):**  So you're only paying one-third.  
**[0:39:51-0:40:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:39:51):**  Well, what happens then is that based on that revenue insurance, how much money can I lock  
**[0:40:00-0:40:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:40:00):**  in?

**[0:40:02-0:40:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:40:02):**  I know if I keep my expenses below that amount, I'm going to make X amount of dollars.  
**[0:40:07-0:40:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:40:07):**  Well, that limits them for diversity.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:40:10):**  It limits their marketing.

**[0:40:17-0:40:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:40:17):**  the same species over and over year after year.

**[0:40:38-0:40:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:40:38):**  Yeah, that puts you in a big situation of advantage over others who are dependent on  
**[0:40:42-0:40:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:40:42):**  that system.

**[0:40:48-0:40:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:40:48):**  keep running over a certain amount and you're entirely dependent on the insurance for paying

**[0:41:01-0:41:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:41:01):**  drought and weather patterns and climate change in general.

**[0:41:07-0:41:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:41:07):**  Because in the United States, the vast majority of farmers and ranchers need to take out annual  
**[0:41:14-0:41:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:41:14):**  operating loans.

**[0:45:52-0:45:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:45:52):**  five years.  
**[0:45:54-0:45:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:45:54):**  You're going to follow these six principles for five years on that field.  
**[0:45:58-0:46:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:45:58):**  Ninety five plus times out of one hundred, what happens is by year three, they're totally

**[0:46:12-0:46:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:46:12):**  We're able to increase profitability the very first year.  
**[0:46:16-0:46:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:46:16):**  There's often this notion out there.  
**[0:46:18-0:46:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:46:18):**  Well, I'm going to go down the regenerative path, but I got to lose money a few years  
**[0:46:22-0:46:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:46:22):**  in order to increasing profit.

**[0:46:28-0:46:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:46:28):**  I said profit.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:46:30):**  There's a huge difference between profit and yield.  
**[0:46:32-0:46:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:46:32):**  I will take profit over yield any day.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:46:36):**  And so we start people according to their context and their comfort and then move them

**[0:46:49-0:46:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:46:49):**  jump all in.

**[0:46:55-0:47:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:46:55):**  the steps that they want to from financial to any other obligations that they're working  
**[0:47:00-0:47:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:47:00):**  with or even just the idea of what other people around them will think and their own habits  
**[0:47:04-0:47:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:47:04):**  that they've built up into that point and giving a roadmap of how to ease into it.  
**[0:47:09-0:47:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:47:09):**  And I love what you said, you know, maybe commit to a five year plan.  
**[0:47:12-0:47:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:47:12):**  And many times they find in a much shorter period of time that this is extremely effective  
**[0:47:17-0:47:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:47:17):**  and they'll go with it all in.  
**[0:47:19-0:47:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:47:19):**  With that being said, what advice would you give to new farmers, perhaps who don't even  
**[0:47:24-0:47:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:47:24):**  have experience in farming yet as to the urgency that this sector needs to bring in new ideas  
**[0:47:31-0:47:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:47:31):**  and new faces to really help this become a larger movement and to get it implemented  
**[0:47:36-0:47:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:47:36):**  around more places in the country?

**[0:48:12-0:48:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:48:12):**  and read a book.  
**[0:48:13-0:48:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:48:13):**  Well, you don't have to do that.

**[0:48:25-0:48:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:48:25):**  a garden.

**[0:48:38-0:48:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:48:38):**  out to that farm and ranch, see how they're producing, growing the vegetables, see how  
**[0:48:46-0:48:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/gabe-brown-on-how-to-restore-soil-and-ecological-health-on-a-massive-scale/#t=0:48:46):**  they're raising the chickens or the eggs that you're going to purchase from them.

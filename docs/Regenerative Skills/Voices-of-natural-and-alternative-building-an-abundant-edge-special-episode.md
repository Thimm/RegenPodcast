**[0:00:00-0:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:00:13):**  Here we dive deep into the diverse worlds of regenerative living, permaculture, and  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:00:17):**  natural building as we aspire to help you reach your highest potential for yourself,  
**[0:00:22-0:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:00:22):**  for your community, and for this beautiful planet that we share.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:00:25):**  As always, I'm your host Oliver Gaucher, and I'm thrilled to guide you through this  
**[0:00:29-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:00:29):**  next episode, so let's jump right in.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:00:59):**  Alright, welcome everyone to a special episode of the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:01:20):**  Now, I haven't done a special episode in a long time, in fact I haven't done any  
**[0:01:24-0:01:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:01:24):**  at all this season, and it's been a while since I've done a regenerative roundtable  
**[0:01:28-0:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:01:28):**  as well since I've been transitioning from the farm where I lived with my colleagues  
**[0:01:31-0:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:01:31):**  in Guatemala until May of this year to where I am now, which is a small town about half  
**[0:01:37-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:01:37):**  an hour north of Barcelona in the beautiful Mediterranean region of Catalunya in Spain.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:01:42):**  Now, in the last few months I backpacked up through southern Mexico, I spent a month visiting  
**[0:01:48-0:01:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:01:48):**  family in Spokane, Washington, and then another month visiting my brothers and nephew in Minnesota  
**[0:01:53-0:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:01:53):**  where I mostly grew up.  
**[0:01:55-0:01:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:01:55):**  And I've been in Spain now just under two months, and I'm working with my partner  
**[0:01:59-0:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:01:59):**  here to start a whole bunch of new exciting projects both online and in the community,  
**[0:02:04-0:02:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:02:04):**  which I'll be sure to talk about in future episodes once things start to get off the  
**[0:02:08-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:02:08):**  ground.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:02:09):**  So, today I'm going to be giving a review of the previous series on natural building  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:02:14):**  and regenerative living and design from the last handful of weeks for those of you who  
**[0:02:19-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:02:19):**  want just a cliff nose, and the most important information from about a month and a half  
**[0:02:24-0:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:02:24):**  of episodes, almost two months now.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:02:27):**  I'll be talking about some of the main takeaways and the things that I learned from these interviews,  
**[0:02:31-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:02:31):**  as well as presenting some new questions to you out there listening, while sharing some  
**[0:02:35-0:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:02:35):**  thoughts and stories from some of my own experience as a builder and a traveler, and some things  
**[0:02:40-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:02:40):**  that have taught me a lot over the last decade.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:02:43):**  So let's jump right in.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:02:44):**  So I started this series on building with an interview with Chris Magwood, the founder  
**[0:02:55-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:02:55):**  of the Endeavor Center in Ontario, Canada, and the author of many books that I've found  
**[0:03:00-0:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:03:00):**  to be essential resources for natural building, including Making Better Buildings, Essential  
**[0:03:05-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:03:05):**  Prefab Strawbell Construction, Essential Hemp Creek Construction, Essential Sustainable  
**[0:03:10-0:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:03:10):**  Home Design, and he's also collaborated on many others.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:03:14):**  This interview gave me a really good overview of a lot of different natural building materials,  
**[0:03:19-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:03:19):**  as well as how they compare to each other, their advantages and disadvantages, and the  
**[0:03:23-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:03:23):**  context and climates where they excel or are the wrong choice.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:03:28):**  I chose this as the first episode not only for the broad overview and understanding that  
**[0:03:32-0:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:03:32):**  Chris brings, but also because his story is one that a lot of people interested in natural  
**[0:03:37-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:03:37):**  building I think can relate to.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:03:40):**  This started out like many of us just wanting to build his own home, he wanted to do something  
**[0:03:44-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:03:44):**  of high quality that wasn't too hard to learn to build and that didn't cause any unnecessary  
**[0:03:49-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:03:49):**  destruction to the planet in the process, and he found that there were few resources  
**[0:03:54-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:03:54):**  at the time for owner builders like him, and so he set out to compile the resources and  
**[0:03:59-0:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:03:59):**  knowledge that would make it easier for others to build sustainably in the future.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:04:04):**  I was really looking forward to getting his take on some of the most important considerations  
**[0:04:07-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:04:07):**  when designing a building, because I know from experience that this is where a lot of  
**[0:04:12-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:04:12):**  future problems and expensive mistakes can be avoided if the design and planning are  
**[0:04:17-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:04:17):**  done correctly.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:04:19):**  Chris is also a great resource for ideas on how to work within tight code and building  
**[0:04:24-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:04:24):**  restrictions, and he's worked directly with government bodies in Canada and the US to  
**[0:04:29-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:04:29):**  get many natural structures approved and permitted.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:04:33):**  Well I think one thing that I've learned is to not see those codes necessarily as restrictions.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:04:40):**  At the core, all codes are public safety documents, and I learned a long time ago from a colleague  
**[0:04:49-0:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:04:49):**  David Eisenberg that really we want the exact same things from a building that a code official  
**[0:04:58-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:04:58):**  does.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:05:00):**  We want to ensure that this building is safe for all the occupants.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:05:04):**  We want to make sure that it's safe for a long time.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:05:08):**  We want to make sure that it can withstand whatever climatic conditions or ground conditions  
**[0:05:15-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:05:15):**  exist.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:05:16):**  So we share all of those goals, and in fact we have a whole bunch of other public health  
**[0:05:23-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:05:23):**  and safety goals that are complementary to that.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:05:27):**  We want to not just make the building safe structurally, we want to make sure that it's  
**[0:05:32-0:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:05:32):**  safe in terms of indoor environment quality.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:05:35):**  We want to make sure it's not wrecking the whole rest of the planet in order to make  
**[0:05:41-0:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:05:41):**  a safe haven for an occupant.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:05:43):**  So we're not really at odds with the intent of the codes at all.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:05:52):**  I think even just approaching code officials in that way where it's like instead of going  
**[0:05:58-0:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:05:58):**  in bristling and ready for a fight, we go in saying, hey, we want the same things you  
**[0:06:08-0:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:06:08):**  want, and this is how we're interpreting your notion of safety.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:06:14):**  If you look at it, we're actually trying to do more of what you're trying to do than less  
**[0:06:20-0:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:06:20):**  of what you're trying to do.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:06:24):**  Lots of the codes in their preambles talk about the fact that they're not meant to restrict  
**[0:06:32-0:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:06:32):**  or limit people and what they want to do, but to just ensure that those things are done  
**[0:06:39-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:06:39):**  safely.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:06:40):**  So I think coming at it from that point of view is really helpful.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:06:44):**  We've gotten really good.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:06:46):**  Here in Ontario, there's a system for what's called alternative compliance.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:06:52):**  So we've gotten really good at writing alternative compliance packages where we find all the  
**[0:06:59-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:06:59):**  areas of the code where a building official might have questions about what we're doing,  
**[0:07:04-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:07:04):**  find relevant test results from Canada and around the world that show that what we're  
**[0:07:10-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:07:10):**  doing meets the minimum intent of the code and in fact sort of surpasses it in most cases.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:07:19):**  But I think that the thing that we found, it's not really limiting, but the difficulty  
**[0:07:25-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:07:25):**  in working with alternatives and codes is just you have to expect to take more time  
**[0:07:32-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:07:32):**  to prepare those documents.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:07:35):**  You have to expect to take more time to have the conversations at the building department  
**[0:07:39-0:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:07:39):**  to get the permit and you may be sort of taking on some additional costs if you need a structural  
**[0:07:46-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:07:46):**  engineer involved or an architect involved or a code consultant involved.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:07:50):**  So we've never not been able to do something that we've proposed to do and we've done some  
**[0:07:57-0:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:07:57):**  things that I think people would think are pretty out there and alternative, but everything  
**[0:08:01-0:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:08:01):**  we've done has received approval from a building department here, but it hasn't always been  
**[0:08:09-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:08:09):**  the straightest, easiest path to make that happen.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:08:13):**  Sometimes we have to work at it.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:08:15):**  Now I myself have mostly built in places with very lax or non-existent building regulations  
**[0:08:22-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:08:22):**  and now that I've moved to Europe, I know that I'll have to deal with tighter oversight  
**[0:08:26-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:08:26):**  of building projects and so getting these ideas and advice was one of the biggest takeaways  
**[0:08:31-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:08:31):**  that I got from this interview.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:08:33):**  Now I know that many of you listening live in the US, Canada, Australia, England or New  
**[0:08:37-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:08:37):**  Zealand since that's where my biggest listener bases are, and we'll also have to deal with  
**[0:08:43-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:08:43):**  regulations there too.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:08:45):**  But even for those of you who plan to move and start building in places without tight  
**[0:08:50-0:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:08:50):**  regulations, I think it's still important to look to certain building regulations to  
**[0:08:56-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:08:56):**  get an idea of the best practices and safety measures that are recommended, especially  
**[0:09:01-0:09:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:09:01):**  for first time builder designers.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:09:04):**  A lot of the codes were written to prevent engineering mistakes, fire hazards or damage  
**[0:09:08-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:09:08):**  from natural disasters, and as someone who has worked in both conventional construction  
**[0:09:13-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:09:13):**  and as a natural builder and designer, I promise you that most regulations and safety measures  
**[0:09:18-0:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:09:18):**  apply just as much to natural buildings as to industrial ones.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:09:22):**  The materials might be different, but you still want to make sure that your buildings  
**[0:09:26-0:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:09:26):**  are as well made, safe and healthy as possible, not only for the safety of the inhabitants  
**[0:09:32-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:09:32):**  and the longevity of the building, but in my experience, doing everything with natural  
**[0:09:36-0:09:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:09:36):**  materials and not relying on the process or the industrial process of getting materials  
**[0:09:42-0:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:09:42):**  that are kind of pre-made for you means you're going to be doing a ton of physical labor  
**[0:09:46-0:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:09:46):**  either by yourself or in small groups or in workshops or whatever it might be, and you  
**[0:09:51-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:09:51):**  don't want to have to repeat that process because you overlooked some part of the design  
**[0:09:56-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:09:56):**  or engineering portion.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:09:57):**  I would say right off the bat size, everybody tends to want to make the biggest building  
**[0:10:04-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:10:04):**  that they possibly can for the amount of money that they think they have, and I've yet to  
**[0:10:12-0:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:10:12):**  see the building project where everything goes according to plan and according to budget,  
**[0:10:17-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:10:17):**  and so people want to kind of start with their budget maxed out right from the design, building  
**[0:10:25-0:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:10:25):**  as much building as they possibly can for the amount of money they have and then running  
**[0:10:30-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:10:30):**  out partway through.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:10:35):**  Keeping a sort of grip on size I think is really important, and then from there, really  
**[0:10:41-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:10:41):**  obvious things like passive solar design, which I think in our climate up here in Ontario,  
**[0:10:50-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:10:50):**  passive solar often gets sort of viewed through the lens of trying to maximize winter solar  
**[0:10:57-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:10:57):**  gain in the building, sometimes at the expense of summer shading, which is especially with  
**[0:11:05-0:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:11:05):**  climate change becoming more and more important in a lot of ways because we have a cloudier  
**[0:11:14-0:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:11:14):**  winter climate here where you often don't have very much direct summer sunshine or winter  
**[0:11:19-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:11:19):**  sunshine to benefit from, but you sure get a lot of summer sun.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:11:24):**  Thinking about passive solar from the shading point of view I think is really important  
**[0:11:30-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:11:30):**  and often gets overlooked.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:11:33):**  So many areas now are using a ton more energy in the cooling process in the summertime than  
**[0:11:39-0:11:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:11:39):**  they do in the heating in the winter, partly because you can heat a home with wood or other  
**[0:11:45-0:11:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:11:45):**  local resources fairly easily in a lot of places, whereas you can't burn wood to cool  
**[0:11:51-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:11:51):**  a house obviously, and the infrastructure, especially in cities where you're having that  
**[0:11:57-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:11:57):**  sort of heat island effect for having paved over so many surfaces, not having much green  
**[0:12:01-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:12:01):**  space is exacerbating the problem hugely.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:12:05):**  What are some of the things that you recommend for passive cooling techniques in a design?  
**[0:12:12-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:12:12):**  Well mostly on the south face of the building making sure that whatever overhangs you have  
**[0:12:20-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:12:20):**  for your building, roof overhangs will provide adequate shading through the summer.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:12:26):**  So that's sort of the easy low hanging fruit part of things.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:12:31):**  And this especially tends to get ignored on houses that are more than one story.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:12:36):**  So if you have an appropriate say 24 inch roof overhang on a two story building that  
**[0:12:42-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:12:42):**  will do a great job of shading the second story windows, but the main story windows  
**[0:12:46-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:12:46):**  are still going to be exposed.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:12:48):**  So making sure that all of those southern windows have summer shading and then really  
**[0:12:56-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:12:56):**  paying attention to the west side of buildings because it's pretty easy to design an appropriate  
**[0:13:02-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:13:02):**  overhang on the south side of a building, but on the west as the sun is sort of lower  
**[0:13:07-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:13:07):**  in the sky, a typical roof overhang is not going to shade those windows.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:13:12):**  And because it's later in the day and the temperatures are already high and the air  
**[0:13:17-0:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:13:17):**  temperature has gone up, having that west sun sort of beating into your windows is a  
**[0:13:23-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:13:23):**  huge cause of overheating.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:13:25):**  So thinking about ways to either just minimize western windows, to use porches on that side  
**[0:13:31-0:13:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:13:31):**  of the building or other kinds of coverings on the windows, whether that's vines or blinds  
**[0:13:40-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:13:40):**  or coatings directly on the glass, but really trying to be conscious that what western windows  
**[0:13:48-0:14:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:13:48):**  you have are definitely going to be a pretty major source of overheating.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:14:01):**  Now the second interview in this series was with my friend Trey Abernethy from Natural  
**[0:14:06-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:14:06):**  Building Costa Rica, who is based at a gorgeous permaculture site in Costa Rica called Punta  
**[0:14:11-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:14:11):**  Mona and who has worked in the building trades in the states for a long time, but a few years  
**[0:14:16-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:14:16):**  ago transitioned to working primarily with bamboo after taking a building course with  
**[0:14:20-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:14:20):**  his mentor and co-teacher, Rodolfo Sainz.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:14:24):**  Now though I've had other great conversations about bamboo building with my own friend and  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:14:28):**  mentor Charlie Rendell in previous seasons, this interview was especially useful as a  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:14:33):**  full overview of the whole process of bamboo from growing and harvesting the poles through  
**[0:14:38-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:14:38):**  treatment methods, joinery techniques, maintenance considerations and design considerations.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:14:44):**  I can tell that Trey really knows his stuff and one of the biggest takeaways for me was  
**[0:14:48-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:14:48):**  hearing about some of the materials and ways that Trey had found to preserve and extend  
**[0:14:53-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:14:53):**  the life of his bamboo and his bamboo buildings in turn.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:14:58):**  You know when it's treated properly and it's dried and cured properly, it really can and  
**[0:15:03-0:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:15:03):**  is a lifetime building product and in Colombia man they have houses that are 150 or more  
**[0:15:10-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:15:10):**  years old that are multi-generational bamboo houses.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:15:13):**  That's remarkable.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:15:15):**  Some of the traditional methods of curing bamboo in Colombia is they actually do not  
**[0:15:24-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:15:24):**  use borax or boric acid or anything.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:15:27):**  What they do is they actually cut the bamboo in the field, leave it just leaning up into  
**[0:15:35-0:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:15:35):**  the existing bamboo clump and set the base on a piece of rock or a piece of wood and  
**[0:15:39-0:15:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:15:39):**  leave it for four to six weeks.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:15:42):**  What happens is it dries and cures and has a vinegarization process where it naturally  
**[0:15:49-0:15:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:15:49):**  dries out the sugars and whatnot.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:15:51):**  I don't know the whole science behind it but I do know that it does work.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:15:57):**  I have had a friend here in Costa Rica that has done that process with the bamboo he's  
**[0:16:03-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:16:03):**  used to build his structures and most of the structures on his farm are about 12 years  
**[0:16:07-0:16:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:16:07):**  old.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:16:08):**  There's no signs of insects or fungal issues.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:16:12):**  He just lets it dry naturally in the clump with the branches and the leaf still on it.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:16:19):**  I think what it is is photosynthesis is still happening for a little while after you cut  
**[0:16:25-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:16:25):**  it and so it's utilizing up a lot of the sugars and starches that are in the bamboo before  
**[0:16:30-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:16:30):**  it fully dies.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:16:33):**  That's kind of my theory on it.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:16:34):**  If that's been shown to work so effectively in the past, how come there's not more use  
**[0:16:41-0:16:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:16:41):**  of those methods in the more industrial or construction industries for bamboo?  
**[0:16:47-0:16:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:16:47):**  Yeah, that's a good question.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:16:51):**  There are a lot of industrial treatment processes that use a lot of harmful chemicals in Asia  
**[0:16:58-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:16:58):**  and in South America where they use all kinds of different things, sodium pentanate, copper  
**[0:17:07-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:17:07):**  sulfate is one that's utilized a lot that is a harmful byproduct to put out into the  
**[0:17:16-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:17:16):**  environment.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:17:17):**  I don't even know what they do with the spent solution and stuff but probably not getting  
**[0:17:22-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:17:22):**  into waterways and things.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:17:25):**  That's why I really like borax and boric acid.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:17:29):**  It's a proven effective treatment solution.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:17:32):**  They've been, I think it was pioneered originally in Bali maybe in the 70s and they've been  
**[0:17:41-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:17:41):**  doing it there for decades and that's what they do with the green school which is a huge  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:17:51):**  bamboo school that they built in Bali and then they have a whole green village community  
**[0:17:56-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:17:56):**  that they've built around it.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:17:59):**  There's some five story incredible houses there and they're treating with boric and  
**[0:18:05-0:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:18:05):**  boric acid and it's a proven treatment solution that is effective and works.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:18:10):**  It's pretty cheap.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:18:12):**  You can buy a 50 kilo sack of it fairly cheap and if it's done properly either by a dunk  
**[0:18:22-0:18:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:18:22):**  tank solution or a bootry system it can really be a lifetime building product and a sustainable  
**[0:18:30-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:18:30):**  regenerative solution to cutting down hardwood trees to build with and utilizing a lot of  
**[0:18:38-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:18:38):**  these other materials that have a high carbon footprint and a negative impact.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:18:44):**  I honestly wish I had taken the time to ask him a bit more about his joinery techniques  
**[0:18:49-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:18:49):**  that didn't use hole saws and metal connections which is the way that I'm most familiar with  
**[0:18:53-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:18:53):**  and have used the most from when I was in Guatemala.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:18:57):**  But from what I understand those methods and materials change a lot based on where they  
**[0:19:00-0:19:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:19:00):**  originate and where they're practiced.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:19:03):**  Bamboo is such a fascinating material to me and there are so many different varieties  
**[0:19:07-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:19:07):**  as well.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:19:08):**  These days I'm looking as much into the edible and ornamental garden types more than the  
**[0:19:13-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:19:13):**  construction grade varietal because those types don't grow much in Spain and I don't  
**[0:19:17-0:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:19:17):**  see any need to try and import them.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:19:20):**  So if any of you listening know much about edible bamboo shoots not just for panda bears  
**[0:19:24-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:19:24):**  but for people be sure to let me know reach out if you get the chance.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:19:28):**  I'll also put links to other interviews on bamboo that I've done in the show notes for  
**[0:19:32-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:19:32):**  this episode for those of you who are looking for different perspectives from different  
**[0:19:36-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:19:36):**  people and experiences on this material.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:19:46):**  From there the third interview in this series was a follow up with a good friend of mine  
**[0:19:49-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:19:49):**  from back in the US, Kirk Donkey Mobert.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:19:53):**  Now Donkey has always been my go to guy for all things pyro.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:19:57):**  When it comes to fire, especially rocket stoves, heaters and cooking systems, I usually go  
**[0:20:01-0:20:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:20:01):**  to check out the forums that he hosts on these topics with a whole bunch of other fire nerds  
**[0:20:06-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:20:06):**  like me who weigh in on designs and projects to test out all kinds of ways to save fuel  
**[0:20:12-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:20:12):**  and get cleaner burns and maximize heat efficiency with their experiments.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:20:17):**  In that interview we caught up on a lot of the newer developments in rocket stove technology  
**[0:20:22-0:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:20:22):**  and configurations which I'm only just starting to become familiar with.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:20:27):**  We talked about bell rockets, batch box configurations, but most importantly the materials that you  
**[0:20:33-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:20:33):**  can find or salvage in order to start experimenting and building with stoves for yourself.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:20:39):**  Donkey is a master at turning salvaged materials and mud into magic.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:20:43):**  One of my favorite parts from the conversation was when he took the time to describe some  
**[0:20:47-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:20:47):**  of the nifty add-ons that have been developed by the community to improve efficiency and  
**[0:20:51-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:20:51):**  functionality of the batch box burners.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:20:54):**  There's a little thing called a peter channel, a p channel.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:20:58):**  It's a metal plate that you can build that goes against the front brick or the back brick  
**[0:21:04-0:21:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:21:04):**  I guess, the brick away from you.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:21:06):**  Agreed.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:21:07):**  Yeah, those can be super useful and there's like that variation on the L configuration  
**[0:21:11-0:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:21:11):**  too that keeps the airflow underneath going as well.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:21:14):**  Yep, that's right.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:21:15):**  Yep, those are super useful.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:21:17):**  I would recommend if anybody's building those configurations to make the little extra effort  
**[0:21:21-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:21:21):**  and put that metal thing in there.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:21:23):**  Yeah, well that, I mean the metal thing avoids, it's great for three things really.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:21:28):**  I'm not saying a joke.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:21:29):**  Yeah, did we talk about this in the last go?  
**[0:21:31-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:21:31):**  I don't think we covered the p channel.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:21:33):**  Okay, yeah, I don't really remember that we did.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:21:35):**  It's worth mentioning though.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:21:37):**  Yeah, well it's just a little metal plate and it's about 5% of the cross-sectional area  
**[0:21:46-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:21:46):**  of the whole system and what it does is it creates, well actually no, let me rephrase  
**[0:21:51-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:21:51):**  that.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:21:52):**  It's the air channel that's 5% of the cross-sectional area of the rest of the system.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:21:58):**  And fresh air that then can be sort of injected in front downstream from where the wood is.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:22:06):**  And it keeps that first brick much cooler so it's less likely to crack and it sort of  
**[0:22:13-0:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:22:13):**  prevents what you were talking about, wood from falling into that space and just completely  
**[0:22:19-0:22:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:22:19):**  choking the fire.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:22:22):**  And it also creates a consistent steady stream of cool air and just downstream where you  
**[0:22:30-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:22:30):**  want it really.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:22:33):**  So it's really good for organizing the fire.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:22:36):**  And it goes hand in hand with another thing called a trip wire.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:22:41):**  Now this one I have been reading about, I've seen all the pictures and the instructions  
**[0:22:45-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:22:45):**  on the forums that you host, but I haven't had a chance to try it out myself.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:22:49):**  Can you explain it a little?  
**[0:22:51-0:22:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:22:51):**  Yeah, you may have experienced this with regular J-tube, you know where you put the wood in  
**[0:22:56-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:22:56):**  and it'll do something that I call seeking where the flame will run down the firebox  
**[0:23:02-0:23:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:23:02):**  really far and you'll even see it sometimes pop out of the heat riser for a second and  
**[0:23:09-0:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:23:09):**  then it'll run back again and then it'll run out and run back.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:23:13):**  It'll sort of pulse.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:23:16):**  You may have seen that pulsing and every time the fire does that pulsing maneuver, when  
**[0:23:23-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:23:23):**  it returns it'll puff a little puff of smoke.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:23:27):**  So if you were to check its efficiency curve while it's pulsing, you'll see high efficiency  
**[0:23:32-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:23:32):**  and then suddenly this low efficiency moment and then back to high efficiency again and  
**[0:23:37-0:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:23:37):**  back to low efficiency, etc.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:23:40):**  And it's a sign that there's an airflow problem, but even when the air is going fine and everything's  
**[0:23:49-0:23:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:23:49):**  arranged just right, you can still see that flame sort of pulse in and out.  
**[0:23:54-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:23:54):**  And quite often you'll see that flame running up the heat riser and it'll be a little more  
**[0:24:00-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:24:00):**  disorganized.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:24:02):**  So what a tripwire does is it's, it can be made a lot of different ways, but typically  
**[0:24:08-0:24:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:24:08):**  it's a brick with sort of an arrow shape cut into it and the arrow shape has what we call  
**[0:24:15-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:24:15):**  a bluff body on it.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:24:18):**  And this brick is placed at the very top of the horizontal burn chamber.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:24:22):**  So it's down.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:24:25):**  And this is closer towards the fuel source or closer towards the heat riser?  
**[0:24:29-0:24:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:24:29):**  It's kind of in the middle.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:24:31):**  I would say, you know, most of my horizontal, most of my burn tunnels are about four bricks  
**[0:24:39-0:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:24:39):**  deep.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:24:40):**  Okay.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:24:41):**  Okay.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:24:42):**  So I guess it's actually closer to the fuel source because it's the second brick typically.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:24:46):**  Gotcha.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:24:47):**  Gotcha.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:24:48):**  And so visually looking at it, it's, it's like a slanted arrow pointing downstream of  
**[0:24:53-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:24:53):**  where the fire is going, right?  
**[0:24:54-0:24:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:24:54):**  Right.  
**[0:24:55-0:24:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:24:55):**  That's right.  
**[0:24:56-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:24:56):**  And it's a slanted arrow.  
**[0:24:57-0:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:24:57):**  So it makes a little bluff.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:24:58):**  It's like a little projection from the ceiling.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:25:00):**  Yep.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:25:01):**  Um, and that little projection creates turbulence.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:25:06):**  And so what that turbulence does is it mixes the fuel air better because you know, the  
**[0:25:11-0:25:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:25:11):**  unburned fuel, the hot unburned fuel tends to rise to the top of that, of that tunnel.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:25:18):**  And so this little heat, this little trip wire will spin that stuff up really well.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:25:25):**  So you'll get a really good fuel air mixture there.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:25:29):**  But what it also does is it creates sort of a flame holder.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:25:32):**  Um, are you familiar with the term flame holder?  
**[0:25:35-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:25:35):**  No, no.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:25:36):**  Catch me up to speed.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:25:37):**  Well, a lot of stoves like propane stoves, any stove that burns a gas, right?  
**[0:25:42-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:25:42):**  Um, they'll have something called a flame holder in it.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:25:45):**  And quite often it's just the, the aperture.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:25:48):**  It's just the holes in your, in your stove top.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:25:51):**  Um, they create a turbulence and that turbulence is consistent.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:25:54):**  It stays in one spot so that when the gas comes up and mixes with air, the flame is  
**[0:25:59-0:26:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:25:59):**  always in one spot.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:26:04):**  Otherwise the flame will, yeah, it'll, it'll be a regular, it'll seek around and they can  
**[0:26:08-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:26:08):**  put itself out like in a propane stove.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:26:11):**  Sure.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:26:12):**  Um, so this creates a flame holder inside the rocket stove itself in the burn tunnel  
**[0:26:18-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:26:18):**  so that then the flame stopped seeking.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:26:21):**  It's always in a consistent spot.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:26:23):**  Um, and it has more time to burn itself completely and run the fire out.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:26:28):**  And quite often you won't even see flames in the heat riser at all.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:26:33):**  The fuel will be completely burned, um, before it even gets to the riser.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:26:38):**  Gotcha.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:26:39):**  And so is this, are any of these techniques something that can be integrated in with the  
**[0:26:44-0:26:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:26:44):**  batch box?  
**[0:26:46-0:26:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:26:46):**  Because all the configurations that I've seen are even simpler than what we've described  
**[0:26:50-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:26:50):**  here.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:26:51):**  You're trying to break it down from the beginning for the batch box?  
**[0:26:54-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:26:54):**  Batch boxes have all of those features in them.  
**[0:26:56-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:26:56):**  They just look a little different.  
**[0:26:58-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:26:58):**  Okay.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:26:59):**  So what a batch box is, is, is, is as I said before, it's a much larger feed box so you  
**[0:27:07-0:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:27:07):**  could stick in a whole batch of wood.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:27:08):**  It's like a, like a regular wood stove kind of.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:27:11):**  You put a front door on it, you open the door, you start your fire, you put the wood in,  
**[0:27:16-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:27:16):**  you close the door and it burns about four times as much at one given moment as, um,  
**[0:27:23-0:27:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:27:23):**  as a JT will.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:27:25):**  I also really liked his advice on how people at home can get started tinkering and experimenting.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:27:30):**  You know, find a safe place out in your yard or, or in a barn with good ventilation and  
**[0:27:36-0:27:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:27:36):**  get started.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:27:37):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:27:38):**  Just get out there and do it, man.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:27:39):**  There's no impediment to just doing it.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:27:42):**  And from my own experience, like worst case scenario, it's a lot of fun playing with fire.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:27:47):**  I mean, maybe that's the worst case scenario, but assuming you're being safe, it's just  
**[0:27:50-0:27:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:27:50):**  a lot of fun to play around with how to manipulate these, uh, really base kind of physics, um,  
**[0:27:58-0:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:27:58):**  of how heat thermodynamics and stuff work with really minimal materials.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:28:04):**  Like this is something you could just, uh, I think in our courses we were throwing these  
**[0:28:08-0:28:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:28:08):**  up with a bit of mud and some clay bricks and cheap clay bricks in probably a matter  
**[0:28:12-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:28:12):**  of 20 minutes.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:28:13):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:28:14):**  Oh, I mean, yeah, that's about right.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:28:16):**  I mean, really what we have at a rocket stove is it's a Fox stove above ground.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:28:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:28:23):**  Right.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:28:24):**  So go back to the history of it.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:28:26):**  Look at Fox stoves, build one, look at, um, you know, uh, look at the old tin cans stove,  
**[0:28:33-0:28:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:28:33):**  build a couple, you know, as a test, you can just use metal stovepipe and cobble.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:28:38):**  Fabric, cobble, some garbage together and get a cool stove that will not last, but it's  
**[0:28:44-0:28:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:28:44):**  fun.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:28:45):**  Right.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:28:46):**  And you can, you can iterate changes really quickly with something like that.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:28:50):**  Exactly.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:28:51):**  That's where you get to really experiment around and try new stuff.  
**[0:28:55-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:28:55):**  Absolutely try new stuff.  
**[0:28:56-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:28:56):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:28:57):**  And, and of course go and look at the things that other people have done on the forums  
**[0:29:01-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:29:01):**  and all of that stuff, but don't be afraid to try things that other people think are  
**[0:29:05-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:29:05):**  dumb.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:29:06):**  Um, you know, like I can only screw up so many ways.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:29:10):**  I can only think of so many ways to screw up.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:29:13):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:29:14):**  And I've done my best learning by screwing up.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:29:18):**  So everybody find a way to screw up in a way that nobody else has figured out how to do  
**[0:29:27-0:29:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:29:27):**  because that's going to teach you something about building a better stove next time.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:29:31):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:29:32):**  Right.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:29:33):**  And of course make it safe for yourself, your family, your neighbors do your best to be  
**[0:29:38-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:29:38):**  safe, but don't be afraid of experimenting and doing, you know, quote unquote dumb things.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:29:45):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:29:46):**  You know, because that's how we all got started.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:29:47):**  We were told this wasn't possible.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:29:49):**  We were told we were doing stupid things.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:29:51):**  I want to have hippies over there.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:29:52):**  They're going to kill themselves.  
**[0:29:55-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:29:55):**  Well you know, not yet.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:29:57):**  And we did some great things.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:30:04):**  That's not really the best gotcha I've heard.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:30:06):**  We haven't said that yet, but I'm totally in this camp.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:30:12):**  So I'm in favor of it.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:30:13):**  Right.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:30:14):**  You know, the point being is that we've created something really cool that people said that  
**[0:30:19-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:30:19):**  couldn't be done.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:30:22):**  And we did it because we were willing to do dumb things.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:30:26):**  Rocky's attitude towards innovation as a collaborative effort and the work of passionate amateurs  
**[0:30:31-0:30:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:30:31):**  like us, for example, always leaves me feeling like I can contribute to the advancement of  
**[0:30:36-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:30:36):**  things like this, even without formal training.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:30:39):**  And I hope that's how a lot of you end up feeling as a result of this series in general.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:30:43):**  You can start small, but know that with time you can really make everything you need with  
**[0:30:47-0:30:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:30:47):**  the resources around you.  
**[0:30:49-0:31:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:30:49):**  After all, that's what all of our ancestors did for thousands of years.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:31:02):**  So after speaking with Donkey, I took a different direction and reached out to Mark Lakeman,  
**[0:31:07-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:31:07):**  a long time hero of design for me, who I'd spoken to along with Riddi D'Cruz in a previous  
**[0:31:12-0:31:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:31:12):**  interview on community design and public space.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:31:15):**  And this time around, we talked about the architecture of healthy communities and how  
**[0:31:19-0:31:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:31:19):**  the infrastructure that we live our lives in could be reimagined to facilitate community  
**[0:31:24-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:31:24):**  and intimacy.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:31:26):**  Mark has a lot of insights on these topics, and I've watched talks of his, including a  
**[0:31:30-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:31:30):**  great TED Talk, many times when wrestling with bigger design concepts.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:31:35):**  In that session we talked about the damaging effects of the colonial infrastructure and  
**[0:31:39-0:31:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:31:39):**  community design that so many of us in the West and in former colonized countries live  
**[0:31:44-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:31:44):**  in.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:31:45):**  But more than just pointing out the bad, Mark also offered a lot of insights from his years  
**[0:31:50-0:31:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:31:50):**  working at the community level with projects like City Repair in Portland, Oregon, and  
**[0:31:55-0:31:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:31:55):**  Dignity Village, a community for the homeless.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:31:58):**  I was in Denver, I was in Boulder a couple years ago, and working with homeless people  
**[0:32:04-0:32:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:32:04):**  there and doing some design charettes for houseless villages, tiny home villages.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:32:11):**  This is a project I've been working on since 1999, so 20 years into this, really working  
**[0:32:17-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:32:17):**  hard on replicating.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:32:20):**  You used the word dignity.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:32:22):**  Our first village was named Dignity Village, and it's still going strong and has been providing  
**[0:32:28-0:32:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:32:28):**  assistance to communities all over the country to be able to create similar prototypes.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:32:34):**  So it's very exciting.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:32:36):**  But when I was in Denver, I heard from a homeless person speaking at an event that Albert Einstein's  
**[0:32:46-0:32:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:32:46):**  granddaughter is a homeless person living in Denver.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:32:50):**  And you hear something like that, and it's like, okay, how much more convincing do people  
**[0:32:58-0:33:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:32:58):**  need to understand that this is really an economic issue, or it's very complex.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:33:07):**  It's very complex.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:33:09):**  I think it's too easy for people to continue to do this same stuff about marginalizing  
**[0:33:15-0:33:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:33:15):**  people based on their projections, that people are too lazy or they just don't want to work,  
**[0:33:20-0:33:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:33:20):**  or they have a mental health problem.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:33:23):**  In the case of Einstein's granddaughter, probably she's wandering around sitting there having  
**[0:33:28-0:33:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:33:28):**  epiphanies about the relationship of light and space, and she can't be bothered to get  
**[0:33:34-0:33:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:33:34):**  a job at 7-Eleven because she's too busy counting stars or something.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:33:38):**  Seriously, in my work over these last 20 years, I have met so many brilliant people who probably  
**[0:33:44-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:33:44):**  would not be living in the streets if they lived in a society that would embrace them  
**[0:33:48-0:33:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:33:48):**  for their qualities and their talents.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:33:51):**  I've also met people who won't suffer the indignity of trading their time for money  
**[0:33:59-0:34:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:33:59):**  because life is too interesting.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:34:01):**  So I've met people who are intensely artistic and they live outside.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:34:08):**  I'm just going to give you a bunch of different thoughts.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:34:10):**  I mean, Oregon Public Broadcasting, a national public radio series a couple years ago, on  
**[0:34:17-0:34:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:34:17):**  the surprising percentage of people who have nomadic ancestry that live out in the streets.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:34:25):**  When I heard this series, I was thinking about that story in the Bible, which is basically  
**[0:34:33-0:34:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:34:33):**  just this allegory about the conflict between the rise of the city-state and colonialism  
**[0:34:39-0:34:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:34:39):**  and its hostility toward all things local, all local cultures.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:34:44):**  So Cain, whose name basically means city-state, kills his brother, who's Abel, whose name  
**[0:34:51-0:34:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:34:51):**  basically means nomad.  
**[0:34:53-0:35:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:34:53):**  What we have is this hostility toward the ephemeral, toward alternative forms of culture.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:35:01):**  And colonialism basically needs everyone to be nailed down to ground to pay for their  
**[0:35:06-0:35:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:35:06):**  space to fund the society.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:35:09):**  And we basically outlawed an entire paradigm, a way of being.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:35:13):**  A lot of people out in the streets apparently have a proclivity for being nomadic.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:35:18):**  And we're telling them that they have nowhere, there's no ground for them to sleep in the  
**[0:35:22-0:35:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:35:22):**  world, simply because we've decided to outlaw the very phenomena of being nomadic.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:35:28):**  This is so profoundly unjust, so profoundly ignorant and criminal.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:35:33):**  And it's just one aspect of homelessness, just one dimension of the conversation.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:35:38):**  It's as complex as each individual.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:35:43):**  Truly, truly.  
**[0:35:46-0:35:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:35:46):**  Who knows why Einstein's grand-mother, grand-daughter would be homeless?  
**[0:35:50-0:35:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:35:50):**  Who knows what's happening in her life to make this happen?  
**[0:35:56-0:36:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:35:56):**  And you know, as I've been working on this and meeting people personally, it goes from  
**[0:36:00-0:36:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:36:00):**  being like a conceptual project where I'm doing it for different reasons, like, gosh,  
**[0:36:05-0:36:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:36:05):**  all of these houses villages are prototyped for carbon reduction, how exciting.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:36:10):**  For me as a design nerd, one of the biggest motivations is like, I get to just relish  
**[0:36:16-0:36:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:36:16):**  this experience of regenerating urban form over and over again, and witnessing the playing  
**[0:36:24-0:36:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:36:24):**  out of settlement patterns, which is one of the most...  
**[0:36:27-0:36:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:36:27):**  People think that when they think about design, they think about forms and objects and products  
**[0:36:31-0:36:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:36:31):**  and architecture.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:36:33):**  The ultimate design is to witness people collaborating together to create urban form, to create settlement  
**[0:36:41-0:36:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:36:41):**  patterns that evidence how they move in space and how they relate to each other, how they  
**[0:36:47-0:36:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:36:47):**  respond to climate and light, to wind and rain, and then alchemize the material around  
**[0:36:53-0:36:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:36:53):**  them into a habitat where they find shelter.  
**[0:36:56-0:37:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:36:56):**  That's the ultimate gig for human design.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:37:01):**  And that's what we mean by permaculture, of course, but we rarely think of it in terms  
**[0:37:05-0:37:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:37:05):**  of urban form, because permaculturists mostly focus on domestic systems and planting guilds  
**[0:37:12-0:37:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:37:12):**  and things like that, but it applies to all scales.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:37:15):**  I don't know, thinking about homelessness, I'm learning constantly.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:37:20):**  Like the other day, there was an article released on the internet.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:37:26):**  There was a study done, I think in Portland, on that for every $100 average increase in  
**[0:37:33-0:37:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:37:33):**  rent across the city, homelessness increases by 15%.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:37:39):**  That is not...  
**[0:37:40-0:37:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:37:40):**  Oh my God.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:37:41):**  Do you...  
**[0:37:42-0:37:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:37:42):**  No, it isn't.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:37:43):**  That tells us.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:37:44):**  And here's another thing related to that.  
**[0:37:47-0:37:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:37:47):**  When I was in Oakland a couple of years ago, doing a workshop on colonialism and gentrification,  
**[0:37:54-0:38:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:37:54):**  I learned from one of the participants and economists that the more that we allow...  
**[0:38:00-0:38:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:38:00):**  This is like, this is something to really, really take into consideration and give a  
**[0:38:07-0:38:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:38:07):**  lot of thought to.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:38:08):**  The more we allow the economic disparity to grow, the more that we have people amassing  
**[0:38:14-0:38:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:38:14):**  wealth whose only interest in wealth is more wealth.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:38:19):**  And wealthy people tend to keep so much of it available, just so much of it available  
**[0:38:25-0:38:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:38:25):**  for them to be able to use that's fluid.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:38:28):**  For the most part, they bank it in investments.  
**[0:38:33-0:38:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:38:33):**  Investments most often take the form of some kind of real estate development.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:38:38):**  So if you have all of this cash out there that needs to be invested in order to make  
**[0:38:42-0:38:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:38:42):**  more money, it causes the acceleration of gentrification because you're basically building  
**[0:38:48-0:38:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:38:48):**  all of these market rate housing units in order to provide an increasing return on investment.  
**[0:38:55-0:39:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:38:55):**  So the more we allow the disparity to grow, the faster gentrification accelerates.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:39:01):**  And all of that, of course, contributes tremendously to homelessness.  
**[0:39:07-0:39:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:39:07):**  We have a madness going on right now.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:39:10):**  I think one of the anecdotes is for people to realize the people in the streets all around  
**[0:39:16-0:39:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:39:16):**  them are maybe one or two degrees removed from them in terms of relationships.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:39:22):**  I have actually experienced that.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:39:26):**  I've actually met people that are the children of like my father's and mother's old friends,  
**[0:39:33-0:39:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:39:33):**  people that I went to school with, but then I meet who are out in the streets.  
**[0:39:38-0:39:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:39:38):**  And I learned something that happened to them in the course of their lives that I was close  
**[0:39:42-0:39:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:39:42):**  to myself and I didn't realize what had happened to them.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:39:46):**  I've seen people run into each other in a car and get mad at each other in my own neighborhood  
**[0:39:52-0:39:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:39:52):**  and start to fight only to be pulled apart by their wives saying things like, don't you  
**[0:39:57-0:39:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:39:57):**  realize like who you are?  
**[0:39:59-0:40:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:39:59):**  You guys used to be friends in school.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:40:02):**  But they're so far from remembering each other because of isolation or lack of continuity  
**[0:40:08-0:40:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:40:08):**  in their lives that they don't even realize that they just finally had a chance to meet  
**[0:40:12-0:40:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:40:12):**  their old friends.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:40:13):**  And unfortunately, it took a car accident to do it.  
**[0:40:17-0:40:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:40:17):**  I'm going on and on about paradox here.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:40:20):**  But I think fundamentally for us to look at other people out in the street and just call  
**[0:40:24-0:40:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:40:24):**  them mere homeless people and treat them as if they're invisible pariahs or something  
**[0:40:28-0:40:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:40:28):**  is a terrible, terrible state of mind for us all.  
**[0:40:33-0:40:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:40:33):**  It's not just terrible for the homeless people.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:40:35):**  Like for us to walk around in such ignorance, being oblivious to our fundamental connection  
**[0:40:39-0:40:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:40:39):**  to other people around us and all that we share, I swear, even if they're homeless and  
**[0:40:45-0:40:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:40:45):**  you got a home, you're still cultural refugees.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:40:48):**  I think the fact that you're even alive in the 21st century is a testament to your resilience  
**[0:40:54-0:40:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:40:54):**  that you've survived through all of these convolutions of human history.  
**[0:40:58-0:41:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:40:58):**  I would rather walk around appreciating the fact that we're still here, that projecting  
**[0:41:03-0:41:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:41:03):**  onto each other and saying, oh, you're of a lesser class because you have less than  
**[0:41:07-0:41:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:41:07):**  me.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:41:08):**  That's like playing life as if it's a Monopoly board game or something.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:41:13):**  Mark's philosophy on design and how it should be leveraged as well as his concepts and thinking  
**[0:41:17-0:41:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:41:17):**  around healthy community dynamics is something that I would encourage anyone to look into  
**[0:41:22-0:41:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:41:22):**  further.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:41:23):**  If for no other reason than to envision a future and a lifestyle in which your surroundings  
**[0:41:27-0:41:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:41:27):**  don't cause you to feel so lonely and separated.  
**[0:41:31-0:41:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:41:31):**  You asked me what keeps me going.  
**[0:41:33-0:41:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:41:33):**  Part of it is outrage.  
**[0:41:34-0:41:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:41:34):**  Like I see that we're, every one of us, including rich people, are swept up in something so  
**[0:41:39-0:41:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:41:39):**  big we no longer understand it.  
**[0:41:42-0:41:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:41:42):**  It's so painful to us, maybe especially rich people, because they end up being impoverished  
**[0:41:47-0:41:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:41:47):**  spiritually.  
**[0:41:50-0:41:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:41:50):**  It's beyond comprehension and its tragedy is beyond our ability to grasp.  
**[0:41:55-0:41:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:41:55):**  There's that.  
**[0:41:56-0:41:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:41:56):**  I'm motivated by that.  
**[0:41:58-0:42:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:41:58):**  On the other hand, on the other side of the tragedy, and this is something that this same  
**[0:42:02-0:42:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:42:02):**  Mayan person said to me, he held up his hand and he's like, this side of my palm is everything  
**[0:42:06-0:42:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:42:06):**  that's wrong that obscures us from seeing what's on the other side of my palm.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:42:10):**  And he turns his hand around and he's like, on this side is to see the luminous reality  
**[0:42:15-0:42:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:42:15):**  that we are on a floating garden sphere.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:42:20):**  The only life that we know of in all the cosmos is here.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:42:25):**  This is home.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:42:26):**  We are home.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:42:27):**  We are all home together.  
**[0:42:29-0:42:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:42:29):**  And if we can see that everything is here and that everything that we need is provided  
**[0:42:33-0:42:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:42:33):**  for to us as a gift and an expression of love, if we can see that we are all leaves on the  
**[0:42:39-0:42:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:42:39):**  tree of life and somehow act from a place of seeing our larger self with each other,  
**[0:42:44-0:42:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:42:44):**  then we will be okay and we will thrive.  
**[0:42:48-0:42:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:42:48):**  And to let glimpse, you know, the possibility of actually inhabiting that awareness and  
**[0:42:54-0:42:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:42:54):**  taking care of each other and going to new levels of aesthetic appreciation and experience  
**[0:42:59-0:43:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:42:59):**  with each other like that, however, that's what's keeping me going is to see what's on  
**[0:43:05-0:43:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:43:05):**  the other side of all of this despair is all of this like promise, birthright.  
**[0:43:14-0:43:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:43:14):**  That inspires me constantly all the way till I'm dust.  
**[0:43:17-0:43:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:43:17):**  I'll be inspired by that because I already know that stuff.  
**[0:43:20-0:43:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:43:20):**  Like, oh my God.  
**[0:43:21-0:43:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:43:21):**  We live in the most amazing place that gets me up every morning.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:43:25):**  Even the tragedy.  
**[0:43:26-0:43:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:43:26):**  That's the thing.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:43:27):**  Like we go to Mars, sitting through dust, looking for one organic molecule, you know,  
**[0:43:32-0:43:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:43:32):**  and then we come back here and we're like, all around us, we're surrounded by evidence  
**[0:43:39-0:43:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:43:39):**  of the miraculous.  
**[0:43:40-0:43:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:43:40):**  And I feel that pretty much every day.  
**[0:43:43-0:43:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:43:43):**  It's it's it would be a hell of a lot better.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:43:46):**  If billions of us were seeing that together because that cumulative celebration would  
**[0:43:51-0:43:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:43:51):**  be the best thing we ever experienced.  
**[0:43:57-0:44:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:43:57):**  A topic that I've wanted to focus on for a while is that of the potential combinations  
**[0:44:08-0:44:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:44:08):**  of industrial and natural buildings.  
**[0:44:11-0:44:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:44:11):**  This series wouldn't be complete without a look at how our crumbling and outdated infrastructure  
**[0:44:16-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:44:16):**  might be updated in a more ecological way.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:44:19):**  I also firmly believe that making the most of our existing buildings and remodeling and  
**[0:44:23-0:44:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:44:23):**  renovating them rather than just demolishing them and starting from scratch is a much more  
**[0:44:28-0:44:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:44:28):**  responsible ecological decision, even if the building you replace it with is natural.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:44:34):**  I got to explore this topic with April McGill, who I had previously interviewed on the subject  
**[0:44:38-0:44:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:44:38):**  of rammed earth.  
**[0:44:39-0:44:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:44:39):**  She's also the owner and operator of the natural building and design architectural firm called  
**[0:44:44-0:44:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:44:44):**  Rootdown Designs.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:44:46):**  This time around, we started by talking about hempcrete and how she's been experimenting  
**[0:44:50-0:44:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:44:50):**  with this relatively new material, as well as its potential uses in home renovations,  
**[0:44:55-0:44:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:44:55):**  especially in thermal efficiency advantages for humid regions.  
**[0:44:59-0:45:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:44:59):**  Hempcrete was established in Europe, I believe a couple of decades ago.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:45:07):**  And it's just a method of taking the hemp fiber and combining it with a lime slurry,  
**[0:45:20-0:45:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:45:20):**  and you're making a lightweight insulation that gets packed in between formwork.  
**[0:45:27-0:45:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:45:27):**  And so it can be integrated with stud framing or timber framing.  
**[0:45:33-0:45:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:45:33):**  It really works hand in hand with conventional framing methods.  
**[0:45:39-0:45:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:45:39):**  But essentially it's a lightweight insulation that is breathable, vapor permeable, rot-proof,  
**[0:45:51-0:45:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:45:51):**  mold-proof, termite-proof, and fire-resistant.  
**[0:45:56-0:46:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:45:56):**  And then it's also a carbon sequester in that the hemp fiber itself, as it grows, is sequestering  
**[0:46:07-0:46:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:46:07):**  carbon from the atmosphere and storing that in its fiber.  
**[0:46:13-0:46:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:46:13):**  And then lime also, as it continues to cure over the course of many, many, many years,  
**[0:46:22-0:46:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:46:22):**  continues to suck carbon from the atmosphere.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:46:23):**  So we see hempcrete as a carbon negative material for its ability to continue to suck carbon  
**[0:46:33-0:46:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:46:33):**  out of the atmosphere.  
**[0:46:35-0:46:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:46:35):**  It's also being produced with a rapidly renewable resource, no toxins, no VOCs.  
**[0:46:44-0:46:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:46:44):**  And one of the biggest pros that I see for especially my climate region where it's so  
**[0:46:51-0:46:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:46:51):**  wet is its ability to handle moisture.  
**[0:46:55-0:47:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:46:55):**  I don't have the numbers right in front of me, but I know that it has the ability to  
**[0:47:02-0:47:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:47:02):**  take on an incredible amount of moisture and store it in its walls without failing or developing  
**[0:47:12-0:47:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:47:12):**  mold or mildews.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:47:14):**  And so I think that's a really, really strong quality for my region.  
**[0:47:20-0:47:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:47:20):**  And as far as the limitations go, I would say at this point, we're still sourcing of  
**[0:47:29-0:47:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:47:29):**  the hemp fiber itself is still a bit challenging.  
**[0:47:32-0:47:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:47:32):**  You can order from Canada where it's being grown more abundantly.  
**[0:47:39-0:47:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:47:39):**  The United States is on the up and up with hemp production, but most people, most of  
**[0:47:46-0:47:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:47:46):**  the farmers growing hemp are growing for seed, for the CBD oils and whatnot.  
**[0:47:52-0:47:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:47:52):**  And there's only a few operations growing the fiber.  
**[0:47:58-0:48:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:47:58):**  So there are a couple of operations, but the resources are still a bit limited.  
**[0:48:09-0:48:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:48:09):**  And then also as with many of our alternative methods, having people who can build with  
**[0:48:17-0:48:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:48:17):**  that material.  
**[0:48:18-0:48:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:48:18):**  So having qualified builders remains to be one of the big challenges that we face, I  
**[0:48:25-0:48:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:48:25):**  think with all of these methods is building up our supply of qualified people who understand  
**[0:48:33-0:48:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:48:33):**  the method and who can build with it.  
**[0:48:35-0:48:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:48:35):**  We went on from there to talk about the technical and practical details about hempcrete, which  
**[0:48:40-0:48:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:48:40):**  left me with a much better understanding of this natural building material that I haven't  
**[0:48:43-0:48:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:48:43):**  yet worked with.  
**[0:48:45-0:48:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:48:45):**  My favorite part in the end though, was hearing April's insights on how to improve the indoor  
**[0:48:49-0:48:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:48:49):**  air quality of a home.  
**[0:48:51-0:48:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:48:51):**  Many people incorrectly think that the pollution in the air outside is worse than inside, especially  
**[0:48:55-0:48:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:48:55):**  if they live near highways or in cities.  
**[0:48:58-0:49:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:48:58):**  But in fact, the opposite is true.  
**[0:49:01-0:49:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:49:01):**  We have some colleagues that we're working with that are in the green product world.  
**[0:49:10-0:49:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:49:10):**  So they are the experts on products and materials.  
**[0:49:15-0:49:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:49:15):**  And so we go to them to help us specify the right things for our interiors.  
**[0:49:24-0:49:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:49:24):**  And I mean everything from joint compound on your drywall to the drywall itself, making  
**[0:49:30-0:49:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:49:30):**  sure your drywall doesn't have formaldehyde to the sealer that's going on your floor,  
**[0:49:40-0:49:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:49:40):**  looking at flooring itself, staying away from a lot of your composites, things that have  
**[0:49:49-0:49:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:49:49):**  a lot of glues in it are going to be more toxic.  
**[0:49:52-0:49:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:49:52):**  You're going to have more of those harmful VOCs and the red list chemicals.  
**[0:49:57-0:50:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:49:57):**  Unfortunately, the more inexpensive materials are the ones that are also full of toxic stuff,  
**[0:50:05-0:50:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:50:05):**  as you can I'm sure imagine.  
**[0:50:09-0:50:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:50:09):**  And I think it really just starts with education and awareness.  
**[0:50:14-0:50:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:50:14):**  We had to educate ourselves first.  
**[0:50:17-0:50:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:50:17):**  And so what we've done, what we're doing and in the process of doing is putting together  
**[0:50:24-0:50:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:50:24):**  interior design packages that are healthy home interior packages.  
**[0:50:29-0:50:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:50:29):**  So we're getting to where we are able to put together a comprehensive list of materials,  
**[0:50:37-0:50:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:50:37):**  everything from your flooring, floors to your ceilings, to your plumbing fixtures of materials  
**[0:50:46-0:50:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:50:46):**  that do not contain any red list chemicals or any of the known harmful VOCs.  
**[0:50:54-0:51:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:50:54):**  So it's a big task, but that's what our focus is on.  
**[0:51:02-0:51:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:51:02):**  And we're really trying to create spaces for people that will result in good indoor air  
**[0:51:10-0:51:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:51:10):**  quality.  
**[0:51:12-0:51:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:51:12):**  The more research I do about the dangers of industrial chemicals and the building materials  
**[0:51:15-0:51:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:51:15):**  that are involved, the more motivated I am to create healthy living spaces and to educate  
**[0:51:20-0:51:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:51:20):**  others on the toxicity of industrial homes.  
**[0:51:24-0:51:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:51:24):**  Like so many other things in life, the cheapest options are often the most expensive in the  
**[0:51:28-0:51:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:51:28):**  long run.  
**[0:51:29-0:51:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:51:29):**  A plastic or polymer based sealant or a composite material in your home might last a long time  
**[0:51:34-0:51:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:51:34):**  and be cheap when you buy it, but if it means that you'll be paying a hefty medical bill  
**[0:51:39-0:51:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:51:39):**  or even losing your quality of life over time, was it really all that cheap?  
**[0:51:44-0:51:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:51:44):**  We covered some really good topics in this chat and I really recommend it, especially  
**[0:51:48-0:52:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:51:48):**  to people who suffer from respiratory issues.  
**[0:52:01-0:52:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:52:01):**  From there, the interview that I did with Daniel Allen was one that I've been on the  
**[0:52:06-0:52:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:52:06):**  fence about for a long time, since Daniel came to talk about a product called AirCrete,  
**[0:52:11-0:52:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:52:11):**  which is a cement based material.  
**[0:52:12-0:52:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:52:12):**  I was hesitant for a long time to include an episode on a cement based material because  
**[0:52:17-0:52:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:52:17):**  I strongly believe that natural, minimally processed and local materials can be leveraged  
**[0:52:23-0:52:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:52:23):**  as the main materials for any reasonable building project.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:52:26):**  In the end though, I saw this as a good opportunity to have a larger discussion about what we  
**[0:52:31-0:52:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:52:31):**  consider to be natural materials and where the line in material choice for natural buildings  
**[0:52:36-0:52:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:52:36):**  and environmentally responsible construction is.  
**[0:52:40-0:52:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:52:40):**  Daniel actually comes from a natural building background himself and has worked and built  
**[0:52:44-0:52:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:52:44):**  with all the main materials that we'd otherwise consider in this category.  
**[0:52:49-0:52:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:52:49):**  I was really happy with the result of this conversation because not only did Daniel have  
**[0:52:52-0:52:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:52:52):**  great insights on how to look at different building materials from an ecological perspective,  
**[0:52:58-0:53:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:52:58):**  but we also got to talk a lot about what a regenerative lifestyle means aside from the  
**[0:53:03-0:53:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:53:03):**  building itself.  
**[0:53:05-0:53:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:53:05):**  It's the very lifestyles that we live and the value that we place on things that I think  
**[0:53:10-0:53:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:53:10):**  may be the core issue.  
**[0:53:11-0:53:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:53:11):**  For example, I could go out on my property and just using the small trees and sticks  
**[0:53:18-0:53:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:53:18):**  and limbs, I could build a double walled wattle and daub house.  
**[0:53:23-0:53:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:53:23):**  Maybe I put a liner in the bottom for waterproofing and then I fill it with a straw to give me  
**[0:53:28-0:53:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:53:28):**  an R32 insulating house that's built 99% free from local onsite materials.  
**[0:53:36-0:53:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:53:36):**  But the way society is structured, it's so much more quote valuable to use my time to  
**[0:53:42-0:53:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:53:42):**  just go buy a truckload of clay and a truckload of sand and some timber and a saw, cut it  
**[0:53:48-0:53:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:53:48):**  up and then assemble an artificial structure out of natural materials.  
**[0:53:55-0:54:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:53:55):**  There's always that struggle there because like you said, you can make an alternative  
**[0:54:01-0:54:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:54:01):**  building, it can be as industrial and more costly and more harmful even than buying something  
**[0:54:08-0:54:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:54:08):**  from a larger source.  
**[0:54:11-0:54:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:54:11):**  So it's kind of like that permaculture saying, it depends, right?  
**[0:54:15-0:54:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:54:15):**  In relation to the interview with Daniel, one of the best bits of feedback that I've  
**[0:54:19-0:54:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:54:19):**  gotten in a while came in the response to this episode in a comment by Wendy Howard  
**[0:54:25-0:54:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:54:25):**  in which she writes, how can a resource be a problem?  
**[0:54:29-0:54:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:54:29):**  It is what it is.  
**[0:54:30-0:54:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:54:30):**  Surely, it's only an ever-hour use and management of that resource that causes problems.  
**[0:54:36-0:54:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:54:36):**  It's our rate of resource use well in excess of what's appropriate to live a good and happy  
**[0:54:40-0:54:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:54:40):**  life as part of this planet and well in excess of what can be replaced by natural processes  
**[0:54:46-0:54:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:54:46):**  that's causing problems.  
**[0:54:48-0:54:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:54:48):**  If we were using lime instead of cement, trees instead of steel, we would still be seeing  
**[0:54:52-0:54:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:54:52):**  no less ecosystem destruction.  
**[0:54:55-0:54:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:54:55):**  We have completely lost our way.  
**[0:54:57-0:55:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:54:57):**  Our rate of consumption is in all senses of the phrase out of order.  
**[0:55:01-0:55:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:55:01):**  Fueled by an arrogant delusion that nature exists only for us to exploit, besotted with  
**[0:55:06-0:55:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:55:06):**  our cleverness and ability to make stuff, driven by the insane desire to amass as many  
**[0:55:11-0:55:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:55:11):**  small green pieces of paper as possible, we completely fail to see the extent of our utter  
**[0:55:17-0:55:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:55:17):**  stupidity and the gross negligence of our responsibility to the living system on which  
**[0:55:21-0:55:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:55:21):**  all life on earth depends.  
**[0:55:24-0:55:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:55:24):**  We even have the arrogance to think we know better than nature, all the while surrounded  
**[0:55:28-0:55:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:55:28):**  by the glaring evidence that we've barely even begun to understand it.  
**[0:55:33-0:55:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:55:33):**  My definition of regenerative living is to live humbly, within limits, sitting at the  
**[0:55:37-0:55:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:55:37):**  feet of nature every day to learn how best to take care of earth and restore it to health.  
**[0:55:42-0:55:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:55:42):**  It's not so much about what we do it with, it's how we do it.  
**[0:55:46-0:55:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:55:46):**  We once made our tools to last generations instead of six months, and repaired them when  
**[0:55:51-0:55:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:55:51):**  they broke instead of throwing them away, built homes with love and care to pass down  
**[0:55:55-0:55:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:55:55):**  to our grandchildren instead of how much money we could trade them in for.  
**[0:55:59-0:56:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:55:59):**  It's the thinking behind how we live that matters.  
**[0:56:02-0:56:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:56:02):**  We need to find our way back to living in harmony with the earth."  
**[0:56:06-0:56:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:56:06):**  So thank you Wendy for writing that in.  
**[0:56:08-0:56:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:56:08):**  I waited until now to respond to that comment which I think is a very important reminder  
**[0:56:13-0:56:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:56:13):**  throughout this whole process of deciding the most responsible way to live.  
**[0:56:18-0:56:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:56:18):**  While it's easy to get caught up in the details of materials and design considerations, if  
**[0:56:22-0:56:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:56:22):**  we lose sight of living within the capacity for life and the resources that we have around  
**[0:56:27-0:56:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:56:27):**  us, we can get swept up in the prevailing cultural narrative that only values growth,  
**[0:56:33-0:56:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:56:33):**  expansion, profits, extraction, and domination of our surroundings as a natural association  
**[0:56:38-0:56:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:56:38):**  that propels them.  
**[0:56:39-0:56:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:56:39):**  I also really agree that it doesn't matter what materials that we choose if we use them  
**[0:56:43-0:56:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:56:43):**  in a destructive and exploitative way, even mud buildings can be over extracted from the  
**[0:56:49-0:56:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:56:49):**  land and done in a destructive way that's not respectful to the life carrying capacity  
**[0:56:54-0:56:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:56:54):**  of that region.  
**[0:56:55-0:56:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:56:55):**  I also agree to a point that regenerative living is to live humbly within the carrying  
**[0:56:59-0:57:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:56:59):**  capacity of our place and ecosystem, but to me the important distinction between this  
**[0:57:03-0:57:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:57:03):**  definition which sounds to me a lot like sustainability, is to use the ingenuity and surplus of energy  
**[0:57:10-0:57:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:57:10):**  that hopefully we find, to then work towards increasing the capacity of all forms of life  
**[0:57:17-0:57:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:57:17):**  within those same parameters.  
**[0:57:19-0:57:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:57:19):**  To me that's the distinction between sustainable and regenerative living, and that's why I  
**[0:57:23-0:57:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:57:23):**  really try and separate the two.  
**[0:57:25-0:57:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:57:25):**  I'm convinced that merely trying to get by with less and minimize our destruction to  
**[0:57:29-0:57:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:57:29):**  the point where we can limp forward with a broken cultural narrative for longer than  
**[0:57:34-0:57:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:57:34):**  we currently have, is an exercise in futility and that, though natural building is only  
**[0:57:39-0:57:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:57:39):**  one step in a multifaceted look at regenerative living, it can help us ask questions that  
**[0:57:45-0:57:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:57:45):**  change the lens and the narrative that we look at our potential future with.  
**[0:57:49-0:57:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:57:49):**  I want to continue to challenge myself to ask, how can the way that I live create abundance  
**[0:57:54-0:58:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:57:54):**  and resilience for all life around me, rather than how can the way that I live cause less  
**[0:58:00-0:58:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:58:00):**  destruction and consumption.  
**[0:58:01-0:58:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:58:01):**  While that's a very valid concern and aspiration, I think it leads to a complete dead end.  
**[0:58:08-0:58:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:58:08):**  Basically if your entire goal in life is to stop consuming and stop destroying things  
**[0:58:13-0:58:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:58:13):**  in your need to survive, the only logical end to that line of thinking is to end your  
**[0:58:18-0:58:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:58:18):**  life.  
**[0:58:19-0:58:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:58:19):**  Consumption obviously is a necessary part of a healthy life.  
**[0:58:22-0:58:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:58:22):**  You have to consume in order to go forward.  
**[0:58:26-0:58:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:58:26):**  It's what propels us and it's what propels all other forms of life.  
**[0:58:30-0:58:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:58:30):**  However at the end of this episode I'll address some of the other questions that come out  
**[0:58:34-0:58:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:58:34):**  of this too.  
**[0:58:47-0:58:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:58:47):**  So after wrestling with the limits of acceptable materials for natural buildings, I wanted  
**[0:58:52-0:58:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:58:52):**  to tackle another area of building and our lifestyles that needs drastic solutions and  
**[0:58:57-0:58:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:58:57):**  that's the topic of energy.  
**[0:58:58-0:59:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:58:58):**  So many of us feel disconnected from our energy sources or view them as necessary evils of  
**[0:59:03-0:59:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:59:03):**  modern living.  
**[0:59:05-0:59:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:59:05):**  I've always wanted to know more about what options are out there for renewable energy  
**[0:59:08-0:59:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:59:08):**  production on the home scale, so I reached out to Dan Chiras, an expert and prolific  
**[0:59:14-0:59:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:59:14):**  author of the books such as Solar Electricity Basics, Power from the Wind, Power from the  
**[0:59:20-0:59:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:59:20):**  Sun, Solar Home Heating Basics, The Homeowner's Guide to Renewable Energy, Green Transportation  
**[0:59:26-0:59:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:59:26):**  Basics and many more.  
**[0:59:28-0:59:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:59:28):**  This ended up being a very useful interview and I learned a ton personally from the way  
**[0:59:33-0:59:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:59:33):**  that Dan summarized the array of options out there around solar and wind especially, but  
**[0:59:38-0:59:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:59:38):**  we also addressed some of the lesser known options like micro hydro.  
**[0:59:42-0:59:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:59:42):**  We talked prices, sizing systems, output potential of different regions and a lot more.  
**[0:59:47-0:59:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:59:47):**  And I left feeling like I had a much better grasp of a very broad topic, especially on  
**[0:59:52-0:59:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:59:52):**  some of the key bits of information that everyone should know, way before worrying about the  
**[0:59:56-1:00:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=0:59:56):**  details and prices that can scare non DIY savvy people early on.  
**[1:00:01-1:00:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:00:01):**  How much energy do you use?  
**[1:00:04-1:00:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:00:04):**  Where can we cut back?  
**[1:00:06-1:00:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:00:06):**  Let's do that.  
**[1:00:08-1:00:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:00:08):**  Now let's think about the solar system or a wind system.  
**[1:00:12-1:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:00:12):**  And the next level of thinking is do I want grid tied, off grid or grid tied with battery  
**[1:00:18-1:00:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:00:18):**  backup?  
**[1:00:19-1:00:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:00:19):**  And then you have to just select the system that's going to work for you.  
**[1:00:23-1:00:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:00:23):**  Are you in a good wind site?  
**[1:00:26-1:00:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:00:26):**  Are you in just a good solar site?  
**[1:00:28-1:00:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:00:28):**  Do you need solar electricity and hot water?  
**[1:00:32-1:00:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:00:32):**  Now that's the thinking process really is it?  
**[1:00:36-1:00:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:00:36):**  How can we be more efficient?  
**[1:00:38-1:00:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:00:38):**  What kind of system do I want?  
**[1:00:40-1:00:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:00:40):**  Do I want to be off the grid or do I want to have that backup power or do I just not  
**[1:00:44-1:00:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:00:44):**  care?  
**[1:00:45-1:00:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:00:45):**  You know, are grid interruptions so rare that it doesn't make sense for me to go off?  
**[1:00:52-1:01:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:00:52):**  And then you have to carefully select whether you want solar electric or wind electric or  
**[1:01:00-1:01:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:01:00):**  micro hydro.  
**[1:01:03-1:01:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:01:03):**  But don't forget hot water.  
**[1:01:05-1:01:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:01:05):**  Don't forget space heating.  
**[1:01:06-1:01:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:01:06):**  I mean, that's pretty, we pretty much covered it.  
**[1:01:10-1:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:01:10):**  And if you start looking for installers, find someone who's been in the business for a while.  
**[1:01:18-1:01:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:01:18):**  It just makes sense to go with people that have been doing it for a goodly amount of  
**[1:01:22-1:01:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:01:22):**  time.  
**[1:01:23-1:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:01:23):**  They have the most experience, they know what they're doing.  
**[1:01:26-1:01:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:01:26):**  So look, when you shop around, I hate to say this to all the newbies in the field, but  
**[1:01:32-1:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:01:32):**  just look for people who have been in the business for a while and maybe five or 10  
**[1:01:37-1:01:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:01:37):**  years and look at how many systems they've installed, what kind of reputation they have.  
**[1:01:43-1:01:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:01:43):**  It's really good to check out in advance, call some of their customers and how were  
**[1:01:49-1:01:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:01:49):**  they?  
**[1:01:50-1:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:01:50):**  Did they get the work done quickly?  
**[1:01:51-1:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:01:51):**  Did they do a good job?  
**[1:01:52-1:01:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:01:52):**  You know, were they clean?  
**[1:01:54-1:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:01:54):**  You know, did they clean up the work site?  
**[1:01:57-1:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:01:57):**  If you had a problem, were they there the next day or two days later, not two months  
**[1:02:03-1:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:02:03):**  later?  
**[1:02:04-1:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:02:04):**  And that's the sort of thing you need to look into as well.  
**[1:02:07-1:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:02:07):**  The best part about this interview to me is that it applies to any kind of building, natural  
**[1:02:12-1:02:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:02:12):**  or industrial energy use, consumption and the source of energy are things that everyone  
**[1:02:17-1:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:02:17):**  can work to improve.  
**[1:02:19-1:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:02:19):**  Where it applies to new and natural buildings, though, is in the design phase before any  
**[1:02:24-1:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:02:24):**  building actually starts.  
**[1:02:27-1:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:02:27):**  Now we tend to get stuck on electricity, but there are a lot of other ways to use renewable  
**[1:02:35-1:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:02:35):**  energy.  
**[1:02:36-1:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:02:36):**  For example, I have always heated my homes with passive solar.  
**[1:02:42-1:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:02:42):**  And this is one of the things I always tell people is passive solar is basically you're  
**[1:02:47-1:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:02:47):**  designing your house and orienting your house so that it will absorb that low angle winter  
**[1:02:55-1:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:02:55):**  sun during the period that you need it the most, when you need heat the most.  
**[1:03:00-1:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:03:00):**  And so you basically build a home so that it's oriented in such a way and you build  
**[1:03:06-1:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:03:06):**  it so the windows on the south side, there are more windows in the south side, and what  
**[1:03:11-1:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:03:11):**  they do is they capture that low angle winter sun and provide heat throughout the winter  
**[1:03:16-1:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:03:16):**  for free.  
**[1:03:17-1:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:03:17):**  It's really a highly overlooked technology, extremely cost effective.  
**[1:03:24-1:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:03:24):**  I always joke that it's such an important free source of energy that there ought to  
**[1:03:30-1:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:03:30):**  be a national law requiring every home builder to install some kind of passive solar.  
**[1:03:36-1:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:03:36):**  Now I'm not proposing that.  
**[1:03:39-1:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:03:39):**  I don't want anybody to call me up and call me a socialist.  
**[1:03:42-1:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:03:42):**  But the fact of the matter is it's just free heating for life.  
**[1:03:47-1:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:03:47):**  And if you could, every house that was built in this country could just include 25%.  
**[1:03:53-1:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:03:53):**  That's a significant impact that would have a significant impact on the amount of energy  
**[1:03:59-1:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:03:59):**  we use to heat our homes.  
**[1:04:01-1:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:04:01):**  Now what's really cool about passive solar, this idea of just capturing that low angle  
**[1:04:07-1:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:04:07):**  winter sun through south facing windows, is everything you do to incorporate passive solar  
**[1:04:13-1:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:04:13):**  heating will actually help your home stay cooler in the summer.  
**[1:04:18-1:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:04:18):**  Now I don't have time to go into all that.  
**[1:04:20-1:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:04:20):**  You can find that in my books, but so you're getting more bang for your buck.  
**[1:04:25-1:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:04:25):**  You're getting a warmer home.  
**[1:04:26-1:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:04:26):**  Home is going to be naturally warmer in the winter and naturally cooler in the summer.  
**[1:04:32-1:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:04:32):**  So you're going to save on heating and cooling costs at very little additional expense, very,  
**[1:04:38-1:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:04:38):**  very little additional expense.  
**[1:04:39-1:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:04:39):**  So that's something that people really ought to consider if they're looking at building  
**[1:04:44-1:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:04:44):**  a retirement home or just starting their very first home.  
**[1:04:48-1:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:04:48):**  Look into the passive solar heating and cooling and design that home so you get anywhere from  
**[1:04:53-1:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:04:53):**  50 to 80% of your heating and cooling for free.  
**[1:04:59-1:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:04:59):**  It's pretty phenomenal bargain for just a little bit of intelligent design.  
**[1:05:05-1:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:05:05):**  So this turned out to be a really good condensed resource to get anyone caught up on renewable  
**[1:05:09-1:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:05:09):**  energy, especially at small scales.  
**[1:05:21-1:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:05:21):**  Next I had an interview that I had been looking forward to a long time and that many of you  
**[1:05:25-1:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:05:25):**  listeners had requested as well.  
**[1:05:27-1:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:05:27):**  I've been watching, as many of you have, the videos that Benito Steen has been putting  
**[1:05:32-1:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:05:32):**  together with his brother on their YouTube channel called the Nito Project since they  
**[1:05:36-1:05:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:05:36):**  first launched just a short while ago.  
**[1:05:39-1:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:05:39):**  Even before then, I've seen ads and posts for Benito's plastering workshops in places  
**[1:05:43-1:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:05:43):**  like Rancho Mastatal and have often thought about how great it is that these skills and  
**[1:05:48-1:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:05:48):**  aesthetic techniques are being revived by a whole new generation.  
**[1:05:52-1:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:05:52):**  So when I finally got to chat with Benito, we ended up covering a whole lot of ground.  
**[1:05:57-1:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:05:57):**  One of the fascinating things about Benito's perspective is that he's the only person I  
**[1:06:01-1:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:06:01):**  know who actually grew up in modern natural buildings.  
**[1:06:04-1:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:06:04):**  His parents Bill and Athena Steen are well known experts and educators on traditional  
**[1:06:08-1:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:06:08):**  building methods of the American Southwest and authors and advocates for straw bale building  
**[1:06:13-1:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:06:13):**  around the world.  
**[1:06:15-1:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:06:15):**  We ended up talking about his insights on growing up in that environment and learning  
**[1:06:20-1:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:06:20):**  natural building from a young age.  
**[1:06:23-1:06:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:06:23):**  It's much easier to like learn some of those things like plastering when you're that young  
**[1:06:29-1:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:06:29):**  because it's more like plastering is much more like a language where it's not it's not  
**[1:06:38-1:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:06:38):**  a theoretical of a skill.  
**[1:06:43-1:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:06:43):**  It's just more the feeling and like that action.  
**[1:06:45-1:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:06:45):**  And I think it's been a lot to me trying to teach people like thinking about how to try  
**[1:06:52-1:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:06:52):**  to get people back to that like child place and not be so conscious in their movements,  
**[1:06:58-1:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:06:58):**  but actually being more aware.  
**[1:07:01-1:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:07:01):**  We also shared a lot of stories and chatted about teaching around the world and the cultural  
**[1:07:05-1:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:07:05):**  differences around building that we've seen.  
**[1:07:08-1:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:07:08):**  The interview ended up being more of a chat than a question and answer format, but I also  
**[1:07:12-1:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:07:12):**  learned a lot from his experience in other trades and experimentation in new projects.  
**[1:07:17-1:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:07:17):**  I get a lot of joy out of connecting with others who've traveled around a lot to learn  
**[1:07:21-1:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:07:21):**  these trades and hearing what they've learned in the process, not just technically, but  
**[1:07:26-1:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:07:26):**  through differences in experiences and the more human aspects as well.  
**[1:07:36-1:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:07:36):**  One of my favorite recurring guests on this show is Atulia Bingham.  
**[1:07:39-1:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:07:39):**  Not only does she have an amazing personal story of living off grid in an earthen home  
**[1:07:43-1:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:07:43):**  that she built for herself in Turkey before hitting the road to travel Europe in her camper  
**[1:07:48-1:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:07:48):**  van and then resettling in northern Spain where she's now restoring an old stone building  
**[1:07:53-1:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:07:53):**  with natural materials.  
**[1:07:55-1:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:07:55):**  She also manages to write books, a great blog on mud building, and release online courses.  
**[1:08:01-1:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:08:01):**  Her latest course is all about lime, one of my favorite earthen materials and one of the  
**[1:08:05-1:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:08:05):**  most versatile for all kinds of applications.  
**[1:08:08-1:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:08:08):**  But I wanted to know first why someone would choose lime over cement.  
**[1:08:12-1:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:08:12):**  Oh yeah, the perfect question.  
**[1:08:15-1:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:08:15):**  The question I love to answer.  
**[1:08:17-1:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:08:17):**  Me too.  
**[1:08:18-1:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:08:18):**  Why would you use lime instead of...  
**[1:08:24-1:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:08:24):**  Well, there's so many reasons.  
**[1:08:30-1:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:08:30):**  There's so, so many reasons.  
**[1:08:31-1:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:08:31):**  Let's start with the environmental.  
**[1:08:34-1:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:08:34):**  Portland cement is the second biggest contributor to the greenhouse effect right now.  
**[1:08:41-1:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:08:41):**  Only beaten by fossil fuels.  
**[1:08:43-1:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:08:43):**  So the less Portland cement we can be using, obviously the better.  
**[1:08:49-1:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:08:49):**  But people always ask me, isn't lime just as bad?  
**[1:08:51-1:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:08:51):**  No, it's not.  
**[1:08:54-1:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:08:54):**  This takes about 25% of the carbon to produce lime than Portland cement.  
**[1:09:00-1:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:09:00):**  And lime over its lifespan reabsorbs that carbon back into itself.  
**[1:09:06-1:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:09:06):**  It takes a long time to do that, we should be honest.  
**[1:09:08-1:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:09:08):**  But it's slowly, slowly reabsorbing the carbon as it cures.  
**[1:09:15-1:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:09:15):**  And it cures and becomes harder and harder indefinitely.  
**[1:09:19-1:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:09:19):**  Which is why, because people will often say this, but the Raymonds use cement.  
**[1:09:24-1:09:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:09:24):**  No, they use limecrete.  
**[1:09:27-1:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:09:27):**  It was cement made with lime.  
**[1:09:29-1:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:09:29):**  It was not Portland cement, which we're using today.  
**[1:09:32-1:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:09:32):**  Portland cement has a lifespan of about 50 to 70 years.  
**[1:09:35-1:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:09:35):**  So unless it's very well reinforced with rebar or steel or something, it's not going to hold  
**[1:09:43-1:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:09:43):**  for much past 75 years.  
**[1:09:47-1:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:09:47):**  And you can see that in old buildings where it starts crumbling away.  
**[1:09:52-1:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:09:52):**  But lime doesn't do that at all.  
**[1:09:54-1:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:09:54):**  Lime continually becomes more and more enduring as it cures over time.  
**[1:09:59-1:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:09:59):**  So it gets harder and harder and harder.  
**[1:10:01-1:10:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:10:01):**  And that's why we still see those Roman viaducts and aqueducts and Roman buildings altogether  
**[1:10:08-1:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:10:08):**  that were mortared mostly with limecrete.  
**[1:10:12-1:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:10:12):**  And yeah, so that's one difference between Portland cement and lime.  
**[1:10:18-1:10:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:10:18):**  Another difference is the situation with damp.  
**[1:10:24-1:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:10:24):**  As I mentioned before, lime is brilliant in the wet.  
**[1:10:28-1:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:10:28):**  It has a drying effect.  
**[1:10:31-1:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:10:31):**  Because it's reabsorbing moisture from the air, it absorbs it.  
**[1:10:35-1:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:10:35):**  Sorry, not reabsorbing.  
**[1:10:36-1:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:10:36):**  It's absorbing moisture from the air all the time to cure.  
**[1:10:39-1:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:10:39):**  It loves the wet actually.  
**[1:10:40-1:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:10:40):**  And it just loves to eat water.  
**[1:10:43-1:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:10:43):**  Whereas Portland cement, Portland cement will actually hold onto the water and create a  
**[1:10:48-1:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:10:48):**  very damp feeling in the house.  
**[1:10:49-1:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:10:49):**  It actually wicks up water.  
**[1:10:51-1:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:10:51):**  And because it's not breathable, like lime is breathable, and so Portland cement will  
**[1:10:57-1:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:10:57):**  just create this airtight, wet box.  
**[1:11:01-1:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:11:01):**  And that's why Portland cement always feels cold when you touch it.  
**[1:11:04-1:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:11:04):**  Because it's actually slightly damp.  
**[1:11:07-1:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:11:07):**  And it's always too hot in the summer in hot climates.  
**[1:11:10-1:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:11:10):**  It's actually a very, well, it's a poor building material.  
**[1:11:14-1:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:11:14):**  And I'm sorry that people, it's so widespread.  
**[1:11:17-1:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:11:17):**  Because either mud or lime are far superior in different jobs of course.  
**[1:11:24-1:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:11:24):**  But both of those two materials are far superior to Portland cement.  
**[1:11:27-1:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:11:27):**  Unless of course you're building a massive flyover or a multi-story car park.  
**[1:11:33-1:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:11:33):**  But if you're normal for a house, I wouldn't use it in my house, Portland cement, personally  
**[1:11:38-1:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:11:38):**  for that reason.  
**[1:11:40-1:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:11:40):**  Another reason is the mold factor.  
**[1:11:43-1:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:11:43):**  You don't get mold with lime, as I've just pointed out.  
**[1:11:46-1:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:11:46):**  And there's one part in my kitchen, it's very interesting.  
**[1:11:50-1:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:11:50):**  Because I've used lime paint as well on the stone walls.  
**[1:11:54-1:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:11:54):**  And there's one part where I painted with a chalk paint instead of lime.  
**[1:12:00-1:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:12:00):**  Because it was wood.  
**[1:12:01-1:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:12:01):**  I was painting something with wood.  
**[1:12:02-1:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:12:02):**  And that particular part got covered in mold.  
**[1:12:05-1:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:12:05):**  Very interesting.  
**[1:12:06-1:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:12:06):**  And nowhere else is.  
**[1:12:07-1:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:12:07):**  Nothing that was covered in the lime has any mold on it.  
**[1:12:09-1:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:12:09):**  It's a fungicide.  
**[1:12:12-1:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:12:12):**  Mold cannot survive on lime.  
**[1:12:14-1:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:12:14):**  We ended up covering so much in this interview from different types of lime that you can  
**[1:12:18-1:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:12:18):**  buy or make yourself.  
**[1:12:19-1:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:12:19):**  All the different ways that it can be used and even application techniques and troubleshooting.  
**[1:12:23-1:12:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:12:23):**  But I especially liked her insights on how to color or add pigment to lime because that's  
**[1:12:28-1:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:12:28):**  one of the things that I've struggled with a lot in the past.  
**[1:12:32-1:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:12:32):**  To be honest dyes don't work very well.  
**[1:12:35-1:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:12:35):**  And the problem with lime is it bleaches.  
**[1:12:37-1:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:12:37):**  So it becomes much much lighter.  
**[1:12:40-1:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:12:40):**  And it's quite tricky to get a deep dark finish like you can with clay.  
**[1:12:46-1:12:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:12:46):**  That's also one of the reasons I used clay on one of my molds and not lime.  
**[1:12:50-1:12:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:12:50):**  I wanted this very kind of deep dark brown look.  
**[1:12:55-1:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:12:55):**  But what you need to do is just up your level of pigment much much more than you think.  
**[1:13:04-1:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:13:04):**  And add much darker tones than you think you're going to need.  
**[1:13:07-1:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:13:07):**  And you can add black or brown into the mix as well to give it a bit more depth.  
**[1:13:13-1:13:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:13:13):**  That's the only way you can really do it.  
**[1:13:16-1:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:13:16):**  And I find the best things to add are pigments.  
**[1:13:22-1:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:13:22):**  So for example iron oxide or red oxide, the oxides or clay.  
**[1:13:28-1:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:13:28):**  I actually get on very well.  
**[1:13:30-1:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:13:30):**  I've been mixing some very nice results from mixing clays with lime here and using that.  
**[1:13:36-1:13:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:13:36):**  So I highly recommend Atulia's course on lime for anyone looking to work with it for the  
**[1:13:40-1:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:13:40):**  first time or try a new application that you haven't experimented with before.  
**[1:13:44-1:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:13:44):**  So have a listen to the full episode to get a really in depth overview of all the potential  
**[1:13:48-1:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:13:48):**  with lime and then start making your own plasters, paints, and cretes at home.  
**[1:13:59-1:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:13:59):**  The last interview that I did in this series came in just at the last minute.  
**[1:14:04-1:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:14:04):**  The team from the Cobb Research Institute reached out to me to help spread their word  
**[1:14:07-1:14:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:14:07):**  on their campaign to get out the vote on their new proposal to include Cobb as a legal building  
**[1:14:13-1:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:14:13):**  material in the new International Residential Building Code.  
**[1:14:16-1:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:14:16):**  Getting to speak with John, Martin, and Anthony from the CRI team was really exciting since  
**[1:14:21-1:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:14:21):**  they've been working for many years and collaborating with other organizations around the world  
**[1:14:25-1:14:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:14:25):**  to legitimize the very material that I fell in love with and that inspired me to study  
**[1:14:30-1:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:14:30):**  more towards a career path in natural building.  
**[1:14:33-1:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:14:33):**  For me, the possibility of having this recognized in the code could open so many doors for owner-builders  
**[1:14:39-1:14:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:14:39):**  who aspire to build their own homes with the healthiest and most sustainable materials  
**[1:14:43-1:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:14:43):**  available to them.  
**[1:14:45-1:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:14:45):**  Despite how far this research has come, I still find that many people I speak to have  
**[1:14:49-1:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:14:49):**  never heard of Cobb and don't know what it is.  
**[1:14:52-1:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:14:52):**  So here's John Fordyce giving a definition and explaining some of the many advantages  
**[1:14:56-1:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:14:56):**  of this material.  
**[1:14:57-1:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:14:57):**  Cobb is a mixture of earth, sand, and straw with water, which is used to create a plastic  
**[1:15:07-1:15:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:15:07):**  earthen mixture that is then used to build walls.  
**[1:15:12-1:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:15:12):**  And the advantages of that is that it's a highly sustainable way of building and it  
**[1:15:21-1:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:15:21):**  uses locally sourced materials.  
**[1:15:26-1:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:15:26):**  The mixture is like adobe, but we don't make bricks.  
**[1:15:32-1:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:15:32):**  We just stack it up in layers on top of a foundation and a stem wall to create the walls.  
**[1:15:44-1:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:15:44):**  The layers, it's stacked up in layers and the layers are interpenetrated so that we  
**[1:15:52-1:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:15:52):**  actually achieve a monolithic construction rather than mortar bricks like adobe.  
**[1:15:59-1:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:15:59):**  And it's just done as a sequence of stacking up the layers, letting them dry, and then  
**[1:16:04-1:16:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:16:04):**  adding more layers as the building progresses in height.  
**[1:16:08-1:16:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:16:08):**  And as I mentioned, the wall is protected from ground moisture by a stem wall and a  
**[1:16:14-1:16:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:16:14):**  foundation and those are either concrete or stone, mortared stone or broken concrete urbanite.  
**[1:16:24-1:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:16:24):**  And then in the construction of the wall, there is originally did not include reinforcing  
**[1:16:33-1:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:16:33):**  that that was provided by the straw, but now for what we've been doing, we've actually  
**[1:16:39-1:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:16:39):**  included actual reinforcing in the wall because it's needed for structural, sorry, for seismic  
**[1:16:48-1:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:16:48):**  strength.  
**[1:16:50-1:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:16:50):**  And the rest of the building is basically standard construction that is in the roof  
**[1:16:55-1:17:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:16:55):**  is wood and all the other elements are basically standard.  
**[1:17:01-1:17:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:17:01):**  And the advantages of COB is that it's low cost, low material cost, got a low carbon  
**[1:17:08-1:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:17:08):**  footprint.  
**[1:17:10-1:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:17:10):**  The technique is very simple and it's really friendly to owner builders and that can remove  
**[1:17:17-1:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:17:17):**  with the owner builder, remove the labor costs, which can be as much as two thirds of the  
**[1:17:22-1:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:17:22):**  cost of a building.  
**[1:17:25-1:17:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:17:25):**  And the beauty, the beauties of it is that it allows non rectilinear designs.  
**[1:17:33-1:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:17:33):**  And for me personally, the, that this is a cure to what I call Cartesian madness, where  
**[1:17:43-1:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:17:43):**  we live in a world that is basically dominated by rectilinear construction and that affects  
**[1:17:49-1:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:17:49):**  our thinking and cultural habits.  
**[1:17:52-1:17:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:17:52):**  And so COB makes possible a change from that.  
**[1:17:58-1:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:17:58):**  So those are the advantages.  
**[1:18:01-1:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:18:01):**  Now though we covered a lot of ground in this interview, I was really keen to know how the  
**[1:18:04-1:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:18:04):**  information laid out in this new code proposal would change how the underground world of  
**[1:18:09-1:18:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:18:09):**  COB builders is currently operating and what some of the major focuses on quality and standardization  
**[1:18:14-1:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:18:14):**  would be.  
**[1:18:15-1:18:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:18:15):**  Anthony Dente told me about some of the most important safety considerations from his perspective  
**[1:18:20-1:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:18:20):**  as a structural engineer.  
**[1:18:22-1:18:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:18:22):**  The prevailing knowledge on COB building varies quite widely.  
**[1:18:30-1:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:18:30):**  In New Zealand, they have what we consider the most robust earthen building standards  
**[1:18:35-1:18:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:18:35):**  nationally recognized.  
**[1:18:37-1:18:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:18:37):**  They're also a seismically active country and English speaking, which is beneficial  
**[1:18:41-1:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:18:41):**  to us in the Western United States.  
**[1:18:44-1:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:18:44):**  There's also been an ASTM standard written on earthen wall construction, which was mostly  
**[1:18:51-1:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:18:51):**  followed a lot of the same guidelines as the New Zealand code.  
**[1:18:54-1:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:18:54):**  And then there are many, many, some permitted but mostly unpermitted structures across the  
**[1:19:02-1:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:19:02):**  Western United States and across the globe.  
**[1:19:08-1:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:19:08):**  Though I bring up all three of those because you will find every shape, size, format of  
**[1:19:17-1:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:19:17):**  wall lineup, of wall sizing, of window spacing.  
**[1:19:23-1:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:19:23):**  Having very large window cavities with very thin columns of straw only COB is not advisable.  
**[1:19:35-1:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:19:35):**  This is something that you do see in practice and that is a detail that the code and people  
**[1:19:46-1:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:19:46):**  with current knowledge of testing and of building standards with the material would highly recommend  
**[1:19:52-1:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:19:52):**  against in any environment, but especially in seismic environments and high wind environments.  
**[1:20:02-1:20:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:20:02):**  Foundations are another part of the structure that are often built not to current code standards.  
**[1:20:08-1:20:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:20:08):**  I believe there's a lot of potential for research on this topic of exploring ways to make moisture  
**[1:20:19-1:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:20:19):**  proof, environmentally sustaining foundation, isolating basis for COB structures.  
**[1:20:26-1:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:20:26):**  Though currently in the United States, the prevailing permittable foundation system is  
**[1:20:34-1:20:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:20:34):**  a concrete foundation system.  
**[1:20:36-1:20:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:20:36):**  We work closely with trying to intensely decrease carbon input into our concrete mixes here  
**[1:20:44-1:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:20:44):**  at our office.  
**[1:20:47-1:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:20:47):**  As you know, concrete can be quite carbon intensive.  
**[1:20:51-1:20:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:20:51):**  There's a number of other little bells and whistles, connections to roof diaphragms.  
**[1:20:57-1:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:20:57):**  How are you anchoring to the top of your wall?  
**[1:20:59-1:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:20:59):**  How is that connected to your roof rafters?  
**[1:21:03-1:21:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:21:03):**  Simple clips, just metal clips connecting those pieces together can add a continuity  
**[1:21:09-1:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:21:09):**  to the building that keeps one side of the building far more securely attached to the  
**[1:21:14-1:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:21:14):**  other side of the building and that can be really helpful, but not always done in practice.  
**[1:21:21-1:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:21:21):**  In the end, the most important takeaway for me was that getting new materials approved  
**[1:21:25-1:21:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:21:25):**  by the codes is a long and expensive process and in the end it comes down to a vote from  
**[1:21:29-1:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:21:29):**  people who care enough to see these traditional building techniques revived and valued once  
**[1:21:34-1:21:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:21:34):**  more.  
**[1:21:35-1:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:21:35):**  I would urge anyone listening who wants to see progress in the way we build in the US  
**[1:21:39-1:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:21:39):**  and around the world to visit the COB Research Institute's website and perhaps donate to  
**[1:21:43-1:21:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:21:43):**  the organization as funds are always needed to continue their campaigns and research.  
**[1:21:58-1:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:21:58):**  Now aside from all the interviews in this series, I've got a whole library of natural  
**[1:22:01-1:22:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:22:01):**  building interviews from previous seasons covering all kinds of other detailed explorations  
**[1:22:06-1:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:22:06):**  of materials like light straw clay, cob, bamboo, rammed earth, earth bags, and cordwood.  
**[1:22:12-1:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:22:12):**  I've also spoken to architects, plasterers, masons, and mad scientists, so be sure to  
**[1:22:17-1:22:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:22:17):**  check out the website for any other topics that you want to explore in depth.  
**[1:22:21-1:22:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:22:21):**  Before wrapping up this series, I want to cover some of the bigger questions and ideas  
**[1:22:25-1:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:22:25):**  that I've been wrestling with and that many of you listeners have reached out to me about  
**[1:22:29-1:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:22:29):**  too.  
**[1:22:30-1:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:22:30):**  I think we're at an amazing and terrifying time in human history where we have unparalleled  
**[1:22:35-1:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:22:35):**  access to resources and information around the globe.  
**[1:22:39-1:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:22:39):**  We're more informed and connected than ever before and we have access to more information  
**[1:22:44-1:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:22:44):**  than any time before now, but partly as a result of the technology that brought us these  
**[1:22:49-1:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:22:49):**  advantages we're also faced with tougher challenges than we've ever had to address before.  
**[1:22:55-1:22:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:22:55):**  The extent of the destruction that we've committed against the natural systems that we've relied  
**[1:22:59-1:23:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:22:59):**  on and exploited for so long and at such an alarming rate is catching up to us very fast  
**[1:23:05-1:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:23:05):**  and we increasingly see the effects of our disregard for the well-being of other lifeforms  
**[1:23:10-1:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:23:10):**  around us.  
**[1:23:11-1:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:23:11):**  We find ourselves at peak everything.  
**[1:23:14-1:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:23:14):**  Our rates of growth in human population are on the steep end of the exponential bell curve,  
**[1:23:19-1:23:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:23:19):**  while the decline of other species in the carrying capacity of our land is on the sharp  
**[1:23:23-1:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:23:23):**  end of the exponential decline.  
**[1:23:26-1:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:23:26):**  Without painting too grim of a picture or extrapolating about the effects of these and  
**[1:23:30-1:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:23:30):**  other opposing and unavoidable collisions, there are some very challenging questions  
**[1:23:34-1:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:23:34):**  that we're going to need to come to terms with before the decisions are made for us  
**[1:23:39-1:23:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:23:39):**  and our options for strategy dwindle into none.  
**[1:23:42-1:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:23:42):**  All of the growth and advancement of the last century seems to be riding on either the presumption  
**[1:23:47-1:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:23:47):**  that we can solve problems faster than when we can create them, or that the problems we  
**[1:23:51-1:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:23:51):**  create are justified by the narrow definition of progress as we define it for our own species.  
**[1:23:58-1:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:23:58):**  As I'm sure anyone listening to this would agree, unlimited growth on a finite planet  
**[1:24:03-1:24:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:24:03):**  is a contradiction and a temporary arrangement at best.  
**[1:24:07-1:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:24:07):**  The first question that I'll pose is, how can we as a global society operate on a model  
**[1:24:13-1:24:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:24:13):**  of degrowth?  
**[1:24:15-1:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:24:15):**  Is there any way to diminish in a healthy way?  
**[1:24:18-1:24:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:24:18):**  Can we scale down without collapse?  
**[1:24:22-1:24:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:24:22):**  As it pertains to this topic of regenerative and natural building, we face a projected  
**[1:24:26-1:24:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:24:26):**  population boom towards 10 billion people by the year 2050.  
**[1:24:30-1:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:24:30):**  Now that's only 30 years from now.  
**[1:24:33-1:24:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:24:33):**  That's only a little less time than I've been alive.  
**[1:24:37-1:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:24:37):**  Can things like design and building address these issues?  
**[1:24:41-1:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:24:41):**  Can natural building be adopted and scaled up to address the housing and infrastructure  
**[1:24:45-1:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:24:45):**  needs of a population of between 8 and 10 billion people?  
**[1:24:50-1:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:24:50):**  Would natural building be just as destructive of a force as industrial building if adopted  
**[1:24:54-1:24:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:24:54):**  at the same scale as the current building industry around the world?  
**[1:24:59-1:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:24:59):**  Obviously, this isn't just a challenge for housing and infrastructure.  
**[1:25:03-1:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:25:03):**  How do these issues apply to the food, healthcare, or water systems?  
**[1:25:07-1:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:25:07):**  I plan to explore these questions in depth in future interviews and series on this podcast,  
**[1:25:12-1:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:25:12):**  but in the meantime, I want to hear your take on this.  
**[1:25:15-1:25:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:25:15):**  Leave comments and feedback on the website or email me directly.  
**[1:25:19-1:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:25:19):**  I do my best to read all of them.  
**[1:25:21-1:25:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:25:21):**  If you know of any of the writings or other resources on these topics or better yet, people  
**[1:25:25-1:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:25:25):**  that you would recommend that I reach out to for interviews, you can send those suggestions  
**[1:25:29-1:25:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:25:29):**  on topics, people to interview questions, or even just drop a line to say hi.  
**[1:25:34-1:25:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:25:34):**  I love getting to know people who care about these things the way that I do, and it's a  
**[1:25:38-1:25:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:25:38):**  great way for all of us to know that we're not alone in these challenges.  
**[1:25:42-1:25:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:25:42):**  If you enjoy these special episodes, be sure to let me know.  
**[1:25:46-1:25:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:25:46):**  This is an experiment that I'm trying out here for the first time with the thought that  
**[1:25:50-1:25:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:25:50):**  at the end of a series on a particular topic, I'll create a summary episode like this one  
**[1:25:55-1:26:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:25:55):**  with key clips and main points from the interviews in the series that sort of distill the most  
**[1:26:00-1:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-natural-build-series-special-episode/#t=1:26:00):**  important information for people who don't want to go back and listen to hours of interviews

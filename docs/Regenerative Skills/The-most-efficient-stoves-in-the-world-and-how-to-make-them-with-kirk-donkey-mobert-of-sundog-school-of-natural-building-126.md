**[0:01:27-0:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:01:27):**  while the movement is still in its infancy and awareness around the importance of ethical  
**[0:01:31-0:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:01:31):**  business still has a long way to go.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:01:34):**  If you want to tap into a network of informed and motivated people with strong environmental  
**[0:01:38-0:01:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:01:38):**  and community ethics who vote with their purchases, then you've come to the right place.

**[0:02:34-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:02:34):**  In this continuation on the series of regenerative building and design, I checked in with a good  
**[0:02:38-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:02:38):**  friend of mine and a hero in the rocket stove and masonry heater sphere.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:02:42):**  Kirk Mobert, more commonly known as Donkey, is the founder of the Sundog School of Natural  
**[0:02:47-0:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:02:47):**  Building in Northern California and has literally been on and in the ground through the development  
**[0:02:52-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:02:52):**  and maturation of rocket stoves and all the innovations and advances over the last 20  
**[0:02:57-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:02:57):**  odd years.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:02:58):**  This session might be a little heady for people who are new to rocket and masonry stoves,  
**[0:03:02-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:03:02):**  but for anyone looking to start from the beginning, you can check out the link to the first interview  
**[0:03:06-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:03:06):**  that I recorded with Donkey back in the first season by typing either Donkey or Rocket Stoves  
**[0:03:11-0:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:03:11):**  into the search bar on our website or just clicking on the link in the show notes for  
**[0:03:15-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:03:15):**  this episode.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:03:16):**  In this episode, we nerd out on the inner workings of the simple engineering behind  
**[0:03:20-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:03:20):**  some of the most efficient cooking and heating machines ever made.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:03:23):**  Donkey and I talk in detail about the potential applications for cook stoves, home heating,  
**[0:03:28-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:03:28):**  and even ovens and water heaters that can be made from the same base that superheats  
**[0:03:32-0:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:03:32):**  wood or other biofuels into complete and clean combustion.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:03:37):**  We talk about some of the innovations that have come from tinkerers in the online forums  
**[0:03:41-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:03:41):**  around these topics, as well as how you can get started making mad scientist-type pyro  
**[0:03:45-0:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:03:45):**  experiments in your backyard with natural and recycled materials.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:03:50):**  We also go into detail about why the full journey of our energy and fuel sources needs  
**[0:03:54-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:03:54):**  to be taken into account when calculating the efficiency and thermal output of an appliance.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:03:59):**  Since we describe a lot of aspects of stoves that can be hard to visualize just through  
**[0:04:04-0:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:04:04):**  audio, I've included a lot of links to the images on the online forums that you can find  
**[0:04:08-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:04:08):**  in the show notes for this episode to make it easier to follow along.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:04:12):**  This was a really fun conversation, but I'll warn you listeners that the nerd factor, much  
**[0:04:17-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:04:17):**  like when I get talking about earthen plasters and design theory, is really high on this  
**[0:04:22-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:04:22):**  one.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:04:23):**  So get your pocket protectors and thick glasses out and I'll turn things over now to Donkey.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:04:28):**  Hey, Kirk.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:04:29):**  Donkey, my man.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:04:31):**  How are you doing, buddy?  
**[0:04:32-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:04:32):**  I'm great, Oliver.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:04:33):**  Long time, no talk.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:04:35):**  I know, far too long.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:04:37):**  It's really cool to catch up with you.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:04:38):**  I'm glad to hear things are going so well at your place up in Northern California and  
**[0:04:42-0:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:04:42):**  that you've got so much work doing small cobb cottages and ovens and rocket stoves and all  
**[0:04:48-0:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:04:48):**  that fun stuff that you're known for.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:04:50):**  Thank you.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:04:51):**  Well, so I really am hoping to get kind of a more updated version of the conversation  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:04:57):**  that we had previously, kind of going into depth about rocket stoves, where that technology  
**[0:05:02-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:05:02):**  is at, but we're also going to explore a little bit more about the options that people have  
**[0:05:06-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:05:06):**  for these types of installations in their home and also how to compare them to different  
**[0:05:11-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:05:11):**  types of stoves and fuel sources and all that.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:05:14):**  So what do you say we just jump right in?  
**[0:05:16-0:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:05:16):**  All righty then.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:05:17):**  Excellent.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:05:18):**  So like I mentioned, we recorded an episode earlier before.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:05:21):**  So if anybody wants to get to know about your background and how you got into natural building,  
**[0:05:25-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:05:25):**  I'm going to leave a link to that episode in the show notes for this podcast so they  
**[0:05:29-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:05:29):**  can go and check that out and we'll jump ahead.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:05:32):**  So let's start by talking about some of the innovations in rocket stove technology and  
**[0:05:37-0:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:05:37):**  what have been some of the changes that you've seen in the last couple of years?  
**[0:05:43-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:05:43):**  Oh boy.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:05:44):**  Well, you know, the batch rocket, the batch box rocket stove is really coming into its  
**[0:05:52-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:05:52):**  own now.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:05:53):**  Talk a little bit about that from the basics.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:05:56):**  For anybody who hasn't heard that term or know exactly what you're referring to, can  
**[0:06:00-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:06:00):**  you kind of describe it for us?  
**[0:06:01-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:06:01):**  Sure, sure.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:06:03):**  You know how most of the rocket stoves that we're usually familiar with, you see a lot  
**[0:06:07-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:06:07):**  of, I mean, well, there's really now three major branches of rocket stove and it's all  
**[0:06:12-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:06:12):**  about the feed.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:06:15):**  There's the horizontal feed.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:06:16):**  That's the oldest one that you see on cook stoves where you feed horizontally into the  
**[0:06:21-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:06:21):**  stove and the feed is the same diameter all the way through the feed and the heat riser  
**[0:06:27-0:06:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:06:27):**  and all that.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:06:29):**  That's the old Winnie Arsky rocket stove.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:06:35):**  And then you have the J tube rocket stove, which is moving into the rocket mass heaters  
**[0:06:40-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:06:40):**  realm where you put the wood down in it and then it burns horizontally, you know, and  
**[0:06:48-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:06:48):**  then before it goes to the heat riser.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:06:50):**  And again, that rocket stove, it's the same diameter all the way through, you know, the  
**[0:06:56-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:06:56):**  feed is the same diameter as the little horizontal burn tunnel part is the same diameter as the  
**[0:07:01-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:07:01):**  heat riser is the same diameter as the chimney pipe.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:07:06):**  And then you have about the batch rocket, which is completely different in a way.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:07:12):**  It's sort of a return to the horizontal feed, but with a much larger firebox.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:07:20):**  It's like a real firebox where you can put in much more wood at a time.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:07:27):**  So batch rocket is about four times the diameter of the chimney and the heat riser.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:07:38):**  What are some of the advantages of those different configurations?  
**[0:07:41-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:07:41):**  What have you found either makes it easier to run or like, yeah, how does that shake  
**[0:07:48-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:07:48):**  out?  
**[0:07:49-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:07:49):**  Well, let's see.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:07:50):**  The old horizontal ones were really meant for cooking and they were designed to be operated  
**[0:07:58-0:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:07:58):**  in places where there wasn't a lot of firewood available.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:08:01):**  And so you needed to be very, very, very conservative with the wood.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:08:05):**  So you have to physically push the wood into the fire consistently.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:08:11):**  You have to be there and alert and awake and constantly feeding in the wood.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:08:15):**  And if you don't do that, then it'll go kind of go out on its own, which means that you  
**[0:08:22-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:08:22):**  save on your stick.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:08:23):**  Right?  
**[0:08:24-0:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:08:24):**  Sure.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:08:25):**  It's efficient for fuel in that way.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:08:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:08:27):**  Well, it's efficient for fuel, but it's also, I mean, you know, all these stoves are really  
**[0:08:31-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:08:31):**  efficient for fuel.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:08:33):**  And I think that the J tube is actually a more consistent, efficient burn than the L  
**[0:08:39-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:08:39):**  tube.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:08:40):**  We'll call the L tube the horizontal feed.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:08:42):**  It's just that the L tube horizontal feed, if you don't shove the wood in on purpose,  
**[0:08:50-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:08:50):**  it will not burn it.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:08:51):**  It'll sort of just kind of go out where with the J tube, if you walk away from it, if you  
**[0:08:56-0:09:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:08:56):**  leave it alone, the wood will feed itself down until it's gone.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:09:02):**  For the most part is assuming it doesn't get blocked or kind of jammed in there.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:09:06):**  Right.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:09:07):**  Exactly.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:09:08):**  Assuming it doesn't block or jam up.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:09:09):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:09:10):**  Which happens, you know, nature does its thing.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:09:12):**  Definitely in my experience.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:09:13):**  And I've always preferred the J tube.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:09:15):**  That's kind of what I've taught in my own courses because like a minimal amount of maintenance  
**[0:09:20-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:09:20):**  means you can be paying more attention to either what you're cooking up on top or, you  
**[0:09:25-0:09:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:09:25):**  know, just not have to watch it so much.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:09:27):**  Right.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:09:28):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:09:29):**  Well, you know, the J tube has to be taller.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:09:31):**  Like it has to have a taller heat riser, which means that it's better geared for people who  
**[0:09:37-0:09:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:09:37):**  stand at the fire, who stands to cook.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:09:42):**  Well, it's that's not culturally culturally appropriate in a lot of places in the world  
**[0:09:47-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:09:47):**  where the people squat or sit to cook.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:09:50):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:09:51):**  I mean, one of the challenges I ran into is in the small indigenous village in Guatemala  
**[0:09:58-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:09:58):**  that I was living in, a lot of the women who primarily did the cooking in the house were  
**[0:10:04-0:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:10:04):**  under five feet tall, not uncommonly.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:10:07):**  And to have that higher heat riser made it somewhat uncomfortable for them to use a stove  
**[0:10:11-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:10:11):**  at that height.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:10:12):**  And I was constantly trying to put the, the J portion, the burn chamber down deeper into  
**[0:10:18-0:10:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:10:18):**  the earth, which, you know, has some advantages, but goodness, if, if any moisture rises up,  
**[0:10:24-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:10:24):**  it could flood at the bottom.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:10:26):**  That's yeah, that's right.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:10:27):**  Yeah, that's right.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:10:28):**  But, you know, I mean, the proportions can be messed with a little bit.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:10:32):**  I know that there's an ideal proportion, but there's a little bit of wiggle room.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:10:36):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:10:37):**  I often ended up shortening it a little bit for convenience.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:10:39):**  Right.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:10:40):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:10:41):**  So, I mean, so, so one of the other things about the L tube is, is that, that features  
**[0:10:45-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:10:45):**  that you can sit or squat at the fire.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:10:49):**  And it's culturally appropriate for, for people who do that.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:10:52):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:10:53):**  Whereas the J tube is very difficult as you pointed out, it's difficult for some short  
**[0:10:56-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:10:56):**  people to deal with.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:10:59):**  You know, let alone sit or squat at the fire to deal with, you know, to, to, to work with  
**[0:11:03-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:03):**  it.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:04):**  Mm hmm.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:05):**  So that's that, that's more of a cultural thing I think.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:08):**  Um, and a way of saving on wood.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:11):**  I mean, you know, granted you could pull the firewood out of a J tube to save it if you  
**[0:11:16-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:16):**  want to.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:17):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:18):**  But, but again, you know, you have to be conscious.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:20):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:21):**  So I got a little more maintenance.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:23):**  It's a bit more of an involved process.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:25):**  Exactly.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:26):**  Well, I don't know.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:27):**  Both of them are, you have to be conscious with both of them.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:29):**  You have to be conscious pushing the wood into the one and you have to be conscious  
**[0:11:32-0:11:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:32):**  taking the wood out of the other one.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:34):**  And I guess it's all relative to, it depends on what you're comparing it to.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:37):**  So if it's like an open fire that you're used to tending a lot, it's not that big of a difference.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:41):**  But if you're used to just pressing a knob and throttling a gas flame or even just, you  
**[0:11:48-0:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:48):**  know, like a resistor and electrical resistor, all right, then it's a different comparison.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:53):**  Yeah, true enough.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:54):**  True enough.  
**[0:11:55-0:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:55):**  Okay.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:56):**  So moving along, we got the, the, the J tube now, which we've kind of talked about.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:12:01):**  J tubes are nice in that you can stand at them and feed down, you know, because, because  
**[0:12:07-0:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:12:07):**  I come from a culture that stands to cook.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:12:10):**  Yeah.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:12:11):**  Um, if I, I, you know, I've built, um, stand up stoves that use the, the L tube feed and  
**[0:12:18-0:12:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:12:18):**  it's quite a pain actually because you're, you have to constantly get down on your hands  
**[0:12:22-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:12:22):**  and knees to look horizontally to stuff wood into the box.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:12:26):**  Sure.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:12:27):**  So you're up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down, you know, and it's, it's not that great.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:12:31):**  So standing at a J tube, um, rocket mass heater, I mean, sorry, rocket cooker is much easier  
**[0:12:38-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:12:38):**  because you can basically just reach down and twiddle the wood.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:12:41):**  It's not a horizontal, you know, it's not a horizontal twiddle box.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:12:46):**  It's a vertical one.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:12:48):**  Sure.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:12:49):**  Um, the vertical feed also tends to hold the wood in a better position for combustion all  
**[0:12:56-0:13:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:12:56):**  the time, you know, because it's falling down.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:13:00):**  Ideally it's falling down to the bottom of the firebox where the combustion's happening  
**[0:13:05-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:13:05):**  and ideally it tends to sort of do that.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:13:08):**  Sure.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:13:09):**  I mean, of course it doesn't always, you know, a little bit of fluff or branches sticking  
**[0:13:17-0:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:13:17):**  out or just the friction inside the box.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:13:21):**  They'll, they'll hang up if you're not paying attention and then the bottom of the sticks  
**[0:13:25-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:13:25):**  will burn off and then the top of the stick now on fire will roll out of the firebox.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:13:31):**  Yeah, potentially.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:13:33):**  Or, um, depending on the draw to, in my experience, the fire might start coming up some of the  
**[0:13:38-0:13:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:13:38):**  longer sticks and reverse the flow or start burning outside of the chamber.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:13:43):**  It was supposed to.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:13:45):**  And then I guess the other one that I, every once in a while would struggle with is depending  
**[0:13:49-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:13:49):**  on how those sticks would fall as the bottom's burned out, it could choke off the fire by  
**[0:13:55-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:13:55):**  blocking the air intake.  
**[0:13:56-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:13:56):**  Yup.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:13:57):**  Uh, there's a little thing called a Peter channel, a P channel.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:01):**  Uh, it's a metal plate that you can build that goes against the front brick or the back  
**[0:14:07-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:07):**  brick, I guess the brick away from you.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:09):**  Agreed.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:10):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:11):**  Those can be super useful.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:12):**  And there's like that variation on the L configuration too, that keeps the airflow underneath going  
**[0:14:16-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:16):**  as well.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:17):**  Yup.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:18):**  That's right.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:19):**  Yup.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:20):**  Those are super useful.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:21):**  I would recommend if anybody's building those configurations to, to make the little extra  
**[0:14:24-0:14:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:24):**  effort and put that metal thing in there.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:27):**  Well that, I mean the metal thing avoids, um, it's, it's great for three things really.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:31):**  I choke.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:32):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:33):**  Did we talk about this in the last go?  
**[0:14:34-0:14:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:34):**  I don't think we covered the P channel.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:35):**  Okay.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:36):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:37):**  I don't really remember that we did.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:38):**  Um, it's worth mentioning though.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:40):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:41):**  Well it's just a little metal plate and it's, um, it's about 5% of the, of the cross sectional  
**[0:14:48-0:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:48):**  area of the whole system.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:49):**  Um, and what it does is it creates, well actually no, let me rephrase that.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:54):**  It creates an air channel that's 5% of the cross sectional area of the rest of the system.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:59):**  Yeah.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:15:00):**  Um, and a fresh air that then can be sort of injected in front downstream from where  
**[0:15:07-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:15:07):**  the wood is.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:15:08):**  Yup.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:15:09):**  Uh, and it keeps that first brick really much cooler so it's less likely to crack.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:15:14):**  Um, and it sort of prevents the, what you were talking about, wood from falling into  
**[0:15:20-0:15:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:15:20):**  that space and just completely choking with fire.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:15:24):**  Um, and it also creates a consistent steady stream of cool air, uh, and just downstream  
**[0:15:32-0:15:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:15:32):**  where you want it really.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:15:34):**  Mm hmm.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:15:35):**  Um, so it's, it's really good for organizing the fire and it goes hand in hand with another  
**[0:15:41-0:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:15:41):**  thing called a trip wire.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:15:43):**  Now this one I have been reading about, I've seen all the pictures and the instructions  
**[0:15:47-0:15:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:15:47):**  on the forums that you host, but I haven't had a chance to try it out myself.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:15:51):**  Can you explain it a little?  
**[0:15:53-0:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:15:53):**  Yeah.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:15:54):**  Uh, you may have experienced this with regular J tube, you know, where you put the wood in  
**[0:15:58-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:15:58):**  and it'll do something that I call seeking where the flame will run down the firebox  
**[0:16:05-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:16:05):**  really far and you'll even see it sometimes pop out of the heat riser for a second and  
**[0:16:12-0:16:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:16:12):**  then it'll run back again and then it'll run out and run back.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:16:16):**  It'll sort of pulse, right?  
**[0:16:19-0:16:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:16:19):**  You may have seen that pulsing and every time the fire does that pulsing maneuver, when  
**[0:16:26-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:16:26):**  it returns, it'll puff a little puff of smoke.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:16:30):**  So if you were to check its efficiency curve while it's pulsing, you'll see high efficiency  
**[0:16:35-0:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:16:35):**  and then suddenly this low efficiency moment and then back to high efficiency again and  
**[0:16:39-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:16:39):**  back to low efficiency, et cetera.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:16:42):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:16:43):**  And it's a sign that there's an airflow problem, but, um, even when the air is going fine and  
**[0:16:51-0:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:16:51):**  everything's arranged just right, you can still see that flame sort of pulse in and  
**[0:16:55-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:16:55):**  out.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:16:56):**  Um, and quite often you'll see that flame running up the heat riser, uh, and it'll be  
**[0:17:02-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:17:02):**  a little more disorganized.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:17:04):**  So a, um, a trip wire does is it's, it can be made a lot of different ways, but typically  
**[0:17:11-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:17:11):**  it's a brick with sort of an arrow shape cut into it.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:17:16):**  And the arrow shape has what we call a bluff body on it.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:17:20):**  Um, and this brick is placed at the very top of the horizontal burn chamber.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:17:24):**  So it's down.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:17:27):**  And this is closer towards the fuel source or closer towards the heat riser?  
**[0:17:32-0:17:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:17:32):**  It's kind of in the middle.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:17:34):**  I would say, you know, uh, most of my, um, horizontal, most of my burn tunnels are about  
**[0:17:41-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:17:41):**  four bricks deep.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:17:42):**  Okay.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:17:43):**  Okay.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:17:44):**  So I guess it's actually closer to the fuel source because it's the second brick typically.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:17:48):**  Gotcha.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:17:49):**  Gotcha.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:17:50):**  And so visually looking at it, it's, it's like a slanted arrow pointing downstream of  
**[0:17:55-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:17:55):**  where the fire is going, right?  
**[0:17:57-0:17:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:17:57):**  Right.  
**[0:17:58-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:17:58):**  That's right.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:17:59):**  And it's a slanted arrow.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:18:00):**  So it makes a little bluff.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:18:01):**  It's like a little projection from the ceiling.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:18:03):**  Yep.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:18:04):**  Um, and that little projection creates turbulence.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:18:09):**  And so what that turbulence does is it mixes the fuel air better because you know, the,  
**[0:18:13-0:18:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:18:13):**  the unburned fuel, the hot unburned fuel tends to rise to the top of that, of that tunnel.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:18:20):**  Uh, and so this, um, little heat, uh, this little, uh, trip wire will spin that stuff  
**[0:18:26-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:18:26):**  up really well.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:18:27):**  So you'll get a really good fuel air mixture there.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:18:31):**  But what it also does is it creates sort of a flame holder.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:18:35):**  Um, are you familiar with the term flame holder?  
**[0:18:38-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:18:38):**  No, no.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:18:39):**  Catch me up to speed.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:18:40):**  Well, a lot of stoves like propane stoves, any stove that burns a gas, right?  
**[0:18:44-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:18:44):**  Um, they'll have something called a flame holder in it.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:18:48):**  And quite often it's just the, the aperture.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:18:50):**  It's just the holes in your, in your stove top.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:18:53):**  Um, they create a turbulence and that turbulence is consistent.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:18:57):**  It stays in one spot so that when the gas comes up and mixes with air, the flame is  
**[0:19:02-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:19:02):**  always in one spot.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:19:06):**  Otherwise the flame will, yeah, it'll, it'll be a regular, it'll seek around and they can  
**[0:19:11-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:19:11):**  put itself out like in a propane stove.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:19:14):**  Sure.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:19:15):**  Um, so this creates a flame holder inside the rocket stove itself in the burn tunnel  
**[0:19:20-0:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:19:20):**  so that then the flame stopped seeking.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:19:23):**  It's always in a consistent spot.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:19:26):**  Um, and it has more time to burn itself completely and run the fire out.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:19:31):**  And quite often you won't even see flames in the heat riser at all.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:19:36):**  The fuel will be completely burned, um, before it even gets to the riser.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:19:40):**  Gotcha.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:19:41):**  And so is this, are any of these techniques something that can be integrated in with the  
**[0:19:47-0:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:19:47):**  batch box?  
**[0:19:48-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:19:48):**  Because all the configurations that I've seen are even simpler than what we've described  
**[0:19:53-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:19:53):**  here.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:19:54):**  So you're trying to break it down from the beginning for the batch box?  
**[0:19:57-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:19:57):**  Batch boxes have all of those features in them.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:19:59):**  They just look a little different.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:20:01):**  Okay.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:20:02):**  So what a batch box is, is, is, is as I said before, it's a much larger feed box so you  
**[0:20:09-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:20:09):**  could stick in a whole batch of wood.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:20:11):**  It's like a, like a regular wood stove.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:20:13):**  Kind of.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:20:14):**  You put a front door on it, you open the door, you start your fire, you put the wood in,  
**[0:20:18-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:20:18):**  you close the door and it burns about four times as much at one given moment as, um,  
**[0:20:26-0:20:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:20:26):**  as a J-Tube will.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:20:29):**  You can burn, um, what's it called?  
**[0:20:31-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:20:31):**  You can burn cordwood in it.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:20:33):**  You can put regular cordwood firewood instead of having to chop up your firewood.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:20:37):**  Well, depending on where you live, of course.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:20:39):**  Right.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:20:40):**  Right.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:20:41):**  And that's actually why I first started to experiment with them is because when I was  
**[0:20:44-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:20:44):**  building these stoves for the Guatemalan women in my town, their biggest complaint was that  
**[0:20:50-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:20:50):**  they had to cut all this kindling to put into the J configuration and they didn't want the  
**[0:20:55-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:20:55):**  extra chore.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:20:56):**  So they wanted to be able to, to put in cordwood or larger diameter wood and not have to break  
**[0:21:00-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:00):**  it down.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:01):**  Right.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:02):**  Well, if you're cutting down huge trees or you know, trees in order to make firewood,  
**[0:21:08-0:21:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:08):**  that's an advantage.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:09):**  Sure.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:10):**  This is assuming you have a better fuel source than what these were originally designed to,  
**[0:21:13-0:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:13):**  to solve.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:14):**  Right.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:15):**  I mean, if you're going out and you're basically harvesting stick wood, it's not necessarily  
**[0:21:18-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:18):**  an advantage.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:19):**  Sure.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:20):**  Well, anyway, um, most of the folks that I know, you know, I live in these, in the States  
**[0:21:25-0:21:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:25):**  and here it's all about cut down big trees and cordwood is ubiquitous, at least in the,  
**[0:21:32-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:32):**  out here in the country.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:33):**  It's ubiquitous.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:34):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:35):**  It's being banned in most cities now I believe.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:37):**  Huh.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:38):**  Okay.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:40):**  Like San Francisco.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:41):**  They're starting to ban straight up ban wood fires.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:44):**  I mean, it makes sense for the emissions within a city, but anyway,  
**[0:21:49-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:49):**  Only, only if you don't have efficient stoves.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:52):**  Sure.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:53):**  Sure.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:54):**  But mostly the idea that this technology is this simple and exists.  
**[0:21:57-0:21:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:57):**  Right.  
**[0:21:58-0:21:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:58):**  Right.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:59):**  Exactly.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:22:00):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:22:01):**  Let's see.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:22:02):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:22:03):**  And that just runs into this whole political thing that I don't even want to get in.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:22:04):**  We'll do a whole nother episode on that.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:22:07):**  So anyway, um, so a batch rocket means you can put cordwood in it.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:22:11):**  And you can put more in at one time.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:22:14):**  Um, but in order to do that and have it run efficiently, it will, there's still a heat  
**[0:22:20-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:22:20):**  riser in the back.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:22:23):**  You have to inject air towards the back of the firebox.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:22:27):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:22:28):**  Uh, and that there is actually a P channel.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:22:30):**  Gotcha.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:22:31):**  It's a slightly different configuration.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:22:34):**  It comes from a different place.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:22:36):**  Basically there's a pipe that goes in that injects the air and then it has to be shaped  
**[0:22:42-0:22:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:22:42):**  a certain way so that, so that gas is flowing over it will draw air in, but it's essentially  
**[0:22:48-0:22:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:22:48):**  the same device.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:22:50):**  Right.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:22:51):**  Um, okay.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:22:52):**  So then you have your batch rocket, your batch box feed part where the wood goes.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:22:58):**  Now that's four times system size.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:23:01):**  Uh, have we defined system size yet?  
**[0:23:05-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:23:05):**  I don't think so.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:23:06):**  Let's go on up a bit.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:23:07):**  Yeah, take it back a little bit.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:23:09):**  And actually, how about this?  
**[0:23:11-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:23:11):**  Before we get too much into the details of how these things are configured, quickly tell  
**[0:23:15-0:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:23:15):**  us where I can, uh, send people to see images of this.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:23:19):**  Cause I know it's going to help with understanding what you're talking about when nerds like  
**[0:23:23-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:23:23):**  me haven't spent so much time on your forums and have this all in their head.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:23:27):**  Okay.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:23:28):**  Well there's a, there's, if you want batch rocket knowledge, you really want to go to  
**[0:23:33-0:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:23:33):**  batch rocket dot EU EU.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:23:35):**  Is that right?  
**[0:23:38-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:23:38):**  Yeah, I think it's batch rocket dot EU.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:23:39):**  Well, you know what, I'll make sure I'll get all the links of this.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:23:42):**  I'll put them on the show notes for this podcast along with your previous episode if people  
**[0:23:46-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:23:46):**  want to go look back.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:23:47):**  And if any of you are struggling to follow along with this and need some visual cues,  
**[0:23:52-0:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:23:52):**  just check out the links on the website and follow along from there.  
**[0:23:55-0:23:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:23:55):**  Yep.  
**[0:23:56-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:23:56):**  Yep.  
**[0:23:57-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:23:57):**  Yep.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:23:58):**  Uh, having said that, it is, it's batch rocket B A T C H R O C K E T dot EU.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:02):**  My man.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:03):**  Um, all right.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:04):**  And that is, um, um, um, Peter Vandenberg site and he lays it all out, man.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:11):**  He just gives away the keys to the kingdom.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:14):**  It's a really good site.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:15):**  It's all fair.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:16):**  He's on point.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:17):**  Oh yeah.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:18):**  He's a, he's, he's a genius.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:19):**  I love that guy.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:21):**  He's also a lot of fun to hang out with.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:22):**  I'll tell you what.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:24):**  Nice.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:25):**  Um, and then, uh, you could also go to my forums, uh, at a donkey 32 dot pro boards  
**[0:24:31-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:31):**  dot com.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:32):**  Uh, the whole thing is there.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:35):**  And also the journey is there, you know, because, um, Peter did all of his testing and reported  
**[0:24:41-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:41):**  every single iteration that he did on the forums.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:45):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:46):**  No, you can go way down the rabbit hole if you love this stuff as much as we do.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:49):**  Yeah, totally, totally, totally.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:50):**  I mean, you can learn not only how to build them, but how all the iterations that didn't  
**[0:24:55-0:24:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:55):**  work plus why he was thinking what he was thinking when he did those iterations.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:59):**  So yeah, if you're super nerdy into this stuff, that might be fun, but you don't have to know  
**[0:25:05-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:25:05):**  all that stuff.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:25:06):**  That's the point.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:25:07):**  Yeah, right.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:25:08):**  If you're not, then it's going to be tedious, but right.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:25:09):**  So let's stick with the basic explanation for now.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:25:13):**  Okay.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:25:14):**  So, so then you got your feed box, uh, and then you have this air injector in the back  
**[0:25:18-0:25:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:25:18):**  and right behind the air injector, the whole thing, Oh wait, Nope.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:25:23):**  I'm sorry.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:25:24):**  I'm sorry.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:25:25):**  I did not talk about, uh, system size.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:25:28):**  Yep.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:25:29):**  Okay.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:25:30):**  So system size is based on, well, back in the day, it was based on what stove pipe you  
**[0:25:34-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:25:34):**  could find.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:25:36):**  Um, we would go to the dump and we'd pull out a bunch of junk stove pipe.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:25:41):**  And then you look at the stove pipe and go, Oh, what have I got here?  
**[0:25:43-0:25:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:25:43):**  I got a bunch of six inch stove pipe.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:25:46):**  And now rocket stoves traditionally need to be built so that the feed and the heat riser  
**[0:25:51-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:25:51):**  and all that stuff and all the tubing through a bench or whatever you're doing has to be  
**[0:25:56-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:25:56):**  the same.  
**[0:25:57-0:25:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:25:57):**  It can never be smaller than system size.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:25:59):**  This is all classical stuff.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:26:01):**  And so we would match it to the stove pipe we had.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:26:04):**  Right.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:26:05):**  So if I got a bunch of six inch stove pipe, well, I'm going to make a six inch rocket  
**[0:26:09-0:26:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:26:09):**  stuff.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:26:10):**  Sure.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:26:11):**  Okay.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:26:12):**  So, I mean, that kind of covers that quickly.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:26:14):**  Sure.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:26:15):**  Um, uh, so what a batch rocket does interestingly enough is that, okay, so you have your four  
**[0:26:20-0:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:26:20):**  times system size as your feed box, and then it narrows to 0.72% of system size at a place  
**[0:26:30-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:26:30):**  that we call the throat, which is the very back of the feed.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:26:34):**  Um, and then after the side, sometimes after the side, true.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:26:39):**  The others, the sidewinder batch rocket, which has a, um, a side throat.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:26:43):**  And then Peter Vandenberg has been playing around with his, um, his double shoebox idea,  
**[0:26:49-0:26:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:26:49):**  uh, which I say is not a rocket stove incidentally.  
**[0:26:55-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:26:55):**  Um, but, uh, it's still an amazing thing and he has a throat.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:26:59):**  It's actually vertical, it's above in the, above the firebox.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:27:04):**  Okay.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:27:05):**  Um, I, um, I'm saying that it's not a true rocket stove and Peter agrees with me, but  
**[0:27:12-0:27:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:27:12):**  it's really cool thing.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:27:13):**  It's called a double shoebox.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:27:14):**  It's on the forums.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:27:15):**  Go check it out.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:27:16):**  Nice.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:27:17):**  I'll have to check it out.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:27:18):**  Yeah, it's pretty nifty.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:27:20):**  Um, I think what they've done though is they've made a double shoebox that is a true rocket  
**[0:27:26-0:27:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:27:26):**  stove and I haven't actually gotten into it deep enough to see, but I can tell there is  
**[0:27:31-0:27:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:27:31):**  a heat riser on it some kind of way.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:27:34):**  Anyway, let's get off of that.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:27:36):**  Okay.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:27:37):**  So in the back of the batch rocket, there's a throat, uh, and that throat does exactly  
**[0:27:43-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:27:43):**  the same thing that, um, the tripwire does.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:27:48):**  Because it's a tall, narrow slot, um, gases and air have to kind of squeeze through it.  
**[0:27:57-0:27:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:27:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:27:58):**  It's compressing it and causing that turbulence like the tripwire you're talking about.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:28:02):**  Exactly.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:28:03):**  That's right.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:28:04):**  It's a, it's like a venturi tube basically creates a venturi effect.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:28:07):**  Nice.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:28:08):**  Um, and yeah, the air comes swirling out on both sides into the riser, right?  
**[0:28:14-0:28:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:28:14):**  Right.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:28:15):**  That's right.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:28:16):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:28:17):**  And then you have something called a double Rams horn.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:28:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:28:20):**  I saw that when I built this one at my own house, I didn't end up keeping the thing almost  
**[0:28:24-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:28:24):**  because it ended up firing too hot.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:28:27):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:28:28):**  I just end up scalding everything that I put on that.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:28:31):**  And I think if I go back in my, my videos, I've got a clip of us trying to use it as  
**[0:28:37-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:28:37):**  a barbecue and nearly like melting our cast iron pan.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:28:42):**  It's too much.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:28:43):**  It's entirely too much.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:28:45):**  Yeah, it's too much.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:28:48):**  But you could build a tiny little four inch batch rocket, you know, a four inch system  
**[0:28:53-0:28:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:28:53):**  size batch rocket, which is also a little too much for just cooking.  
**[0:28:58-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:28:58):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:28:59):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:29:00):**  But a little tiny four inch batch rocket with a tiny little firebox can heat up remarkably  
**[0:29:04-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:29:04):**  large space.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:29:06):**  Sure.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:29:07):**  That's the thing.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:29:08):**  So like after we talk about these, uh, configurations of the burn chambers, then we can go into  
**[0:29:14-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:29:14):**  all of the different iterations of how to use the heat and how to reclaim it and how  
**[0:29:18-0:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:29:18):**  to reroute it in different ways.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:29:21):**  Let's wrap up on the, the batch box at the bottom, and then we can talk about that whole  
**[0:29:25-0:29:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:29:25):**  world.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:29:26):**  I kind of think we just did that.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:29:28):**  Um, uh, the, the one thing that note, I guess is that batch rocket heat risers tend to be  
**[0:29:33-0:29:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:29:33):**  a little taller than usual.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:29:35):**  Uh, do you have off the top of your head, the, the ratios on that?  
**[0:29:40-0:29:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:29:40):**  Oh boy.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:29:41):**  Uh, yeah, I'm going to get that wrong.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:29:44):**  Um, I'm, I'm probably going to get forums are for, we don't have to go too nerdy on  
**[0:29:48-0:29:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:29:48):**  the episode.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:29:49):**  Yeah, totally.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:29:51):**  And I've seen you do some really cool stuff with this in finding household items to build  
**[0:29:56-0:30:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:29:56):**  this out of, because you know, some people will go way far into this and you know, get  
**[0:30:01-0:30:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:30:01):**  all of the proper insulative material, the firebrick welded doors, and you know, that  
**[0:30:07-0:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:30:07):**  can be difficult for people to acquire or find something with the skill set to put together.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:30:12):**  I've seen you do stuff like using a pot and pan lids that are glass as the, as the door  
**[0:30:19-0:30:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:30:19):**  for one of these chambers.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:30:20):**  What are some of the other materials that you've been able to play around with?  
**[0:30:24-0:30:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:30:24):**  Uh, well, you know, because everybody else is going high tech, I just figured that I  
**[0:30:28-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:30:28):**  don't need to go that way.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:30:29):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:30:30):**  So, um, I've been building, um, uh, uh, homemade, uh, moldable refractory materials out of,  
**[0:30:38-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:30:38):**  uh, uh, clay, rich dirt and wood, ash and cow manure and, um, and crushed up pottery  
**[0:30:45-0:30:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:30:45):**  called grog.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:30:47):**  Um, I have been using found objects to create, uh, like heat radiators.  
**[0:30:54-0:31:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:30:54):**  Um, as you said, Pyrex lids are great little past doors.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:31:00):**  You could actually see the fire, which is one of the great things about, about that  
**[0:31:05-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:31:05):**  part blows people's minds when they start to see fires burning sideways or backwards.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:31:11):**  And that's really where I get it with the, with the students where they get that wow  
**[0:31:15-0:31:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:31:15):**  factor.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:31:16):**  Well, right.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:31:17):**  I mean, that's when, that's when my propeller really starts spinning, you know, and that's  
**[0:31:20-0:31:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:31:20):**  what got me attracted to all the stuff for the first place is cause I've always been  
**[0:31:23-0:31:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:31:23):**  a little bit of a pyro, you know, but once you see a fire doing something that intuitively  
**[0:31:29-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:31:29):**  is all kinds of wrong and yet is doing it, you know, you just go, wow.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:31:35):**  Yeah.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:31:36):**  Um, anyway, so I also take apart physics.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:31:39):**  Yeah, yeah, totally.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:31:40):**  I also take apart like old stove bodies and I use the old cast iron stove tops, you know,  
**[0:31:46-0:31:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:31:46):**  with the removable plates.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:31:47):**  So what's the main thing that people should be thinking about if they're trying out found  
**[0:31:51-0:31:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:31:51):**  or alternative or natural, uh, alternatives to like purchased items, especially when it  
**[0:31:58-0:32:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:31:58):**  comes to enduring the type of heat that we're putting in here?  
**[0:32:01-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:32:01):**  Oh yeah.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:32:02):**  Well the number one thing to think about is the, you know, like don't build it in your  
**[0:32:07-0:32:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:32:07):**  house first.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:32:10):**  Go outside.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:32:11):**  You know, it goes without saying, but yes, one would think, but it's pretty surprising  
**[0:32:16-0:32:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:32:16):**  how many people will make their first build a batch rocket really complicated thing because  
**[0:32:21-0:32:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:32:21):**  the batch rockets are not easy to build compared to like a J tube.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:32:26):**  Sure.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:32:27):**  Sure.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:32:28):**  It's like a, and you got to get it just right or it doesn't burn quite right.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:32:31):**  But anyway, you know, I've seen guys that will guys and gals that will go and say, well,  
**[0:32:36-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:32:36):**  I really want a batch rocket because of all these things and no, I've never built a stove  
**[0:32:39-0:32:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:32:39):**  before in my life.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:32:42):**  And uh, I'm going to throw these 10 experiments into,  
**[0:32:45-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:32:45):**  Oh, I'm going to build it in my house.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:32:49):**  Oh boy.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:32:50):**  Yeah.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:32:51):**  Right.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:32:52):**  The recipe for disaster there.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:32:53):**  And well, surprisingly nobody's died yet and nobody's house is burned down yet that I know  
**[0:32:57-0:32:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:32:57):**  of.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:32:58):**  Let's not have anybody listening to this be the first one.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:33:00):**  Let's keep that statistic where it is.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:33:02):**  Right?  
**[0:33:03-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:33:03):**  Exactly.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:33:04):**  So, so the recommendation is build one outside, uh, maybe under a roof so you can do it in  
**[0:33:09-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:33:09):**  the winter time, but in a very safe place where you're not going to catch anything on  
**[0:33:13-0:33:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:33:13):**  fire.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:33:14):**  You're not going to, um, fill your house with CO2 or anything like that.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:33:20):**  Yep.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:33:21):**  Um, yeah, because they're actually, there's some things in there that are not totally  
**[0:33:25-0:33:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:33:25):**  obvious to make them work well.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:33:28):**  And um, if you get it a little bit off, it won't work well.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:33:31):**  So you want to do all your learning curve on something you can tear down and rebuild.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:33:36):**  So I think that would be my major piece of advice.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:33:40):**  Otherwise, my advice is if you're building an outside, do everything you can think of,  
**[0:33:46-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:33:46):**  screw up in every way you can.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:33:48):**  Um, try things that are crazy.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:33:51):**  Try things that don't work, that you know will work, but try it anyway.  
**[0:33:55-0:34:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:33:55):**  And then, you know, you'll narrow the field of what you can do and you'll get a clear  
**[0:34:01-0:34:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:01):**  idea of how to do it.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:05):**  Then you can go ahead and build it inside.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:06):**  Yeah.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:07):**  Have you found that any of the materials that you've tried just straight up don't hold up  
**[0:34:12-0:34:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:12):**  and could be dangerous if they start to fail?  
**[0:34:14-0:34:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:14):**  Cause I know certain metals will melt at these temperatures.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:17):**  Oh yeah.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:18):**  Don't put any metals inside a heat riser.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:20):**  Yeah.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:21):**  Uh, well, you know, like unless you're building four inch rocket stove or less, that is not  
**[0:34:26-0:34:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:26):**  a batch rocket.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:29):**  And you do not insulate it.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:31):**  And it's just something you want to throw in your truck, take to the beach and um, use  
**[0:34:35-0:34:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:35):**  as like a little cooker.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:36):**  Yeah, that's yeah, fair enough.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:38):**  Those little four inch, really little ones you can make out of like paint cans too.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:42):**  Yeah, totally.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:43):**  And those are cool.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:44):**  They are really fun.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:45):**  You know, who doesn't want to do that?  
**[0:34:46-0:34:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:46):**  You know, but that's where I got started by putting.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:51):**  Like tin cans together.  
**[0:34:52-0:34:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:52):**  I built the tin can rocket stove.  
**[0:34:53-0:34:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:53):**  Yeah.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:54):**  It was in the old book, you know, it was like a one page thing.  
**[0:34:57-0:34:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:57):**  Tin can rocket stove, DIY.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:59):**  And that's a great craft.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:35:00):**  If you've got like adolescent kids who want to do some fire experiments and learn some  
**[0:35:06-0:35:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:35:06):**  things about science.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:35:07):**  I mean, that's where I would really have fun.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:35:10):**  It's like teaching kids to do it on that scale.  
**[0:35:12-0:35:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:35:12):**  Obviously plenty of safety in mind, of course.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:35:15):**  Absolutely totally.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:35:16):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:35:17):**  So yeah, that doesn't work.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:35:18):**  But if you're going to build like a homemade refractory material, man, test that stuff  
**[0:35:24-0:35:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:35:24):**  thoroughly.  
**[0:35:25-0:35:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:35:25):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:35:26):**  Because not every clay will do.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:35:29):**  Some are really low fire, some are much higher fire.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:35:32):**  You know, I've, I've now made some mistakes that way.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:35:37):**  And it hasn't caused any, you know, disasters yet.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:35:42):**  But um, but but like clay heat risers.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:35:45):**  Right, totally.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:35:48):**  I've had some clay heat risers, you know, perlite clay heat risers completely disintegrate  
**[0:35:52-0:35:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:35:52):**  at the bottom.  
**[0:35:55-0:35:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:35:55):**  And expose what is metal behind them, you know, because I'll use like an old piece of  
**[0:35:59-0:36:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:35:59):**  stovepipe and pack inside of that, a perlite clay heat riser.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:36:05):**  And so you know, I've had those things disintegrate because we didn't properly test the clay soil  
**[0:36:11-0:36:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:36:11):**  before we started building.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:36:13):**  So that's important.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:36:15):**  Yep.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:36:16):**  How do you go about testing that clay to make sure that it'll hold up?  
**[0:36:20-0:36:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:36:20):**  I'll make a little test clay ball of my mix, you know, take, you know, dig up your dirt,  
**[0:36:27-0:36:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:36:27):**  your candidate soil, make a test ball and toss it inside a campfire.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:36:32):**  And really get that thing rip roaring or inside a wood stove and just get it rip roaring.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:36:36):**  Just turn that wood stove up to max, you know, like if you got a potbelly stove, make it  
**[0:36:40-0:36:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:36:40):**  glow red.  
**[0:36:43-0:36:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:36:43):**  I guess maybe I shouldn't encourage people to do that kind of thing, but we've said all  
**[0:36:48-0:36:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:36:48):**  our disclaimers, right?  
**[0:36:51-0:36:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:36:51):**  Yeah, I'm often accused of encouraging people to do dangerous and stupid things.  
**[0:36:57-0:37:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:36:57):**  I mean, this is why I called you for this episode.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:37:00):**  Nice.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:37:02):**  Okay.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:37:04):**  So what are you looking for to see if it has failed or if it succeeded?  
**[0:37:08-0:37:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:37:08):**  Is it just going to disintegrate in that heat or is it is it like major cracking?  
**[0:37:12-0:37:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:37:12):**  Yeah, well, I mean the, the, the surest, the surest fire way of knowing it's not going  
**[0:37:17-0:37:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:37:17):**  to work is when you go back into the wood stove to dig it out and you can't find it.  
**[0:37:21-0:37:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:37:21):**  Yeah, fair enough.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:37:22):**  You know, it will disintegrate completely.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:37:24):**  That's the worst case scenario, but I mean, you could also see it, you could pull it out  
**[0:37:30-0:37:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:37:30):**  and it will basically turn to glass and big glassy bubbles all over the place.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:37:35):**  All right.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:37:36):**  That's not going to last very long as a heat riser typically.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:37:41):**  That might work okay.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:37:42):**  And other parts of the firebox, but if it's turning into slag basically it looks like  
**[0:37:48-0:37:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:37:48):**  lava.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:37:49):**  Yeah.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:37:50):**  Yeah.  
**[0:37:51-0:37:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:37:51):**  Then, uh, that's not going to hold up.  
**[0:37:52-0:37:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:37:52):**  Is it just too much silica or probably, you know, the constituency of your clay is wrong.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:37:58):**  It's um, yeah, I'm not sure exactly.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:00):**  Maybe the alumina content is too low.  
**[0:38:02-0:38:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:02):**  The silica content's too high.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:03):**  Yeah.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:05):**  I don't have a microscope.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:06):**  I'm not going to go that far into it.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:07):**  I'm not either.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:08):**  I have a visual cues.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:09):**  That's good.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:10):**  Yeah.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:11):**  It's just the wrong junk, you know?  
**[0:38:12-0:38:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:12):**  Yeah.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:13):**  Um, I've never really bothered to get super deep into the chemistry of all this stuff.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:18):**  Sure.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:19):**  Um, I, I never bought like a high end smoke detector.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:23):**  What are those things?  
**[0:38:24-0:38:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:24):**  A testo analyzer.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:27):**  I sniff at the stove pipe, which your nose, your nose is actually more sensitive than  
**[0:38:33-0:38:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:33):**  those testo analyzers.  
**[0:38:34-0:38:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:34):**  It just won't give you a percentage of numbers.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:37):**  Sure.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:38):**  Sure.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:39):**  So, you know, I sniff around a stovepipes and go, well, we can do better and you know,  
**[0:38:43-0:38:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:43):**  and then, yeah.  
**[0:38:45-0:38:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:45):**  Anyway.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:46):**  Um, so, you know, so I guess my thing is I've always been Mr. Low tech.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:50):**  Yeah.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:51):**  I mean, but through that you, you can definitely come to the conclusions, the innovations and  
**[0:38:56-0:38:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:56):**  things that are actually going to work in practicality.  
**[0:38:59-0:39:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:59):**  Maybe you don't have all of the stats and the engineering to back it up, but you know,  
**[0:39:04-0:39:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:39:04):**  pretty in and out, like what's going to work in the context that you're trying it out from.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:39:08):**  Right.  
**[0:39:09-0:39:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:39:09):**  And let's face it for most of us and our needs, we don't actually need to know that junk.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:39:13):**  No one even knows what works and what doesn't work.  
**[0:39:15-0:39:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:39:15):**  And I can transfer what works in a small, you know, letter form or email form to somebody  
**[0:39:21-0:39:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:39:21):**  on the other side of the globe and they can go out and just build it.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:39:24):**  Right.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:39:25):**  All right.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:39:26):**  So we just talked about a lot of the options for low tech solutions to building these types  
**[0:39:31-0:39:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:39:31):**  of things that will stand up to the heat.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:39:33):**  What are some of the conventional or I guess the materials that you could purchase that  
**[0:39:38-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:39:38):**  are more high performance to take out the guesswork if that's not where you want to  
**[0:39:41-0:39:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:39:41):**  start?  
**[0:39:42-0:39:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:39:42):**  Well, you could buy a bad bag fire clay, which is, you know, it's a product that's used all  
**[0:39:49-0:39:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:39:49):**  the time and stoves and stuff like that.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:39:51):**  You could also buy stuff called castable refractory, which is a kind of high temperature stove  
**[0:39:58-0:40:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:39:58):**  cement or like a kind of high temperature concrete almost.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:40:03):**  Okay.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:40:04):**  And that's like casting your own piece.  
**[0:40:07-0:40:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:40:07):**  Yeah, you can cast your own pieces.  
**[0:40:08-0:40:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:40:08):**  You can cast your own stove bodies and stuff like that.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:40:12):**  Peter Vandenberg talks about that a lot in his batch rocket website.  
**[0:40:17-0:40:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:40:17):**  Okay.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:40:20):**  And there's a lot of different varieties of stove cement and castable refractory.  
**[0:40:27-0:40:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:40:27):**  And I'm not really the guy that can recommend one over another.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:40:30):**  Yeah, no, you're my low tech guy.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:40:32):**  That's good.  
**[0:40:33-0:40:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:40:33):**  Right.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:40:34):**  And that's how I've always operated too, because a lot of these things were not easy to get  
**[0:40:39-0:40:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:40:39):**  or even available when I was in Guatemala.  
**[0:40:41-0:40:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:40:41):**  So I just learned the way you did.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:40:42):**  Right.  
**[0:40:43-0:40:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:40:43):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:40:44-0:40:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:40:44):**  So, all right, let's pivot again a little bit and talk about some of the upper configurations.  
**[0:40:49-0:40:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:40:49):**  Once we've lit that fire, once we've got it into a heat riser, let's talk about some of  
**[0:40:53-0:40:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:40:53):**  the options for using it because we covered a little bit of, you know, the simplest one  
**[0:40:59-0:41:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:40:59):**  using the heat directly at the source for cooking.  
**[0:41:03-0:41:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:41:03):**  But let's get an idea of some of the other ways that the heat can be leveraged.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:41:07):**  Well, as you mentioned, there's cooking, but you could also store it.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:41:12):**  Okay, so you can shoot that heat into a metal box and radiate it immediately into the house.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:41:19):**  Okay, so radiative heat for a space.  
**[0:41:22-0:41:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:41:22):**  Yeah, radiative heat for a space, which is nice.  
**[0:41:25-0:41:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:41:25):**  And there are a number of ways of doing that.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:41:27):**  Let's break down a few of those options because the one that I was more familiar with was  
**[0:41:31-0:41:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:41:31):**  up-turning an oil drum over the top of that and routing it through kind of an extended  
**[0:41:36-0:41:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:41:36):**  exhaust system to hopefully try and radiate as much of that heat out before it leaves  
**[0:41:41-0:41:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:41:41):**  the building.  
**[0:41:42-0:41:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:41:42):**  Yeah, that's the classic rocker stove slash barrel slash bench thing.  
**[0:41:47-0:41:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:41:47):**  Yep.  
**[0:41:48-0:41:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:41:48):**  And that works great because you have a balance of instant radiated heat with sort of a stored  
**[0:41:53-0:41:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:41:53):**  heat and a thermal mass.  
**[0:41:54-0:41:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:41:54):**  Yep.  
**[0:41:55-0:41:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:41:55):**  And if the thermal mass is made into a bench, then that stored heat can be enjoyed directly  
**[0:41:59-0:42:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:41:59):**  by sitting on it.  
**[0:42:00-0:42:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:00):**  Yep.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:01):**  That's pretty sweet.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:03):**  But it's really heavy.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:04):**  It takes up a lot of space.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:06):**  Sure, sure.  
**[0:42:07-0:42:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:07):**  Quite an installation, especially if you've got a smaller living room.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:10):**  Right, exactly.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:11):**  It's a major installation.  
**[0:42:13-0:42:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:13):**  And quite honestly, it's not the most efficient thing for storing that heat.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:20):**  Well, let me not use the word efficiency on that.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:24):**  But what it is, is it's not always most convenient because the bench has a pipe inside it and  
**[0:42:30-0:42:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:30):**  the pipe's going to be hotter near the stove and cooler on the other end.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:34):**  So whoever's sitting closest to the stove is getting the most heat and whoever's sitting  
**[0:42:37-0:42:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:37):**  farthest away from the stove is getting the least heat.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:40):**  Makes sense.  
**[0:42:41-0:42:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:41):**  How is it on maintenance?  
**[0:42:43-0:42:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:43):**  Because though I've used these systems, I've not lived with them for a long period of time  
**[0:42:46-0:42:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:46):**  and had to deal with cleaning out the exhaust.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:50):**  That sort of depends on how you put it together.  
**[0:42:52-0:42:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:52):**  Sure.  
**[0:42:53-0:42:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:53):**  Those pipe runs, you know, you have to be able to get in and pull the ash out.  
**[0:42:57-0:42:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:58-0:42:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:58):**  So you need good clean outs.  
**[0:42:59-0:43:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:59):**  How often is it sitting up though?  
**[0:43:02-0:43:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:43:02):**  How often did you have to clean out yours?  
**[0:43:04-0:43:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:43:04):**  Oh boy.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:43:05):**  Maybe once every year or two.  
**[0:43:07-0:43:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:43:07):**  Couple years.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:43:08):**  Okay, so not too bad.  
**[0:43:09-0:43:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:43:09):**  It's not like every couple of months you've got to open the thing up.  
**[0:43:13-0:43:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:43:13):**  No, no, no.  
**[0:43:14-0:43:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:43:14):**  Like every four or five fires, I'll clean out the firebox itself, like pull the ash  
**[0:43:19-0:43:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:43:19):**  out of the box.  
**[0:43:21-0:43:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:43:21):**  And then maybe every year I'll open it up and look inside.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:43:27):**  And maybe every two years, three years, I'll actually clean it.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:43:30):**  Gotcha.  
**[0:43:31-0:43:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:43:31):**  You know, because ash will find the most inconvenient place to pile up and it'll pile up right there.  
**[0:43:39-0:43:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:43:39):**  So if you don't have a clean out opening into that, then you're going to have a hell of  
**[0:43:44-0:43:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:43:44):**  a time getting it out.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:43:46):**  Makes sense.  
**[0:43:47-0:43:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:43:47):**  But if you're clever or you're just thinking about it, you know, you put clean outs in  
**[0:43:53-0:43:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:43:53):**  the right spots, it makes it so easy.  
**[0:43:55-0:44:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:43:55):**  And is that mostly like around elbows or places where it starts to...  
**[0:44:00-0:44:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:00):**  Yeah.  
**[0:44:01-0:44:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:01):**  Yeah.  
**[0:44:02-0:44:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:02):**  Like a wide spot in the flow will do it too.  
**[0:44:06-0:44:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:06):**  Okay.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:07):**  Usually they'll have a little bit of dropout just below the heat riser on the bottom end  
**[0:44:12-0:44:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:12):**  of the barrel.  
**[0:44:13-0:44:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:13):**  You'll get a lot of pile up right there.  
**[0:44:16-0:44:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:16):**  And then you'll get another pile, probably if you run down the bench and then make a  
**[0:44:22-0:44:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:22):**  180 and come back to the bench down at your 180 area, you'll end up with some stuff piled  
**[0:44:28-0:44:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:28):**  up there.  
**[0:44:29-0:44:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:29):**  And a thin skim all the way along often as well.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:34):**  And it's mostly just a matter of running a large, like a duct cleaner or almost like  
**[0:44:39-0:44:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:39):**  a chimney sweep apparatus.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:41):**  I don't know what they're called, but to go in and kind of sweep out the interior of the  
**[0:44:45-0:44:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:45):**  exhaust.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:46):**  Yeah.  
**[0:44:47-0:44:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:44:48-0:44:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:48):**  If you got electricity, running a shop vac down that is nice.  
**[0:44:51-0:44:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:51):**  Oh, yeah.  
**[0:44:52-0:44:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:52):**  With an extendo hose on it, you need to stick the hose in and...  
**[0:44:55-0:44:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:55):**  That's not too bad then.  
**[0:44:57-0:44:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:44:58-0:44:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:58):**  It doesn't have to be that bad.  
**[0:44:59-0:45:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:59):**  I've made a little thing like a long hoe.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:45:03):**  You know, it's usually a very small hoe head on a really long handle if you don't have  
**[0:45:10-0:45:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:45:10):**  the electricity.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:45:11):**  Yeah.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:45:12):**  But then you need to be in a kind of...  
**[0:45:14-0:45:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:45:14):**  The clean out has to be set in such a way that you could actually use a long handled  
**[0:45:19-0:45:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:45:19):**  hoe on it.  
**[0:45:20-0:45:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:45:20):**  Yeah.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:45:21):**  Because if it's near a wall, that's not happening.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:45:23):**  Sure.  
**[0:45:24-0:45:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:45:24):**  So you kind of got to think this one out before...  
**[0:45:27-0:45:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:45:27):**  Requires some planning ahead of time.  
**[0:45:29-0:45:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:45:29):**  Right.  
**[0:45:30-0:45:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:45:30):**  It's a major installation.  
**[0:45:32-0:45:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:45:32):**  Yeah, they are a major installation.  
**[0:45:35-0:45:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:45:35):**  So another way of going about that, something that I prefer now actually is something called  
**[0:45:41-0:45:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:45:41):**  a bell.  
**[0:45:44-0:45:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:45:44):**  And what a bell is, is it's just a large chamber that the heat enters the large chamber.  
**[0:45:50-0:45:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:45:50):**  Well, okay, so it's a large chamber that has its exhaust, its chimney exhaust at the very  
**[0:45:55-0:45:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:45:55):**  bottom.  
**[0:45:58-0:46:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:45:58):**  So that when heat enters this chamber, it will go into this sort of free gas movement.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:46:03):**  It's sort of a natural convective mode where the hotter stuff will tenderize to the top  
**[0:46:09-0:46:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:46:09):**  and the cooler stuff in there will tend to go to the bottom and find the chimney.  
**[0:46:12-0:46:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:46:12):**  How large of a chamber are we talking in general here?  
**[0:46:15-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:46:15):**  Well, that's going to depend on the size of the firebox and how much heat you're producing.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:46:21):**  Because the chamber is sized, it's about the internal surface area of that thing and also  
**[0:46:30-0:46:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:46:30):**  what it's made out of.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:46:31):**  So the barrel over your heat riser could be treated like a bell by raising the barrel  
**[0:46:39-0:46:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:46:39):**  up a ways.  
**[0:46:40-0:46:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:46:40):**  Right, right.  
**[0:46:41-0:46:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:46:41):**  Right?  
**[0:46:42-0:46:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:46:42):**  So that, I mean, but that because it's steel, it's going to radiate heat faster.  
**[0:46:47-0:46:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:46:47):**  So you're going to have a smaller bell than if it was, say, made out of brick.  
**[0:46:53-0:46:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:46:53):**  Gotcha.  
**[0:46:54-0:47:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:46:54):**  Right, because brick will transfer heat slower and reach the saturation point where there's  
**[0:47:00-0:47:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:00):**  so much heat in the brick itself that it won't transfer heat out of the flow of the gases  
**[0:47:07-0:47:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:07):**  anymore properly or not very fast.  
**[0:47:10-0:47:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:10):**  You know?  
**[0:47:11-0:47:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:11):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:12-0:47:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:12):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:13-0:47:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:13):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:14):**  And do you have a preference one or the other over that?  
**[0:47:16-0:47:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:16):**  I guess it's just how fast you want to heat a space and for how long?  
**[0:47:20-0:47:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:20):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:21-0:47:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:21):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:22-0:47:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:23-0:47:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:23):**  That's sort of a personal preference thing.  
**[0:47:24-0:47:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:24):**  You know, if you're in a big shop, you know, you don't really need a lot of thermal mass  
**[0:47:27-0:47:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:27):**  because you only need the place to be heated up while you're in it.  
**[0:47:30-0:47:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:30):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:31-0:47:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:31):**  So if you're in it and you're, you know, you're working and then you're out of it, you don't  
**[0:47:34-0:47:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:34):**  need storage for overnight.  
**[0:47:35-0:47:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:35):**  So a big, a big metal box is preferable, I think there.  
**[0:47:40-0:47:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:40):**  Um, every aspect of design context is everything.  
**[0:47:44-0:47:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:44):**  Everything.  
**[0:47:45-0:47:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:45):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:46-0:47:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:46):**  You know, if you live in a home and you want to sleep warm all night, you know, but you  
**[0:47:50-0:47:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:50):**  don't want to get up every couple hours to feed the fire, then you want, you want a lot  
**[0:47:55-0:47:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:55):**  of thermal mass.  
**[0:47:56-0:47:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:56):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:57-0:47:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:58-0:47:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:58):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:59-0:48:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:59):**  You know, it's like ovens, you know, bread ovens.  
**[0:48:02-0:48:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:48:02):**  Um, the old traditional earth and bread ovens are very big, very heavy.  
**[0:48:08-0:48:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:48:08):**  They have lots and lots of thermal mass.  
**[0:48:10-0:48:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:48:10):**  Um, because the entire village would get together on a Saturday and everyone would cook, you  
**[0:48:17-0:48:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:48:17):**  know, and so one big fire the night before and another big fire in the morning and now  
**[0:48:21-0:48:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:48:21):**  you're cooking all day long.  
**[0:48:23-0:48:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:48:23):**  Yeah.  
**[0:48:24-0:48:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:48:24):**  Yeah.  
**[0:48:25-0:48:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:48:25):**  And that makes a lot of sense.  
**[0:48:26-0:48:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:48:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:48:27-0:48:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:48:27):**  Some of the traditional bakeries that I saw in Morocco would still offer that as a, as  
**[0:48:30-0:48:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:48:30):**  a service.  
**[0:48:31-0:48:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:48:31):**  You could bring your own homemade loaves and they'll bake them for you there for a couple  
**[0:48:37-0:48:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:48:37):**  of cents.  
**[0:48:38-0:48:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:48:38):**  Yeah.  
**[0:48:39-0:48:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:48:39):**  And it's cool that parts of communities are still intact like that.  
**[0:48:41-0:48:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:48:41):**  I mean, that's really cool, but okay.  
**[0:48:43-0:48:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:48:43):**  But take it like look at here in the States, um, where an earthen oven is going to be in  
**[0:48:48-0:48:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:48:48):**  one guy's backyard and it's going to be used to throw pizza in an evening on Saturday only,  
**[0:48:56-0:49:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:48:56):**  you know, that guy doesn't, it's just an installation that doesn't really get used.  
**[0:49:00-0:49:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:49:00):**  Exactly.  
**[0:49:01-0:49:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:49:01):**  So that guy doesn't need a lot of thermal mass.  
**[0:49:03-0:49:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:49:03):**  And because if you're just throwing pizza, you're going to keep the fire in the back  
**[0:49:06-0:49:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:49:06):**  of the oven anyway, what you really want is less thermal mass and maybe more insulation.  
**[0:49:11-0:49:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:49:11):**  Right.  
**[0:49:12-0:49:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:49:12):**  So it's all about not just, um, you know, well it's, it's all about your pattern of  
**[0:49:19-0:49:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:49:19):**  use.  
**[0:49:20-0:49:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:49:20):**  Mm hmm.  
**[0:49:21-0:49:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:49:21):**  Um, so anyway, so back to the rock of mastos, um,  
**[0:49:26-0:49:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:49:26):**  Those okay.  
**[0:49:27-0:49:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:49:27):**  So we, we covered a little bit about the bells.  
**[0:49:29-0:49:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:49:29):**  Where does the exhaust go after it leaves that chamber?  
**[0:49:32-0:49:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:49:32):**  Like you said, the convection is going to push the colder gases down below and keep  
**[0:49:37-0:49:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:49:37):**  the hotter ones in that chamber to radiate out into the space.  
**[0:49:40-0:49:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:49:40):**  Right.  
**[0:49:41-0:49:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:49:41):**  So as they cool, they drop down on the gate into your chimney.  
**[0:49:44-0:49:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:49:44):**  Now there, this is where you have to be careful about your sizing of your mass because if  
**[0:49:48-0:49:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:49:48):**  you soak up too much of the heat and the flow, then the gases may, you know, your exhaust  
**[0:49:54-0:49:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:49:54):**  may not rise out the chimney anymore.  
**[0:49:56-0:49:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:49:56):**  Yeah.  
**[0:49:57-0:49:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:49:57):**  You could, you have an issue of it backing up.  
**[0:49:58-0:49:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:49:58):**  Yeah.  
**[0:49:59-0:50:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:49:59):**  So you need, you need that chimney exhaust at the point of exhaust, you know, where it  
**[0:50:03-0:50:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:03):**  leaves the pipes and goes out into the environment.  
**[0:50:06-0:50:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:06):**  Not to drop below for safety sake, about 200 degrees Fahrenheit or around a hundred degrees  
**[0:50:11-0:50:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:11):**  Celsius.  
**[0:50:12-0:50:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:12):**  Mm hmm.  
**[0:50:13-0:50:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:13):**  Okay.  
**[0:50:14-0:50:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:14):**  So, so that's sort of the safety point.  
**[0:50:15-0:50:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:15):**  Now I built stoves that exhaust at much lower temperatures than that, but it's not a good  
**[0:50:20-0:50:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:20):**  idea.  
**[0:50:21-0:50:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:21):**  You know, I mean on one hand you get to keep more heat inside the building, but there are  
**[0:50:26-0:50:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:26):**  times and days where you won't be able to start the stove at all.  
**[0:50:30-0:50:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:30):**  If you do that, you'll have to find a way to prime it somehow.  
**[0:50:34-0:50:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:34):**  Even if you prime it, it'll stall.  
**[0:50:35-0:50:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:35):**  It'll stall.  
**[0:50:36-0:50:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:36):**  Yeah.  
**[0:50:37-0:50:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:37):**  Well, okay.  
**[0:50:38-0:50:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:38):**  So here's a condition, right?  
**[0:50:39-0:50:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:39):**  So you are in a cob house, right?  
**[0:50:43-0:50:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:43):**  Great thermal mass, but it goes cold.  
**[0:50:46-0:50:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:46):**  You know, let's say it's gone cold and you have a warm day outside, but the cob is cold  
**[0:50:51-0:50:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:51):**  inside the house.  
**[0:50:52-0:50:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:52):**  Yeah.  
**[0:50:53-0:50:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:53):**  Yeah.  
**[0:50:54-0:50:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:54):**  And you want to get that fire started.  
**[0:50:55-0:51:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:55):**  You want to warm up the house and for some silly reason, you're inside on a beautiful  
**[0:51:01-0:51:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:51:01):**  warm day in a cold house.  
**[0:51:05-0:51:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:51:05):**  You're not going to start that fire.  
**[0:51:06-0:51:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:51:06):**  No, it's going to be reverse exhausting the whole time.  
**[0:51:10-0:51:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:51:10):**  It's going to reverse run in your face.  
**[0:51:12-0:51:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:51:12):**  And, and even if you do have a primer box and you get the chimney hot temporarily, it's  
**[0:51:17-0:51:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:51:17):**  not going to last.  
**[0:51:19-0:51:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:51:19):**  Mm.  
**[0:51:20-0:51:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:51:20):**  Um, so that's a disadvantage.  
**[0:51:23-0:51:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:51:23):**  Also like here in my stove at home, uh, in, in the little hut that I live in, um, it's  
**[0:51:28-0:51:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:51:28):**  called a huckleberry.  
**[0:51:29-0:51:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:51:29):**  It's a cute little hut.  
**[0:51:30-0:51:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:51:30):**  It is a cute little hut.  
**[0:51:32-0:51:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:51:32):**  Um, so what I've got an issue in there in that my exhaust temperature is so low on that  
**[0:51:40-0:51:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:51:40):**  stove that the chimney is cold to the touch always.  
**[0:51:45-0:51:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:51:45):**  Right?  
**[0:51:46-0:51:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:51:46):**  Yeah.  
**[0:51:47-0:51:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:51:47):**  Um, and if it rains like big rainy nights, even though it's cold, it's warmer inside  
**[0:51:54-0:51:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:51:54):**  the hut than the outside.  
**[0:51:55-0:51:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:51:55):**  So you're getting positive pressure effects of a warmer space.  
**[0:51:59-0:52:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:51:59):**  If rain actively runs down my chimney pipe on the outside, it'll cool the exhaust off  
**[0:52:05-0:52:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:52:05):**  to the point where it'll start backfiring on the inside of the building.  
**[0:52:08-0:52:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:52:08):**  Right?  
**[0:52:09-0:52:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:52:09):**  Yeah.  
**[0:52:10-0:52:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:52:10):**  So, yeah, maybe not the cleverest thing that I decided, Hey, let's keep more heat inside  
**[0:52:15-0:52:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:52:15):**  the building, shall we didn't, doesn't always work.  
**[0:52:20-0:52:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:52:20):**  Sure.  
**[0:52:21-0:52:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:52:21):**  You don't really get to test it out until those circumstances arise.  
**[0:52:25-0:52:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:52:25):**  Sometimes it's hard to predict.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:52:26):**  Yeah, I thought it'd be okay.  
**[0:52:27-0:52:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:52:27):**  Cause most of the time it runs great except for that coldest night of the year when it's  
**[0:52:32-0:52:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:52:32):**  also raining, which is sort of reverse of what you think.  
**[0:52:37-0:52:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:52:37):**  But you know, again, like if it, because I live in it now all the time, that happens  
**[0:52:42-0:52:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:52:42):**  less and less and less because I keep the space warm.  
**[0:52:44-0:52:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:52:44):**  I keep the chimney warm, you know?  
**[0:52:47-0:52:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:52:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:52:48-0:52:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:52:48):**  Yeah.  
**[0:52:49-0:52:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:52:49):**  Okay.  
**[0:52:50-0:52:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:52:50):**  So let's talk about some of the other things that you can do with that heat.  
**[0:52:53-0:52:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:52:53):**  Other ways of maybe reclaiming exhaust or using it to heat water or some other element.  
**[0:52:58-0:52:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:52:58):**  Yeah.  
**[0:52:59-0:53:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:52:59):**  Again.  
**[0:53:00-0:53:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:00):**  Yeah.  
**[0:53:01-0:53:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:01):**  You can use it to heat water.  
**[0:53:02-0:53:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:02):**  I like putting a hot water tank inside of a bell chamber.  
**[0:53:04-0:53:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:04):**  Okay.  
**[0:53:06-0:53:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:06):**  That works really well.  
**[0:53:08-0:53:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:08):**  I try not to teach people how to build hot water systems because water is sort of a steam  
**[0:53:14-0:53:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:14):**  explosion problem.  
**[0:53:16-0:53:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:16):**  Right.  
**[0:53:17-0:53:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:17):**  If you don't have a pressure release valve somewhere on that, you're yeah.  
**[0:53:21-0:53:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:21):**  If things go wrong, you've built a bomb.  
**[0:53:23-0:53:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:23):**  Yeah.  
**[0:53:24-0:53:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:24):**  If things go wrong, you built a bomb and, and there is actually a great system designed  
**[0:53:28-0:53:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:28):**  by Tim Barker.  
**[0:53:30-0:53:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:30):**  Um, uh, he, he did it at Tagari farms.  
**[0:53:34-0:53:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:34):**  You might've seen this already.  
**[0:53:35-0:53:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:35):**  It's a double boiler system.  
**[0:53:37-0:53:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:37):**  I haven't seen this one.  
**[0:53:39-0:53:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:39):**  This is so cool.  
**[0:53:40-0:53:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:40):**  So what you do is you heat up, you directly heat an open pot, an open tank of water.  
**[0:53:46-0:53:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:46):**  And inside that you put a pressurized coil, a copper coil.  
**[0:53:50-0:53:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:50):**  So because you're directly heating up an open, open container, the open container can just  
**[0:53:55-0:53:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:55):**  steam away.  
**[0:53:56-0:53:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:56):**  No pressure can build up.  
**[0:53:57-0:53:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:57):**  Okay.  
**[0:53:58-0:54:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:58):**  Well, hotter than boiling point.  
**[0:54:00-0:54:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:54:00):**  Exactly.  
**[0:54:01-0:54:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:54:01):**  It'll never get hotter than the boiling point of whatever altitude you're at.  
**[0:54:04-0:54:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:54:04):**  Um, 212 degrees Fahrenheit at sea level.  
**[0:54:08-0:54:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:54:08):**  Sure.  
**[0:54:09-0:54:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:54:09):**  Um, but because pressurized water has a higher boiling temperature, the coil that's inside  
**[0:54:16-0:54:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:54:16):**  of that open tank, uh, cannot, cannot boil.  
**[0:54:22-0:54:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:54:22):**  Yep.  
**[0:54:23-0:54:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:54:23):**  So then what you do is you use the, um, the big tank that you're heating directly.  
**[0:54:28-0:54:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:54:28):**  That's your sort of a heat storage zone.  
**[0:54:31-0:54:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:54:31):**  And then the copper coil running through that is taking heat from that and taking that to  
**[0:54:35-0:54:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:54:35):**  your shower or whatever your hot water uses.  
**[0:54:38-0:54:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:54:38):**  Cool.  
**[0:54:39-0:54:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:54:39):**  That's very cool.  
**[0:54:40-0:54:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:54:40):**  Yeah.  
**[0:54:41-0:54:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:54:41):**  That's a clever application built in safety system.  
**[0:54:45-0:54:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:54:45):**  You don't even need a pressure, anything.  
**[0:54:46-0:54:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:54:46):**  You don't need a pressure relief valve or any of that stuff because you could totally  
**[0:54:49-0:54:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:54:49):**  just boil out the big tank.  
**[0:54:51-0:54:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:54:51):**  And as long as the coil doesn't touch the sides, you know, I suspended from wire.  
**[0:54:56-0:54:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:54:56):**  Yeah.  
**[0:54:57-0:54:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:54:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:54:58-0:55:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:54:58):**  As long as the coil doesn't touch the sides, it can't blow up.  
**[0:55:00-0:55:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:00):**  Oh, I'm going to have to check that out.  
**[0:55:02-0:55:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:02):**  That's really cool.  
**[0:55:03-0:55:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:03):**  Yeah.  
**[0:55:04-0:55:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:04):**  Have you ever played around with heating other elements like oil that do have a much higher  
**[0:55:08-0:55:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:08):**  boiling temp kind of for safety reasons, but can also store a lot of that heat that way?  
**[0:55:14-0:55:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:14):**  I have not done that.  
**[0:55:16-0:55:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:16):**  That's a really interesting thing.  
**[0:55:18-0:55:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:18):**  I've always thought about heating oil directly then to heat water somehow.  
**[0:55:22-0:55:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:55:23-0:55:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:23):**  By running water through it like a, like through a pipe or something.  
**[0:55:26-0:55:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:26):**  Exactly.  
**[0:55:27-0:55:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:27):**  That's a little dangerous though, because some oil you can get to like 400 degrees dangerous.  
**[0:55:32-0:55:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:32):**  And then you go running water through a pipe that's in 400 degree Fahrenheit oil, you know,  
**[0:55:38-0:55:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:38):**  this is where you got to put in those safety systems.  
**[0:55:40-0:55:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:40):**  Right.  
**[0:55:41-0:55:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:41):**  But you might be able to run a steam engine off of something like that.  
**[0:55:43-0:55:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:43):**  Exactly.  
**[0:55:44-0:55:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:44):**  I guess I'm kind of little turbine going.  
**[0:55:47-0:55:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:47):**  You bet.  
**[0:55:48-0:55:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:48):**  Yeah.  
**[0:55:49-0:55:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:49):**  I mean, that's a cool idea.  
**[0:55:50-0:55:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:50):**  I haven't done that.  
**[0:55:51-0:55:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:51):**  I'd I'd like to someday, you know, maybe make a little steam engine off of that or something  
**[0:55:56-0:55:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:56):**  Sterling cycle engine that runs off of that.  
**[0:55:58-0:56:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:58):**  It'd be fun to play with.  
**[0:56:00-0:56:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:00):**  Right.  
**[0:56:01-0:56:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:01):**  Have you ever worked on trying to reclaim heat from a cook stove?  
**[0:56:05-0:56:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:05):**  Like putting something in the exhaust?  
**[0:56:08-0:56:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:08):**  Oh, yeah.  
**[0:56:09-0:56:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:09):**  Yeah.  
**[0:56:10-0:56:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:10):**  I've done like a, had a cook stove that had multiple, multiple cooking areas, you know,  
**[0:56:16-0:56:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:16):**  because there's, there's the spot right over the heat riser.  
**[0:56:19-0:56:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:19):**  That's really hot.  
**[0:56:20-0:56:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:20):**  Yeah.  
**[0:56:21-0:56:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:21):**  But just out of stream a couple of steps.  
**[0:56:22-0:56:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:22):**  It's also still really hot.  
**[0:56:24-0:56:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:24):**  Yeah.  
**[0:56:25-0:56:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:25):**  Yeah.  
**[0:56:26-0:56:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:26):**  You know, so, um, I'll have like a, a, a, a hot, fast boil heat area, a slow boil heat  
**[0:56:31-0:56:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:31):**  area, a simmer area and a warmer.  
**[0:56:34-0:56:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:34):**  Yeah.  
**[0:56:35-0:56:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:35):**  So somewhere in between the slow boil and the warmer, I'll put a little hot water heater,  
**[0:56:40-0:56:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:40):**  like the little coil hot water heater that we're talking that we just talked about.  
**[0:56:43-0:56:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:43):**  Yeah.  
**[0:56:44-0:56:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:44):**  Yeah.  
**[0:56:45-0:56:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:45):**  Yeah.  
**[0:56:46-0:56:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:46):**  That's a great thing right there.  
**[0:56:47-0:56:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:47):**  Um, uh, you know, you can drop bricks in something like that and wrap a brick, that brick and  
**[0:56:51-0:56:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:51):**  a towel and take it to bed with you.  
**[0:56:53-0:56:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:53):**  Yeah.  
**[0:56:54-0:56:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:54):**  Almost like a hot water bottle heater.  
**[0:56:56-0:56:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:56):**  Yeah.  
**[0:56:57-0:56:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:57):**  Kind of like a hot water bottle, et cetera.  
**[0:56:59-0:57:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:59):**  But you don't stand the risk of accidentally puncturing it and ending up with a wet bed.  
**[0:57:04-0:57:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:57:04):**  One of the advantages, but then of course you're sleeping with a brick.  
**[0:57:08-0:57:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:57:08):**  So that's true.  
**[0:57:09-0:57:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:57:09):**  Yeah.  
**[0:57:10-0:57:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:57:10):**  He's sleeping with a brick.  
**[0:57:11-0:57:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:57:11):**  There's give and take on that one.  
**[0:57:13-0:57:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:57:13):**  I always kind of thought about putting some kind of heat exchanger in it that would route  
**[0:57:16-0:57:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:57:16):**  into a sauna and having that at a fairly constant heat whenever you're running another element  
**[0:57:23-0:57:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:57:23):**  and then, you know, go in for a sauna after a meal or something.  
**[0:57:26-0:57:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:57:26):**  That sounds great.  
**[0:57:27-0:57:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:57:27):**  Um, the amount of heat you need in a sauna though, depends on the design of the sauna  
**[0:57:33-0:57:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:57:33):**  and how you're heating it.  
**[0:57:35-0:57:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:57:35):**  If that's like in an open coil and it's heating the air directly through convection or if  
**[0:57:39-0:57:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:57:39):**  you're running it through a bank and like keeping a low level constant heat for a long  
**[0:57:45-0:57:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:57:45):**  time, because depending on, I mean, I like the, the Temasco ceremonies in Guatemala or  
**[0:57:52-0:57:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:57:52):**  Mexico kind of run a little bit differently and they last a little longer.  
**[0:57:57-0:58:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:57:57):**  So you can't have it as nearly high of a heat.  
**[0:58:00-0:58:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:00):**  It was one of the things that I was designing and building for clients a lot while I was  
**[0:58:03-0:58:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:03):**  out there because so many people had the vacation homes and the climate was really nice.  
**[0:58:08-0:58:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:08):**  So they'd like have a pool and then they build these saunas and some of them would even use  
**[0:58:11-0:58:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:11):**  them for ceremonies and stuff.  
**[0:58:13-0:58:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:13):**  Just got me thinking about a lot of different ways of using that heat in different ways.  
**[0:58:17-0:58:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:17):**  Yeah, I'd like to see that.  
**[0:58:20-0:58:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:20):**  Oh, excuse me.  
**[0:58:21-0:58:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:21):**  I'd like to see that sort of any designs that you've come up with it.  
**[0:58:23-0:58:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:23):**  Oh man, I was going to start designing one at our place before I left, but I didn't get  
**[0:58:27-0:58:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:27):**  a chance to do that before I've made the move now.  
**[0:58:30-0:58:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:30):**  Well, yeah, well, well, okay.  
**[0:58:32-0:58:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:32):**  I'll talk to you about that later.  
**[0:58:34-0:58:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:34):**  Sure, sure.  
**[0:58:35-0:58:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:35):**  Where are you moving to?  
**[0:58:37-0:58:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:37):**  But later that's.  
**[0:58:38-0:58:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:38):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:58:39-0:58:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:39):**  Well, I mean, people who've been listening here probably already know I'm moving to Spain  
**[0:58:42-0:58:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:42):**  actually one week from today.  
**[0:58:44-0:58:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:44):**  So Oh, awesome.  
**[0:58:46-0:58:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:46):**  That's going to be a cool new chapter.  
**[0:58:47-0:58:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:47):**  I'll keep you posted.  
**[0:58:48-0:58:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:48):**  I mean, I listen to your stuff all the time, but sometimes I don't get it.  
**[0:58:51-0:58:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:51):**  So especially lately, I've been publishing a lot of them out of sequence because I recorded  
**[0:58:55-0:59:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:55):**  a ton in Guatemala before I came out and I wanted to, you know, not be working too much  
**[0:59:01-0:59:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:01):**  or throw off my schedule.  
**[0:59:03-0:59:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:03):**  I was visiting family.  
**[0:59:05-0:59:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:05):**  So a lot of them are, you know, a handful of weeks old or like bundled into topics now.  
**[0:59:09-0:59:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:09):**  Huh?  
**[0:59:10-0:59:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:10):**  And this one's good.  
**[0:59:11-0:59:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:11):**  This one's going to be the same.  
**[0:59:12-0:59:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:12):**  This is going to come out after I've already moved to Spain.  
**[0:59:14-0:59:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:14):**  So right, right.  
**[0:59:15-0:59:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:15):**  All right.  
**[0:59:16-0:59:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:16):**  Well, I'll have to check that out.  
**[0:59:17-0:59:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:17):**  I'll check that out.  
**[0:59:18-0:59:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:18):**  All right.  
**[0:59:19-0:59:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:19):**  So here, let's focus now on how these things can be leveraged in the home because you know,  
**[0:59:23-0:59:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:23):**  as you mentioned, there are certain areas that are banning wood stoves or wood combustion  
**[0:59:27-0:59:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:27):**  in homes or within urban areas entirely.  
**[0:59:31-0:59:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:31):**  What is your experience on making these safe enough and certainly clean enough that they  
**[0:59:35-0:59:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:35):**  don't pose a risk inside of a home?  
**[0:59:37-0:59:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:37):**  Well, I mean, you know, just build it well.  
**[0:59:42-0:59:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:42):**  Build it well.  
**[0:59:43-0:59:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:43):**  Seal up all the cracks.  
**[0:59:44-0:59:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:44):**  Yeah, seal up all the cracks, build it well, operate it carefully.  
**[0:59:49-0:59:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:49):**  And it's great.  
**[0:59:50-0:59:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:50):**  Because quite often you can't even tell that there's a fire going.  
**[0:59:53-0:59:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:53):**  You know, if you go out and stand out and you look at the chimney, you can't see smoke  
**[0:59:58-1:00:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:58):**  coming out of it.  
**[1:00:01-1:00:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:00:01):**  You know, and if you're careful and you sort of move your head around, you can see heat  
**[1:00:05-1:00:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:00:05):**  waves coming out of it sometimes.  
**[1:00:07-1:00:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:00:07):**  Yeah.  
**[1:00:08-1:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:00:08):**  You know, so you know, somebody who doesn't know what the heck they're looking at, if  
**[1:00:14-1:00:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:00:14):**  they see a chimney pipe with heat waves coming out of it and not smoke, they're going to  
**[1:00:17-1:00:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:00:17):**  go, oh, well, that's a propane device.  
**[1:00:19-1:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:00:19):**  Mmm, propane devices are legal.  
**[1:00:22-1:00:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:00:22):**  Sure.  
**[1:00:23-1:00:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:00:23):**  If I understand you correctly, you're advocating for subversively installing these in cities.  
**[1:00:28-1:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:00:28):**  Oh, I would never advocate for anything subversive.  
**[1:00:33-1:00:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:00:33):**  Of course I am.  
**[1:00:35-1:00:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:00:35):**  But no, you know, actually what I advocate, you know, it's kind of hard to say that it's  
**[1:00:40-1:00:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:00:40):**  a stupid law.  
**[1:00:43-1:00:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:00:43):**  But like everything is probably based in good intentions, right?  
**[1:00:47-1:00:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:00:47):**  But yeah, these are really on the fringe and most people don't know of this as an option  
**[1:00:51-1:00:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:00:51):**  for wood combustion.  
**[1:00:53-1:00:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:00:53):**  It's probably not factored into the lawmaking.  
**[1:00:55-1:00:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:00:55):**  Right, exactly.  
**[1:00:56-1:01:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:00:56):**  Well, I mean, there's a lot of professional heat people like HVAC installers and stuff  
**[1:01:03-1:01:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:01:03):**  like that.  
**[1:01:04-1:01:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:01:04):**  They're saying that our claims are actually lies.  
**[1:01:06-1:01:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:01:06):**  Mmm.  
**[1:01:07-1:01:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:01:07):**  You know, they're saying, no, it's a lie.  
**[1:01:10-1:01:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:01:10):**  You can't do that with wood.  
**[1:01:12-1:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:01:12):**  And you know, okay, fine.  
**[1:01:14-1:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:01:14):**  But uh, yes, again.  
**[1:01:16-1:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:01:16):**  And here's the proof.  
**[1:01:18-1:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:01:18):**  Come see, here's my stove.  
**[1:01:20-1:01:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:01:20):**  Yeah.  
**[1:01:21-1:01:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:01:21):**  But, um, you know, um, I think that what we really need is to have some people, a lot  
**[1:01:28-1:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:01:28):**  of people who want these stoves to go to their local regulatory body and say, check it out.  
**[1:01:34-1:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:01:34):**  I've got this.  
**[1:01:35-1:01:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:01:35):**  Here's some information.  
**[1:01:36-1:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:01:36):**  Here's some documentation.  
**[1:01:37-1:01:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:01:37):**  You know, here's a website or two.  
**[1:01:40-1:01:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:01:40):**  Here's the forums.  
**[1:01:41-1:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:01:41):**  You know, I want to build this thing.  
**[1:01:42-1:01:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:01:42):**  How can we get this put in to our local, you know, um, building codes?  
**[1:01:50-1:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:01:50):**  Yeah.  
**[1:01:51-1:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:01:51):**  Right.  
**[1:01:52-1:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:01:52):**  The thing that I like and that I've learned a lot from different forums and, um, and different  
**[1:01:56-1:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:01:56):**  discussions on this is when you break down the comparison of combustion of different  
**[1:02:00-1:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:02:00):**  materials, there's a lot of things that aren't factored into just the amount of BTUs put  
**[1:02:07-1:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:02:07):**  out from a system.  
**[1:02:09-1:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:02:09):**  Right.  
**[1:02:10-1:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:02:10):**  So if you're using electricity or if you're using propane, what they're not considering  
**[1:02:14-1:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:02:14):**  in those calculations, it is all of the inefficiencies and pollution to get those things to the source  
**[1:02:19-1:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:02:19):**  of use.  
**[1:02:20-1:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:02:20):**  Yeah, that's correct.  
**[1:02:22-1:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:02:22):**  Gathering firewood or sustainably harvesting from a forest is, has none of those embodied  
**[1:02:28-1:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:02:28):**  carbon or pollution metrics that just get it to your house.  
**[1:02:33-1:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:02:33):**  That's right.  
**[1:02:34-1:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:02:34):**  And in fact, it could actually be a carbon negative system if you're careful.  
**[1:02:36-1:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:02:36):**  Absolutely.  
**[1:02:37-1:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:02:37):**  Yeah.  
**[1:02:38-1:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:02:38):**  If done correctly.  
**[1:02:39-1:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:02:39):**  So can we start looking at the calculations from the entire aspect of how these things  
**[1:02:45-1:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:02:45):**  are used, sourced, uh, acquired to begin with?  
**[1:02:48-1:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:02:48):**  I mean, let's talk about all of the, uh, the losses in the electrical grid and how much  
**[1:02:53-1:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:02:53):**  is lost just transferring it through wires to say nothing about like, you know, whether  
**[1:02:57-1:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:02:57):**  it's clean or what source is generating that electricity, which most of the time is still  
**[1:03:02-1:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:03:02):**  not renewables, even if that's your, you know, your best case scenario.  
**[1:03:06-1:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:03:06):**  Yeah, I mean, exactly.  
**[1:03:07-1:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:03:07):**  Totally.  
**[1:03:08-1:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:03:08):**  I don't think I could put it any better than that.  
**[1:03:10-1:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:03:10):**  You know, you have to see the entire life cycle of, of the fuel, not just where it's  
**[1:03:16-1:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:03:16):**  point of use.  
**[1:03:17-1:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:03:17):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[1:03:18-1:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:03:18):**  You know, it goes with so many things that we talk about on this show.  
**[1:03:22-1:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:03:22):**  I mean, you're very well aware of calculating those types of things when you're looking  
**[1:03:27-1:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:03:27):**  at natural building materials, right?  
**[1:03:29-1:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:03:29):**  But you may be, um, doing a lot more work and processing to get them to be used as building  
**[1:03:35-1:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:03:35):**  materials on site.  
**[1:03:38-1:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:03:38):**  They also didn't have to be mined from somewhere a long way away, transported all the way there,  
**[1:03:42-1:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:03:42):**  or like certainly in the case of, uh, cement and stuff, you know, huge amounts of industrial  
**[1:03:48-1:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:03:48):**  processes and tons of fossil fuel burn just to transform the material.  
**[1:03:52-1:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:03:52):**  Absolutely.  
**[1:03:53-1:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:03:53):**  I mean, to be honest with natural building, I have been shocked at myself at the kinds  
**[1:03:59-1:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:03:59):**  of compromises I have to make in order to build a natural building.  
**[1:04:04-1:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:04:04):**  I mean, you know, tarps for mixing, you know, how much plastic junk has come out of this  
**[1:04:08-1:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:04:08):**  place because tarps get shredded.  
**[1:04:09-1:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:04:09):**  Yeah.  
**[1:04:10-1:04:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:04:10):**  Yeah.  
**[1:04:11-1:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:04:11):**  You know, like it's, it's an imperfect system, you know, they all are, they all are.  
**[1:04:18-1:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:04:18):**  Exactly.  
**[1:04:19-1:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:04:19):**  And you know, so you have to make your compromises where you find them.  
**[1:04:22-1:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:04:22):**  But um, back to natural building, I mean, back to a rocket mask heaters, you know, you  
**[1:04:27-1:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:04:27):**  really can create a negative carbon system with a sustainable woodlot.  
**[1:04:33-1:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:04:33):**  You know, if you're doing coppicing or something like that, you can grow more wood mass than  
**[1:04:38-1:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:04:38):**  you use.  
**[1:04:41-1:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:04:41):**  How much space would you, I mean, these are all going to be very rough estimates, very,  
**[1:04:46-1:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:04:46):**  um, dependent on context and variation, but how much, like, let's say for your amount  
**[1:04:52-1:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:04:52):**  of use, which is quite minimal, I would imagine for the smaller spaces that you're living  
**[1:04:57-1:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:04:57):**  in and such, how much space would you need to maybe grow all of that coppice to provide  
**[1:05:01-1:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:05:01):**  for a year's consumption?  
**[1:05:03-1:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:05:03):**  Oh my goodness.  
**[1:05:04-1:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:05:04):**  For my own personal use.  
**[1:05:07-1:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:05:07):**  I wouldn't probably need more than like an acre of willow, you know, or less for my own  
**[1:05:14-1:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:05:14):**  personal use.  
**[1:05:15-1:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:05:15):**  Yeah.  
**[1:05:16-1:05:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:05:16):**  But you know, I've got a bunch of buildings around here.  
**[1:05:18-1:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:05:18):**  I've got my building and I've got, you know, the mud hut.  
**[1:05:21-1:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:05:21):**  There's two.  
**[1:05:22-1:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:05:22):**  Well, actually they're not all in use right now.  
**[1:05:25-1:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:05:25):**  But I've got 10 cabins.  
**[1:05:27-1:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:05:27):**  Let's break it down to an easier to crunch calculation.  
**[1:05:30-1:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:05:30):**  How much wood do you think you go through for your individual house in the season?  
**[1:05:36-1:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:05:36):**  My little mud hut.  
**[1:05:37-1:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:05:37):**  Oh my goodness.  
**[1:05:38-1:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:05:38):**  I go through maybe less than an eighth of a cord.  
**[1:05:41-1:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:05:41):**  Yeah.  
**[1:05:42-1:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:05:42):**  So it's really negligible.  
**[1:05:43-1:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:05:43):**  It's tiny.  
**[1:05:44-1:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:05:44):**  It's a tiny amount.  
**[1:05:45-1:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:05:45):**  You know, I really can just go out in the forest and break off a bunch of dead fall,  
**[1:05:49-1:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:05:49):**  you know, just break dead branches off and bring in a bundle of wood.  
**[1:05:53-1:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:05:53):**  You know, maybe say 12 to 18 inches in diameter by, you know, about the same long.  
**[1:06:03-1:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:03):**  That bundle will last me three days.  
**[1:06:06-1:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:06):**  Yeah.  
**[1:06:07-1:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:07):**  You know, and heat my space.  
**[1:06:08-1:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:08):**  Yeah.  
**[1:06:09-1:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:09):**  You know, that's like the size of two logs.  
**[1:06:13-1:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:13):**  Yeah.  
**[1:06:15-1:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:15):**  You know, that keeps it in perspective.  
**[1:06:17-1:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:17):**  And I mean, it goes with like this larger theme of learning to depend on the resources  
**[1:06:22-1:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:22):**  in our own immediate areas for our own needs and kind of living within those means, you  
**[1:06:27-1:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:27):**  know.  
**[1:06:28-1:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:28):**  So this is a very appropriate technology within the context that you live.  
**[1:06:31-1:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:31):**  You're close to a forest.  
**[1:06:33-1:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:33):**  And it would be all the more important to burn things that much more efficiently if  
**[1:06:36-1:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:36):**  you were in a place that had much scarcer resources for wood or higher competition for  
**[1:06:41-1:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:41):**  it within an area.  
**[1:06:42-1:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:42):**  True.  
**[1:06:43-1:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:43):**  Yeah.  
**[1:06:44-1:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:44):**  But I mean, I think that you could actually do this in cities as well.  
**[1:06:46-1:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:46):**  I mean, there's, depending on the city, of course, there's a lot of wood resource in  
**[1:06:51-1:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:51):**  a city that is currently pretty much just thrown away.  
**[1:06:54-1:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:54):**  Oh, yeah.  
**[1:06:55-1:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:55):**  To say nothing of construction waste, just to begin with.  
**[1:06:58-1:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:58):**  Yeah, right.  
**[1:06:59-1:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:59):**  Construction waste, municipal trimmings, you name it, you know.  
**[1:07:04-1:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:04):**  And you can make biomass pellets out of leaf drop.  
**[1:07:07-1:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:07):**  Sure.  
**[1:07:08-1:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:08):**  If you needed to and burn that in a rocket stove.  
**[1:07:11-1:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:11):**  Have you tried that out?  
**[1:07:12-1:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:12):**  I have not done the biomass thing, but I've seen other people who've done it really effectively.  
**[1:07:16-1:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:16):**  I would imagine it would work.  
**[1:07:17-1:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:17):**  I just haven't had the chance to try it.  
**[1:07:19-1:07:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:19):**  That's really cool.  
**[1:07:20-1:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:20):**  I mean, there's some people who have figured out how to do pellet stoves really well, you  
**[1:07:23-1:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:23):**  know, to burn pellets and rocket heaters.  
**[1:07:25-1:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:25):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[1:07:26-1:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:26):**  There's also been some pretty serious problems with that.  
**[1:07:30-1:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:30):**  Really?  
**[1:07:31-1:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:31):**  Yeah.  
**[1:07:32-1:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:32):**  There's one guy, let's see, what's the name of his YouTube channel?  
**[1:07:35-1:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:35):**  What I really like about him is he's super honest.  
**[1:07:38-1:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:38):**  Okay.  
**[1:07:39-1:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:39):**  Bigalowbrook Farms.  
**[1:07:41-1:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:41):**  He's, I forgot exactly where, but he's in a northern climate where things get really  
**[1:07:47-1:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:47):**  cold.  
**[1:07:48-1:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:48):**  He's got himself a hydroponic system or an aquaponic system.  
**[1:07:52-1:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:52):**  Yeah.  
**[1:07:53-1:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:53):**  He's got fish in a system and he's got, you know, floating plants and all that stuff.  
**[1:07:56-1:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:56):**  But to keep it all warm, he built this rocket mass heater that he feeds pellets into.  
**[1:08:02-1:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:08:02):**  Well, and it works pretty well.  
**[1:08:06-1:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:08:06):**  But one day he accidentally, he didn't realize that a bag of pellets that he poured in was  
**[1:08:11-1:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:08:11):**  wet.  
**[1:08:12-1:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:08:12):**  It had a little moisture in it.  
**[1:08:15-1:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:08:15):**  Are you there?  
**[1:08:17-1:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:08:17):**  Yeah.  
**[1:08:18-1:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:08:18):**  Yeah.  
**[1:08:19-1:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:08:19):**  And so he pours it into his hopper and walks away.  
**[1:08:22-1:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:08:22):**  Pours it, you know, lights it and walks away.  
**[1:08:26-1:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:08:26):**  And so the hopper stopped descending, it stopped feeding.  
**[1:08:31-1:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:08:31):**  So now it started smoldering up the hopper instead.  
**[1:08:36-1:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:08:36):**  And it burned the entire bag of pellets backwards and smoked out the whole place.  
**[1:08:41-1:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:08:41):**  Oh man.  
**[1:08:42-1:08:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:08:42):**  Killed a bunch of fish, killed all his plants, like wiped that place out.  
**[1:08:46-1:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:08:46):**  Yikes.  
**[1:08:47-1:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:08:47):**  Yeah.  
**[1:08:48-1:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:08:48):**  This is like the second or third horror story I've heard about using rocket stoves to heat  
**[1:08:52-1:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:08:52):**  greenhouses.  
**[1:08:53-1:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:08:53):**  Oh yeah.  
**[1:08:54-1:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:08:54):**  Yeah.  
**[1:08:55-1:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:08:55):**  Yeah.  
**[1:08:56-1:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:08:56):**  You know, like I'm not an advocate for using a rocket stove to heat greenhouses by the  
**[1:09:00-1:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:00):**  way.  
**[1:09:01-1:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:01):**  I mean, it can be done, but you know, like chickens are better.  
**[1:09:05-1:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:05):**  Fair enough.  
**[1:09:06-1:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:06):**  Yeah.  
**[1:09:07-1:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:07):**  Or like a really big compost pile.  
**[1:09:09-1:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:09):**  Yeah.  
**[1:09:10-1:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:10):**  Yeah.  
**[1:09:11-1:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:11):**  Right.  
**[1:09:12-1:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:12):**  Compost piles and all that stuff.  
**[1:09:13-1:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:13):**  Anyway.  
**[1:09:14-1:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:14):**  Fewer things that go wrong.  
**[1:09:15-1:09:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:15):**  Yeah.  
**[1:09:16-1:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:16):**  Right.  
**[1:09:17-1:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:17):**  I've seen people do or, or, or other biomass.  
**[1:09:20-1:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:20):**  I don't need to.  
**[1:09:22-1:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:22):**  But I've seen other people do it to good effect.  
**[1:09:24-1:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:24):**  Yeah.  
**[1:09:25-1:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:25):**  It seems like it's one of those areas that needs some more work, but shows some potential.  
**[1:09:29-1:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:29):**  Right.  
**[1:09:30-1:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:30):**  And I know a guy who's working on burning plastics.  
**[1:09:35-1:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:35):**  Which could be really useful in places where you have an overburden of plastic and no garbage  
**[1:09:39-1:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:39):**  pickup.  
**[1:09:40-1:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:40):**  Yeah.  
**[1:09:41-1:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:41):**  So he's trying to figure out how to burn plastics efficiently without creating PCBs and you  
**[1:09:48-1:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:48):**  know, other noxious, yeah.  
**[1:09:50-1:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:50):**  Contaminants, noxious contaminants.  
**[1:09:53-1:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:53):**  And he's getting close, I think.  
**[1:09:55-1:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:55):**  Okay.  
**[1:09:56-1:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:56):**  Well, that's promising.  
**[1:09:57-1:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:57):**  I'm going to try and keep an eye on that.  
**[1:09:58-1:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:58):**  Where in your opinion, do you still see a lot of room for improvement in these types  
**[1:10:02-1:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:10:02):**  of stones and in efficient home heating and cooking in general?  
**[1:10:07-1:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:10:07):**  Ooh, room for improvement.  
**[1:10:09-1:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:10:09):**  Well, I think the technology itself is pretty mature.  
**[1:10:14-1:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:10:14):**  The biggest room for improvement in this is communication, is our ability to communicate  
**[1:10:20-1:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:10:20):**  to the world at large that this thing works, why it works, that it's, you know what I mean?  
**[1:10:28-1:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:10:28):**  Yeah.  
**[1:10:29-1:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:10:29):**  I like it.  
**[1:10:30-1:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:10:30):**  Getting back to the larger audience.  
**[1:10:31-1:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:10:31):**  It's almost always the hardest part.  
**[1:10:32-1:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:10:32):**  Well, yeah.  
**[1:10:33-1:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:10:33):**  I mean, I can't tell you how many people I still see come to, you know, various forums  
**[1:10:38-1:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:10:38):**  here and there and say, look at this cool metal rocket stove I built.  
**[1:10:42-1:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:10:42):**  I see a lot of those too.  
**[1:10:43-1:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:10:43):**  Yeah.  
**[1:10:44-1:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:10:44):**  See a lot of them.  
**[1:10:45-1:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:10:45):**  And you know, you go, Hey man, that's a really cool thing.  
**[1:10:48-1:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:10:48):**  And I love seeing the fire in your little video, but that thing's not going to last,  
**[1:10:53-1:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:10:53):**  you know, and the comeback on that is, Oh, well you're just a hater.  
**[1:10:56-1:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:10:56):**  You know, it's like, well, no, I love your thing.  
**[1:10:58-1:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:10:58):**  It looks really cool, but you might want to align the rocket stove interior bits out of  
**[1:11:04-1:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:11:04):**  refractory material.  
**[1:11:05-1:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:11:05):**  Yeah.  
**[1:11:06-1:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:11:06):**  Yeah.  
**[1:11:07-1:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:11:07):**  I mean, I love the longevity.  
**[1:11:08-1:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:11:08):**  Yeah.  
**[1:11:09-1:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:11:09):**  But I mean, quite often those guys don't come back with a followup YouTube video that says,  
**[1:11:13-1:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:11:13):**  Oh, wow.  
**[1:11:14-1:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:11:14):**  You know, half a half a winter goes by and my heat rises gone.  
**[1:11:18-1:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:11:18):**  Let's try something else.  
**[1:11:19-1:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:11:19):**  Sure.  
**[1:11:20-1:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:11:20):**  Sure.  
**[1:11:21-1:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:11:21):**  You know?  
**[1:11:22-1:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:11:22):**  Um, so I think the improvements in this are all, I don't know, maybe I'm, I'm wrong.  
**[1:11:27-1:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:11:27):**  I'm sure there's some improvements that could be made somewhere in the physical part of  
**[1:11:31-1:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:11:31):**  this.  
**[1:11:32-1:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:11:32):**  But I think the biggest improvements I see that need to be made is in that sort of social  
**[1:11:38-1:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:11:38):**  sphere, social communication sphere, you know, much potential for production of like a self-contained  
**[1:11:48-1:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:11:48):**  unit that you could either have like a, a subcontractor install or a, an owner builder  
**[1:11:55-1:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:11:55):**  or some DIY person just kind of buy the unit and pretty simply to understand the guts or  
**[1:12:02-1:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:02):**  the interior workings just install for themselves.  
**[1:12:04-1:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:04):**  Oh yeah.  
**[1:12:05-1:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:05):**  There's a group in a, yeah, I think they're Eastern European.  
**[1:12:07-1:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:07):**  I forgot exactly what country, but it's Gamera G A M E R A after the old flying turtle, um,  
**[1:12:14-1:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:14):**  monster movies.  
**[1:12:15-1:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:15):**  Oh, okay.  
**[1:12:16-1:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:16):**  Yeah.  
**[1:12:17-1:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:17):**  Gamera Gamera.  
**[1:12:18-1:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:18):**  Anyway.  
**[1:12:19-1:12:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:19):**  Um, uh, it's a standalone kit.  
**[1:12:24-1:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:24):**  I don't think it's even a kit.  
**[1:12:25-1:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:25):**  You just buy the stove, it's set it up and then you could just plug it into your, to  
**[1:12:29-1:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:29):**  your use like thermal mass or hot water or whatever.  
**[1:12:32-1:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:32):**  Uh, it's, that's slick.  
**[1:12:35-1:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:35):**  I got to check that out.  
**[1:12:36-1:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:36):**  It's really slick.  
**[1:12:37-1:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:37):**  Yeah.  
**[1:12:38-1:12:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:38):**  It's a really cute little thing.  
**[1:12:39-1:12:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:39):**  It, it, it just comes out of the box and she stand it up.  
**[1:12:43-1:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:43):**  The interior is refractory lined.  
**[1:12:46-1:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:46):**  Mm hmm.  
**[1:12:47-1:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:47):**  Otherwise it's a metal box or a metal kind of cylinder on legs.  
**[1:12:51-1:12:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:51):**  Gotcha.  
**[1:12:52-1:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:52):**  You know, and they've done a little bit of detailing to it.  
**[1:12:56-1:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:56):**  Yeah.  
**[1:12:57-1:13:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:57):**  They've done some detailing to it, so it's not unattractive.  
**[1:13:00-1:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:13:00):**  Um, it's pretty sweet.  
**[1:13:02-1:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:13:02):**  Little essential for that outreach we're talking about.  
**[1:13:05-1:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:13:05):**  Right.  
**[1:13:06-1:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:13:06):**  Uh, and there was another group, um, called, uh, dragon stoves.  
**[1:13:11-1:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:13:11):**  You could find them online.  
**[1:13:12-1:13:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:13:12):**  I think they might have sold the business though at this point.  
**[1:13:16-1:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:13:16):**  Uh, they had a cool product, but they were having trouble with, um, yeah, I don't remember  
**[1:13:22-1:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:13:22):**  exactly why, what the glitch in their matrix was.  
**[1:13:25-1:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:13:25):**  Um, they came to the forums, actually asked a bunch of questions, built this cool little  
**[1:13:30-1:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:13:30):**  stove kit that they could send in boxes.  
**[1:13:33-1:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:13:33):**  Uh, they talked to Peter Vandenberg.  
**[1:13:35-1:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:13:35):**  It was one of the Peter Vandenberg designs.  
**[1:13:38-1:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:13:38):**  Okay.  
**[1:13:39-1:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:13:39):**  Um, it has, uh, it has a Peter channel built in and some other things.  
**[1:13:44-1:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:13:44):**  Um, it's not a bad little stove.  
**[1:13:46-1:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:13:46):**  There's some, some things that I would say need improving, but they sent me a kit, uh,  
**[1:13:51-1:13:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:13:51):**  as a thank you gift.  
**[1:13:52-1:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:13:52):**  Uh, it was cool.  
**[1:13:53-1:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:13:53):**  So that's a, yeah, so there's, there's at least two that I know of.  
**[1:13:59-1:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:13:59):**  Uh, and I know that there's some other people working on sort of a shippable core idea.  
**[1:14:04-1:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:14:04):**  Yeah.  
**[1:14:05-1:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:14:05):**  Yeah.  
**[1:14:06-1:14:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:14:06):**  Um, part to build.  
**[1:14:08-1:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:14:08):**  Yeah, right.  
**[1:14:09-1:14:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:14:09):**  The hardest part to build something that they could ship in simple pieces that could just  
**[1:14:13-1:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:14:13):**  be stacked installed and then a barrel thrown on it with, you know, build your own bench  
**[1:14:17-1:14:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:14:17):**  kind of idea.  
**[1:14:18-1:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:14:18):**  I think right now the Gamera one is the most mature.  
**[1:14:21-1:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:14:21):**  Okay.  
**[1:14:22-1:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:14:22):**  Well, I'll do my best to find links to all of this and put this in the resources for  
**[1:14:27-1:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:14:27):**  the episode.  
**[1:14:28-1:14:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:14:28):**  Um, and before we wrap up, do you have any advice for DIY folks, uh, listeners to this  
**[1:14:35-1:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:14:35):**  who want to get started building their first ones and start playing around with the potential  
**[1:14:39-1:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:14:39):**  of this?  
**[1:14:40-1:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:14:40):**  Well, yeah, I mean at risk of, at risk of repeating myself, um, you know, find a safe  
**[1:14:46-1:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:14:46):**  place out in your yard or, or in a barn with good ventilation and get started.  
**[1:14:51-1:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:14:51):**  Yeah.  
**[1:14:52-1:14:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:14:52):**  Get out there and do it, man.  
**[1:14:54-1:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:14:54):**  There's no impediment to just doing it.  
**[1:14:56-1:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:14:56):**  You know, my own experience, like worst case scenario, it's a lot of fun playing with fire.  
**[1:15:01-1:15:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:15:01):**  I mean, maybe that's the worst case scenario, but assuming you're being safe, it's just  
**[1:15:05-1:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:15:05):**  a lot of fun to play around with how to manipulate these, uh, really base kind of physics, um,  
**[1:15:13-1:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:15:13):**  of how heat thermodynamics and stuff work with really minimal materials.  
**[1:15:19-1:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:15:19):**  Like this is something you could just, uh, I think in our courses, we, we, uh, we, we  
**[1:15:22-1:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:15:22):**  were throwing these up with a bit of mud and some clay bricks and cheap clay bricks in  
**[1:15:26-1:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:15:26):**  probably a matter of 20 minutes.  
**[1:15:28-1:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:15:28):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[1:15:29-1:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:15:29):**  Oh, I mean, yeah, that's about right.  
**[1:15:31-1:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:15:31):**  I mean, really what we have at a rocket stove is it's a Fox stove above ground.  
**[1:15:37-1:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:15:37):**  Yeah.  
**[1:15:38-1:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:15:38):**  Right.  
**[1:15:39-1:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:15:39):**  So go back to the history of it.  
**[1:15:41-1:15:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:15:41):**  Look at Fox stoves, build one, look at, um, you know, uh, look at the old tin cans stove,  
**[1:15:48-1:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:15:48):**  build a couple, you know, as a test, you can just use metal stove.  
**[1:15:52-1:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:15:52):**  Pipe and cobble fabric, cobble, some garbage together and get a cool stove that will not  
**[1:15:57-1:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:15:57):**  last, but it's fun.  
**[1:15:59-1:16:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:15:59):**  Right.  
**[1:16:00-1:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:16:00):**  And you can, you can iterate changes really quickly with something like that.  
**[1:16:05-1:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:16:05):**  Exactly.  
**[1:16:06-1:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:16:06):**  That's where you get to really experiment around and try new stuff.  
**[1:16:09-1:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:16:09):**  Absolutely try new stuff.  
**[1:16:10-1:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:16:10):**  Yep.  
**[1:16:11-1:16:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:16:11):**  And, and of course go and look at the things that other people have done on the forums  
**[1:16:16-1:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:16:16):**  and, and all of that stuff, but don't be afraid to try things that other people think are  
**[1:16:20-1:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:16:20):**  dumb, you know, like I can only screw up so many ways.  
**[1:16:25-1:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:16:25):**  I can only think of so many ways to screw up.  
**[1:16:28-1:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:16:28):**  Yeah.  
**[1:16:29-1:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:16:29):**  And I've done my best learning by screwing up.  
**[1:16:33-1:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:16:33):**  So everybody find a way to screw up in a way that nobody else has figured out how to do,  
**[1:16:42-1:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:16:42):**  because that's going to teach you something about building a better stove next time.  
**[1:16:45-1:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:16:45):**  Yeah.  
**[1:16:46-1:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:16:46):**  And of course, make it safe for yourself, your family, your neighbors, do your best  
**[1:16:52-1:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:16:52):**  to be safe, but don't be afraid of experimenting and doing, you know, quote unquote dumb things.  
**[1:16:59-1:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:16:59):**  Yeah.  
**[1:17:00-1:17:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:17:00):**  You know, because that's how we all got started.  
**[1:17:02-1:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:17:02):**  We were told this wasn't possible.  
**[1:17:04-1:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:17:04):**  We were told we were doing stupid things.  
**[1:17:05-1:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:17:05):**  I was hippies over there.  
**[1:17:07-1:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:17:07):**  They're going to kill themselves.  
**[1:17:09-1:17:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:17:09):**  Well, you know, not yet.  
**[1:17:14-1:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:17:14):**  But we did some great things.  
**[1:17:18-1:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:17:18):**  That's not really the best gotcha I've heard.  
**[1:17:21-1:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:17:21):**  We haven't heard that one yet, but I'm totally in this camp, so I'm in favor of it.  
**[1:17:29-1:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:17:29):**  Right.  
**[1:17:30-1:17:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:17:30):**  You know, the point being is that we created something really cool that people said that  
**[1:17:34-1:17:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:17:34):**  couldn't be done.  
**[1:17:37-1:17:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:17:37):**  And we did it because we were willing to do dumb things.  
**[1:17:40-1:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:17:40):**  Yeah.  
**[1:17:41-1:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:17:41):**  Quote, unquote.  
**[1:17:42-1:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:17:42):**  I'm doing air quotes here.  
**[1:17:43-1:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:17:43):**  You can't see it.  
**[1:17:44-1:17:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:17:44):**  I know that's obnoxious, but, you know, dumb things.  
**[1:17:48-1:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:17:48):**  Yeah.  
**[1:17:49-1:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:17:49):**  And thinking outside of the box.  
**[1:17:51-1:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:17:51):**  Yeah.  
**[1:17:52-1:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:17:52):**  You know, and that's one of the great things about rocket stoves is that you have this  
**[1:17:56-1:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:17:56):**  combustion unit that is also separate from the use of the heat.  
**[1:18:02-1:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:18:02):**  Yeah.  
**[1:18:03-1:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:18:03):**  So, you know, once you build a combustion unit that you really like, now you can play  
**[1:18:07-1:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:18:07):**  downstream with different ways of using the heat.  
**[1:18:10-1:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:18:10):**  Oh, yeah, the implications are almost limitless once you get, you know, the basics down.  
**[1:18:16-1:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:18:16):**  Absolutely.  
**[1:18:17-1:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:18:17):**  And one of the things that we've-  
**[1:18:18-1:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:18:18):**  The crazy and dumb ideas we were talking about earlier, like hooking up a sauna to it, like,  
**[1:18:22-1:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:18:22):**  figuring out if it works.  
**[1:18:24-1:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:18:24):**  Yeah, totally.  
**[1:18:25-1:18:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:18:25):**  Well, as a general rule, I mean, here's something that hasn't gotten a lot of time and experimentation  
**[1:18:32-1:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:18:32):**  with.  
**[1:18:33-1:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:18:33):**  You know, when you have it, when you build a stove to do more than one thing at a time,  
**[1:18:38-1:18:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:18:38):**  they tend not to do any one of them well.  
**[1:18:41-1:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:18:41):**  Sure.  
**[1:18:42-1:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:18:42):**  But that isn't necessary.  
**[1:18:43-1:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:18:43):**  That doesn't have to be true.  
**[1:18:48-1:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:18:48):**  Maybe with things like bypasses, you know, which is basically a valve in the downstream,  
**[1:18:53-1:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:18:53):**  in the stream, so that you can flip it one way and the airflow, the gas flow goes one  
**[1:18:58-1:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:18:58):**  direction into, say, a hot water heater.  
**[1:18:59-1:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:18:59):**  Yep.  
**[1:19:00-1:19:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:19:00):**  And then you flip it the other way and then the gas flow can maybe go into a heat storage  
**[1:19:03-1:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:19:03):**  device for your house.  
**[1:19:04-1:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:19:04):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
**[1:19:05-1:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:19:05):**  You know, and then on that, you can flip it another way and it goes into your sauna.  
**[1:19:09-1:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:19:09):**  You know, also there's different needs and different uses of heat, like cooking tends  
**[1:19:14-1:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:19:14):**  to want a higher temperature and say heating your house tends to want to have a lower temperature  
**[1:19:18-1:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:19:18):**  and maybe you can take uses off of that.  
**[1:19:23-1:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:19:23):**  You know, there's a lot of room for innovation in how to use the heat.  
**[1:19:29-1:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:19:29):**  Mm-hmm.  
**[1:19:30-1:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:19:30):**  Yeah, and figure out what you can find out from your home experiments and post them on  
**[1:19:35-1:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:19:35):**  the forums.  
**[1:19:36-1:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:19:36):**  Yeah, yeah.

**[1:19:46-1:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:19:46):**  and inspiration from.  
**[1:19:47-1:19:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:19:47):**  So yeah, Donkey, I want to really thank you for making that such a great resource and

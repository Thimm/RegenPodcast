**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:00:00):**  This is Regenerative Skills, the podcast helping you to learn the skills and solutions to create  
**[0:00:09-0:00:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:00:09):**  an abundant and connected future.  
**[0:00:11-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:00:11):**  I'm your host, Oliver Gautier.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:00:14):**  All right, hello and welcome to the second of the monthly expert panel discussions.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:00:21):**  As I mentioned last time, each month now I'll be hosting discussions and debates between  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:00:26):**  some of the most prominent voices in regenerative agriculture, soil science, restoration land  
**[0:00:31-0:00:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:00:31):**  management, and more.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:00:32):**  If you're a subscribing Patreon member, you'll also be invited to the live events and the  
**[0:00:37-0:00:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:00:37):**  open Q&A for listeners after the panel.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:00:40):**  In today's session, I hosted a discussion on agroforestry from three distinct perspectives  
**[0:00:46-0:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:00:46):**  with my friends and colleagues at Climate Farmers, which is a non-profit organization  
**[0:00:50-0:00:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:00:50):**  working to advance regenerative agriculture in Europe.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:00:53):**  Since these discussions are longer than the regular weekly episodes, I'll keep this introduction  
**[0:00:58-0:01:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:00:58):**  short and jump right into the introductions for our three panelists.  
**[0:01:02-0:01:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:01:02):**  We have three fantastic speakers, and I'll sort of go in no particular order, starting  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:01:07):**  with Patrick Worms, who joined us actually on the last panel.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:01:11):**  Now Patrick wears many hats, including as the Senior Science Policy Advisor at World  
**[0:01:16-0:01:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:01:16):**  Agroforestry.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:01:17):**  He's the President at the European Agroforestry Federation and is a Trustee of the International  
**[0:01:22-0:01:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:01:22):**  Union of Agroforestry, also a Trustee of the International Union of Agroforestry and an  
**[0:01:28-0:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:01:28):**  Advisor to the Ecosystem Restoration Camps.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:01:31):**  Now Linda Priel.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:01:33):**  Linda has been working with Einhorn Products for over five years and is responsible for  
**[0:01:37-0:01:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:01:37):**  the fair sustainable condoms supply chain.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:01:41):**  Together with local stakeholders in Thailand, she has integrated agroforestry rubber farmers  
**[0:01:46-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:01:46):**  into Einhorn's value chain and will be speaking to us on sourcing materials from agroforestry  
**[0:01:52-0:01:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:01:52):**  outside of Europe.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:01:54):**  Now Paul Wolkbenberg.  
**[0:01:55-0:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:01:55):**  I hope I said that right.  
**[0:01:56-0:01:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:01:56):**  We talked about this from before.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:01:59):**  Paul is a physicist striving for positive environmental impact who is keen to support  
**[0:02:05-0:02:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:02:05):**  large scale transitions to a regenerative, earth friendly way of managing resources.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:02:11):**  As European Agroforestry Investment Lead at Ecosia, his goal is to demonstrate the power  
**[0:02:17-0:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:02:17):**  and potential of regeneration in agriculture.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:02:21):**  Now in this panel today, we're going to be going over three main topics being policy,  
**[0:02:27-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:02:27):**  funding, and sourcing of materials in the supply chain.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:02:32):**  Now to start us off with the policy portion, let's start with Patrick and I'll give you  
**[0:02:40-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:02:40):**  the question to start by exploring what some of the policies that are either in place now  
**[0:02:47-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:02:47):**  or that could be adopted, which could help to incentivize the adoption and expansion  
**[0:02:53-0:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:02:53):**  of agroforestry in Europe as you see it.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:02:59):**  Thank you, Oliver.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:03:00):**  You know, European policy towards agroforestry reminds me of St. Augustine's famous saying,  
**[0:03:12-0:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:03:12):**  make me abandon sin, Lord, but not just yet.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:03:18):**  And much the same thing could be said about the way the European Union is dealing with  
**[0:03:21-0:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:03:21):**  agroforestry systems.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:03:24):**  Since 2013, this is almost 10 years, at least in theory, policy in the European Union has  
**[0:03:30-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:03:30):**  carved out some space that would allow farmers to plant trees on their lands without using  
**[0:03:38-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:03:38):**  up the ability to receive the subsidies that they're used to getting.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:03:44):**  In practical terms that had no impact.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:03:47):**  And the reason why it had no impact is because these rules were buried in extremely complex  
**[0:03:51-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:03:51):**  texts and they did not come with this supporting infrastructure that would ensure that a farmer  
**[0:03:57-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:03:57):**  could engage in an agroforestry project without having to worry about what the local authorities  
**[0:04:03-0:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:04:03):**  would say.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:04:04):**  And those of you who are farmers will know, those of you who have farmers in Europe will  
**[0:04:09-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:04:09):**  know, the rules may say one thing, but in practical terms, what happens to you in terms  
**[0:04:13-0:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:04:13):**  of subsidies, in terms of the rules you have to respect, depends on a local inspectorate  
**[0:04:18-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:04:18):**  apparatus, which is not always au fait with the latest details.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:04:23):**  This has been complicated by the fact that many of these rules have carved out a role  
**[0:04:30-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:04:30):**  for the member states to take their own decisions to encourage more or encourage less the various  
**[0:04:37-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:04:37):**  regreening measures, environmental focus area measures that are foreseen in European legislation.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:04:45):**  And what that means is that sometimes inside a given country, you have to know exactly  
**[0:04:51-0:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:04:51):**  where you stand in Germany, in France, in Belgium, for example, the rules about supporting  
**[0:04:56-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:04:56):**  agroforestry change depending on the department, the state or the region in which you find  
**[0:05:02-0:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:05:02):**  yourselves.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:05:03):**  Finally, you have a thicket of measures at national and regional and local level, which  
**[0:05:09-0:05:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:05:09):**  can make life difficult if you engage in agroforestry.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:05:12):**  I know of one case in Vlaanderen, the northern part of Belgium, where the farmer used these  
**[0:05:19-0:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:05:19):**  openings and this European policy measures to plant some trees, in his case, it was poplars  
**[0:05:24-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:05:24):**  in a silver pastoral system.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:05:26):**  And at the end of the rotation, of course, the objective was to harvest these poplars  
**[0:05:30-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:05:30):**  and sell the timber.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:05:32):**  He was prevented from doing so because by then the local borrow, the municipality, had  
**[0:05:39-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:05:39):**  slapped the preservation order on his trees, on the grounds that they were beautiful and  
**[0:05:44-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:05:44):**  therefore worth preserving, but without compensating him for the loss of his income.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:05:48):**  The result of that has, of course, been an absolute disaster, not just for that particular  
**[0:05:52-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:05:52):**  farmer.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:05:53):**  In the region, the farmers got the message loud and clear, don't plant trees.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:05:58):**  It's nothing but trouble.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:06:00):**  And that brings me to the core of what we need here.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:06:03):**  The details I have now, I have 10 tabs open on my other screen, which contain details  
**[0:06:08-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:06:08):**  of various parts of European legislation and how they support or don't support agroforestry.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:06:15):**  The problem with it is first, I need 10 different tabs to have them open.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:06:19):**  Second, in order to give them to you, I'd have to reread them carefully because it's  
**[0:06:22-0:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:06:22):**  complicated.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:06:24):**  And third, farmers don't have the time to do that.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:06:28):**  Farmers require something which is clear and they require support, which tells them that  
**[0:06:33-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:06:33):**  if they engage in an agroforestry activity, that the presumption of innocence is on their  
**[0:06:40-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:06:40):**  side, whereas today in too many countries, the presumption of suspicion is on their side.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:06:46):**  And let's remember what that means for a farmer.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:06:48):**  If somebody decides that you are misusing the rules in some way, not only can you use  
**[0:06:52-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:06:52):**  your pillar one payments, your primary subsidies, but even worse, if you're really unlucky,  
**[0:06:58-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:06:58):**  they might decide it's not agricultural land anymore and reclassified as forestry land.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:07:03):**  And that comes under a completely different segment of European legislation, which has  
**[0:07:08-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:07:08):**  a direct impact on the price of that land.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:07:11):**  So you've not only lost a little bit of subsidies on a yearly basis, but you've also lost a  
**[0:07:16-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:07:16):**  significant part of your capital.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:07:18):**  Not surprisingly, farmers are going to look long and hard at these problems before they  
**[0:07:22-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:07:22):**  decide that the benefits are worth it.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:07:26):**  Final points, there's a cultural issue.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:07:30):**  The places that are in most dire need of agroforestry are those places which have no trees whatsoever.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:07:36):**  I'm thinking, for example, of the Picardie in France or the Artois in France, lands which  
**[0:07:41-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:07:41):**  are very rich, which are very productive and where you practically have no trees any longer,  
**[0:07:45-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:07:45):**  certainly no hedges.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:07:47):**  In those environments, farmers will find it difficult, no matter what the policy support  
**[0:07:51-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:07:51):**  is, to actually engage in agroforestry because nobody knows what it is, their neighbors aren't  
**[0:07:55-0:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:07:55):**  doing it, they cannot taste it by themselves.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:07:59):**  The opposite thing happens in parts of Iberia, Italy or Greece, which have always been agroforestry,  
**[0:08:06-0:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:08:06):**  the montadas, the dehesas, these sorts of systems.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:08:09):**  And when you tell people that there is agroforestry and they should encourage it, they look at  
**[0:08:14-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:08:14):**  you and say, it's just farming, what do you mean it's agroforestry?  
**[0:08:17-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:08:17):**  And so there is this definition, there is this difference in the way that people perceive  
**[0:08:21-0:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:08:21):**  the same systems, depending on the cultural environment in which they find themselves.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:08:28):**  Now the European Commission, to give them full credit, they are neither idiots nor corrupt  
**[0:08:34-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:08:34):**  bastards, they are fine people who are trying to do a really, really good job.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:08:38):**  To give them credit, they recognize these difficulties and they try to model and to  
**[0:08:44-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:08:44):**  shape agricultural policy in a way that gives the maximum freedom to this.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:08:49):**  And in the currently debated reform of the cap, which will with a bit of luck come into  
**[0:08:53-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:08:53):**  force in 2022, the idea is that it's up to the member states to decide how to shape the  
**[0:09:00-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:09:00):**  system.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:09:01):**  The European Union gives them broad brush indications about what agricultural policy  
**[0:09:06-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:09:06):**  should achieve and a pile of money to pay the subsidies, but it's then up to the member  
**[0:09:10-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:09:10):**  states to decide what to do in their so-called strategic plans.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:09:14):**  And I know that a number of you are based in Germany and there I would like to finish  
**[0:09:19-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:09:19):**  this part of my intervention by highlighting the role of good lobbying.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:09:24):**  The Bundestag, the German parliament, passed just a couple of weeks ago a measure in parliament  
**[0:09:32-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:09:32):**  calling on the government to use the opportunity of these strategic plans to put in place a  
**[0:09:38-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:09:38):**  strong promotional system to encourage the adoption of agroforestry elsewhere.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:09:44):**  What's really interesting about this is that this is a measure that was supported across  
**[0:09:49-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:09:49):**  the board in that parliament from the extreme left to the extreme right, from the parties  
**[0:09:54-0:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:09:54):**  that are in the governing coalitions to the parties that are in opposition.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:09:58):**  As far as I'm aware, the only ones who voted against it were the liberals for the same  
**[0:10:01-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:10:01):**  stupid reason, liberty, freedom, farmers to do what they want.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:10:06):**  But apart from that, the socialists, the conservatives, the Greens, everybody voted in favour of that  
**[0:10:11-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:10:11):**  measure.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:10:12):**  And that's an influence that should be taken to heart by member states in the rest of Europe.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:10:19):**  Because if governments take that kind of approach seriously and put in place the right support  
**[0:10:24-0:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:10:24):**  mechanisms to encourage agroforestry to be adopted, then assuming the extension services  
**[0:10:30-0:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:10:30):**  follow suit, assuming the research into agroforestry system follows suit, assuming the consumers  
**[0:10:37-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:10:37):**  demand regeneratively raised products, then a significant proportion of farmers will start  
**[0:10:42-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:10:42):**  moving in that direction.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:10:45):**  So I'm wondering from your perspective as well, Patrick, if government policies are  
**[0:10:50-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:10:50):**  really where we should be looking to help to shape the future of agroforestry and land  
**[0:10:55-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:10:55):**  management practices at large, or are there more effective ways to encourage best practices  
**[0:11:00-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:11:00):**  outside of governing bodies?  
**[0:11:02-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:11:02):**  It's an interesting question.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:11:05):**  Very often in Europe, I rage against the common agricultural policy and just dream of a day  
**[0:11:12-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:11:12):**  when all these subsidies fall away, when people have the full freedom to do what they like.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:11:18):**  And that's a situation that's not very unlike the one that prevails in the United States,  
**[0:11:24-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:11:24):**  where landowners are broadly allowed to do whatever the hell they like with their land.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:11:29):**  And so you find that there's more innovation in terms of crop rotation, no till, and even  
**[0:11:35-0:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:11:35):**  agroforestry in the United States, and it's sometimes the case in Europe.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:11:39):**  However, we are where we are, and farmers need to be encouraged within the institutional  
**[0:11:46-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:11:46):**  constraints that we have.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:11:48):**  And from that perspective, that really means three things.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:11:52):**  The first thing that it means is that governments need to make it absolutely clear.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:11:57):**  They need to carve a bubble of freedom around what farmers do on their lands.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:12:01):**  They need to make it absolutely clear that a farmer is allowed to experiment with agroforestry  
**[0:12:06-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:12:06):**  on his or her land, using whichever density of whichever tree species in whichever mix  
**[0:12:12-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:12:12):**  he or she thinks is likely to deliver the objectives he's looking for.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:12:17):**  And that it should not be, he or she should not be penalized for that and certainly should  
**[0:12:21-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:12:21):**  not use subsidies or agricultural land classification as a result of that.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:12:26):**  The second thing that states need to do is to understand that farmers need knowledge  
**[0:12:33-0:12:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:12:33):**  and advice.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:12:34):**  Farmers know their land better than anybody else because they work that particular piece  
**[0:12:37-0:12:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:12:37):**  of land, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they know everything there is to know  
**[0:12:43-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:12:43):**  about how to manage that land as productively and as sustainably as possible.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:12:47):**  They do need advice.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:12:48):**  And right now in the rich world, the advisory systems that we have are largely controlled  
**[0:12:53-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:12:53):**  by the agrochemical industry who fund a lot of the work that's being done in the universities,  
**[0:12:58-0:13:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:12:58):**  who fund a lot of the extension services, and of course, who provide advice through  
**[0:13:03-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:13:03):**  the farm good shop, the farm good stores, the shops where farmers go to equip themselves  
**[0:13:08-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:13:08):**  with the tools and the inputs that they need to carry out their business.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:13:12):**  It's extremely easy to get advice on how to use fertilizers, on how to use pesticides,  
**[0:13:16-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:13:16):**  on how to use seeds, on how to repair your tractor, and how to mechanize something.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:13:20):**  It's very, very hard to get good advice on what to do with agroforestry.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:13:25):**  The private sector cannot be expected to pick that up for a simple reason.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:13:29):**  If you, Oliver, have 200 hectares of wheat in Germany and I am Syngenta or Bayer or whoever,  
**[0:13:35-0:13:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:13:35):**  I'm going to be making somewhere between 50 and 100 euros a year per hectare from your  
**[0:13:40-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:13:40):**  land.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:13:41):**  This is a business that's controlled by half a dozen large companies around the world,  
**[0:13:44-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:13:44):**  which means all of the commercial farmland around the world is paying that kind of profit  
**[0:13:49-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:13:49):**  to these companies every year.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:13:51):**  That's tens of billions of dollars in profit, a lot of which is reinvested in marketing  
**[0:13:55-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:13:55):**  and lobbying.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:13:56):**  If instead I launch a consultancy business, first, let's suppose you're in an environment  
**[0:14:02-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:14:02):**  in which nobody's ever done agroforestry before, you're going to have to decide to do something  
**[0:14:06-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:14:06):**  unusual, which is to hire an agroforestry consultant.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:14:09):**  My marketing costs are going to be very high because it's simply going to the shop to buy  
**[0:14:13-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:14:13):**  my products as an agroforestry advisor.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:14:16):**  I am going to have to convince you to hire me.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:14:18):**  Second, since you don't know much about it, you're not going to be paying me what you  
**[0:14:22-0:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:14:22):**  would pay a consultant from McKinsey.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:14:23):**  You're not going to pay me 2000 euros a day.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:14:25):**  You're going to pay me 500 euros a day, maybe if I'm lucky.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:14:29):**  And after three days, we'll be good because this is not rocket science.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:14:33):**  Once you understand the basic principles and we've looked at your maps and we've looked  
**[0:14:37-0:14:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:14:37):**  at your soils, you will know roughly what to plant, where to plant it.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:14:41):**  And maybe over the coming years, you'll need to call me every once in a while to solve  
**[0:14:45-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:14:45):**  a problem.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:14:46):**  So basically, instead of making 20,000 euros a year from your farm, I'm making 1500 euros  
**[0:14:52-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:14:52):**  once from your farm.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:14:53):**  There is no way this business can work.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:14:56):**  And that is why around Europe, so few companies, so few for profit companies manage to make  
**[0:15:01-0:15:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:15:01):**  money from advising on agroforestry.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:15:05):**  Most of the ones who do like Pure Project in France, for example, still get a lot of  
**[0:15:09-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:15:09):**  public subsidies in one way or another.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:15:11):**  So you need the private sector, the public sector to recognize that this is a problem  
**[0:15:17-0:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:15:17):**  and to pay for this advice to be developed across the extension services and to be made  
**[0:15:22-0:15:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:15:22):**  available to the farmers.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:15:24):**  If you do that, then the farmers will become exposed to this idea.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:15:29):**  They will become socialized to this idea.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:15:32):**  And the younger farmers in particular, those who are not yet set in their ways, are going  
**[0:15:37-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:15:37):**  to start experimenting with this.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:15:38):**  And the way this works is always the same.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:15:41):**  Farmers will start doing it on five or 10 or 20 percent of their land.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:15:44):**  They'll try it out.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:15:45):**  They'll fairly rapidly begin to see that this has certain benefits, especially, for example,  
**[0:15:49-0:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:15:49):**  if it's a drought year and you're doing fine, but your neighbors are not any longer.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:15:53):**  And then you spread it across the rest of your land.  
**[0:15:55-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:15:55):**  And then you have social diffusion mechanisms happening, because the farmer who is being  
**[0:15:59-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:15:59):**  successful because he's added trees to his field, at first is the subject of derision  
**[0:16:05-0:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:16:05):**  from his neighbors.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:16:06):**  But after a few years, when he's the one who's doing well, who's got more resilience, who's  
**[0:16:11-0:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:16:11):**  got different income streams, he's the farmer who is going to be encouraging his neighbors  
**[0:16:15-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:16:15):**  and who is going to be copied by his neighbors.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:16:18):**  Of course, this mechanism of social diffusion in Europe is suppressed by the policy of the  
**[0:16:22-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:16:22):**  subsidy regime that I've already discussed.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:16:25):**  But you see it in action in environments in which these constraints simply do not exist.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:16:30):**  And the prime example there is probably Niger in the Sahel in West Africa, where farmers  
**[0:16:35-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:16:35):**  have regenerated over 10 million hectares of agroforestry parklands, not because, not  
**[0:16:42-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:16:42):**  as a result of a subsidy or even a result of advice, but because without the trees,  
**[0:16:46-0:16:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:16:46):**  nothing grows.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:16:47):**  With the trees, you might get a crop.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:16:49):**  Without the trees, it's, you know, the local climate is simply such that it's very, very  
**[0:16:53-0:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:16:53):**  hard to grow anything at all.  
**[0:16:55-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:16:55):**  So but in Europe, we are cursed.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:17:00):**  We are cursed by fantastic soils, which are of great quality.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:17:04):**  You can mishandle these soils for decades before you start paying the consequence.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:17:10):**  And we are cursed by all these subsidies.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:17:12):**  So farmers can continue to do suboptimal management, which is costing a lot of money in inputs  
**[0:17:22-0:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:17:22):**  and generating a lot of negative externalities without suffering any of the negative consequences  
**[0:17:26-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:17:26):**  of that.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:17:29):**  Thank you, Patrick.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:17:30):**  I'd like to throw it now to Paul.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:17:31):**  Paul, could you give us a perspective on how you've come to work with or against some of  
**[0:17:36-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:17:36):**  the policies in the projects that you are helping to advance of agroforestry in Europe?  
**[0:17:42-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:17:42):**  Yeah, sure.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:17:43):**  I mean, let me maybe just give one small note.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:17:47):**  I'm not sure if everyone is aware of that, why funding is such a big issue, especially  
**[0:17:52-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:17:52):**  for agroforestry.  
**[0:17:55-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:17:55):**  So we are speaking about planting trees here that will take a number of years to bear fruit.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:18:01):**  And even if we plant very quick bearing trees, those will be at least four to five years.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:18:09):**  But in most cases for agroforestry systems that we would like to see, we can we speak  
**[0:18:15-0:18:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:18:15):**  more about 10, 15, 20 years to have a full production going.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:18:20):**  And so that means that any system we want to establish needs really high upfront costs.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:18:25):**  So high investment in the beginning for planting those trees, for maintaining those trees,  
**[0:18:29-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:18:29):**  for watering them, all the work that goes into that will only be, let's say, refinanced  
**[0:18:38-0:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:18:38):**  after 10 to 20 years.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:18:40):**  So this sort of, let's say, this bet in a way, because for most farmers, it really seems  
**[0:18:47-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:18:47):**  like a bet.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:18:48):**  They don't recognise yet that there is a guaranteed benefit in it for them.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:18:54):**  This bet seems like a really high risk.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:18:57):**  And therefore, we need both through subsidies, but also through investments, because not  
**[0:19:04-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:19:04):**  every farmer has that money just sitting around in his bank account.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:19:09):**  We need money made available for these sort of establishments of agroforestry.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:19:16):**  And this is just one short sentence on Nicosia.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:19:21):**  This is what we started doing.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:19:22):**  We basically proposed financial partnerships to farmers who want to establish agroforestry  
**[0:19:28-0:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:19:28):**  systems and do it in a way that they can bridge this time until the agroforest starts to bear  
**[0:19:37-0:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:19:37):**  fruit.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:19:38):**  So, coming to the policy, of course, policy and subsidy going hand in hand, it's in Europe,  
**[0:19:44-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:19:44):**  it's a major topic, right?  
**[0:19:45-0:19:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:19:45):**  So there are very few farms in Europe that, even conventional farms, that are profitable  
**[0:19:51-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:19:51):**  without subsidies.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:19:53):**  It more or less doesn't exist.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:19:56):**  So we need, I mean, the farmers are used to and they need the subsidies.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:20:02):**  And what we have encountered, and it confirms everything that Patrick just says, so farmers  
**[0:20:15-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:20:15):**  cannot and won't go through the jungle of laws and, let's say, adaptations of European  
**[0:20:24-0:20:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:20:24):**  ideas that exist in different regions, right?  
**[0:20:29-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:20:29):**  Because in Germany, for example, we have to speak about the federal state and every federal  
**[0:20:34-0:20:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:20:34):**  state has its own rules regarding how to deal with agroforestry ideas.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:20:44):**  And so it's extremely complicated.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:20:46):**  At the moment, there's no public incentive to do agroforestry.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:20:50):**  It's a no-go.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:20:53):**  It's really difficult.  
**[0:20:55-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:20:55):**  And yeah, so we are experiencing that in all our projects.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:21:01):**  It's not sometimes or a little bit, it's everywhere.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:21:06):**  We have found a couple of ways around.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:21:10):**  So basically, you find a niche that works.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:21:17):**  So I can just give an example.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:21:20):**  Walnuts, for example, you can plant walnuts, but then you cannot do anything under them.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:21:25):**  So you're by no means think about integrating walnuts with, I don't know, willows or poplar  
**[0:21:33-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:21:33):**  or other things that could protect the trees from against wind or could just make a slightly  
**[0:21:39-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:21:39):**  more complex, slightly more interesting system.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:21:41):**  All of that is impossible.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:21:44):**  But if you just plant walnut trees, then you can get that subsidized, at least in Germany  
**[0:21:50-0:21:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:21:50):**  and in most parts in Europe.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:21:53):**  So there are simple things that work.  
**[0:21:55-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:21:55):**  But what we would like to see as agroforestry system and the type of systems that would  
**[0:22:00-0:22:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:22:00):**  really unfold all the advantages of agroforestry, it's impossible to get them subsidized.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:22:06):**  Yeah, that sounds like quite a challenge.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:22:09):**  Now, Linda, from your perspective, from the supply side, trying to source products, have  
**[0:22:14-0:22:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:22:14):**  you found any policies that incentivize this from the business end or that make it easier  
**[0:22:21-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:22:21):**  to find products either in Europe or abroad based on the policies that exist from businesses?  
**[0:22:29-0:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:22:29):**  No, to answer this question shortly, not from a business side.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:22:35):**  Just to give you a short introduction.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:22:38):**  So I'm working for Einhorn and we are producing condoms in Malaysia and the rubber for this  
**[0:22:44-0:22:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:22:44):**  condoms comes from Thailand.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:22:47):**  And while we were looking for sustainable rubber, whatever that means, we found out  
**[0:22:53-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:22:53):**  about a group of farmers in southern Thailand who are growing rubber in agroforestry systems.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:23:01):**  And we were trying to we said, well, this is what we would call truly sustainable.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:23:07):**  And we would like to integrate those into our value chain.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:23:10):**  And we didn't know of any other example who had done this in the rubber world before.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:23:17):**  And we were trying to look for how can we like where would we get support from to do  
**[0:23:21-0:23:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:23:21):**  this?  
**[0:23:22-0:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:23:22):**  But also what is like the local realities in Thailand?  
**[0:23:24-0:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:23:24):**  So I can't really talk so much about Europe.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:23:26):**  And I'm learning a lot today.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:23:28):**  It's really interesting from you.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:23:30):**  But from like from a business perspective, like how Einhorn was encouraged to do this,  
**[0:23:37-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:23:37):**  I didn't know of any support.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:23:39):**  I know that there was some support for the farmers to do this way of growing, but it  
**[0:23:45-0:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:23:45):**  wasn't directed to any supply chain connection.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:23:50):**  Well for that reason, let's quickly move on to the funding side and we'll focus on Paul  
**[0:23:53-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:23:53):**  for a minute when I come back to you, Linda, when we talk more about your work and the  
**[0:23:58-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:23:58):**  business side of agroforestry.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:24:00):**  So Paul, you had just mentioned some of the challenges and difficulties of navigating  
**[0:24:05-0:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:24:05):**  the policy side of implementing agroforestry systems here in Europe.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:24:10):**  But I'm wondering that since there are very few initiatives that ever get the funding  
**[0:24:14-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:24:14):**  that they want to implement their goals, careful priorities, of course, need to be set for  
**[0:24:19-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:24:19):**  the actions and the tools that are most effective.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:24:23):**  And when it comes to advancing agroforestry here in Europe, where do you see these priorities  
**[0:24:28-0:24:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:24:28):**  and these most effective steps?  
**[0:24:31-0:24:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:24:31):**  I think there are three, let's say three levels set by prioritizing the projects that we fund.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:24:42):**  Two of them, Patrick has already talked a lot about, so I won't go too much into that  
**[0:24:46-0:24:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:24:46):**  in one.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:24:47):**  So those are doing basically teaching and getting information to the farmers.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:24:57):**  And the second one is to do lobby work, to set the policies right, to get associations  
**[0:25:03-0:25:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:25:03):**  going in the different countries and get them reunited, to put pressure on decision-takers.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:25:11):**  So these are two levers, I think, that are important.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:25:15):**  But the one that the third one that we are more focusing on at the moment and which I  
**[0:25:21-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:25:21):**  think is also very powerful is to get projects funded that, let's say, heave agroforestry  
**[0:25:29-0:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:25:29):**  out of a niche and into the mainstream.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:25:32):**  So to really establish pilot projects with very high visibility and a multiplication  
**[0:25:40-0:25:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:25:40):**  effect in their region and beyond.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:25:46):**  I personally believe that this inspiration is something that is very powerful amongst  
**[0:25:51-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:25:51):**  farmers, like something that spreads quickly.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:25:57):**  And the bound also to the thing I just said about the time delay between funding a project  
**[0:26:07-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:26:07):**  today and then bearing fruit and being really productive implies that the projects we are  
**[0:26:14-0:26:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:26:14):**  looking at today, the ones that are impacting decision-takers today, the ones that are being  
**[0:26:20-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:26:20):**  shown in videos and say that are serving as examples, those are from pioneers and visionaries  
**[0:26:28-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:26:28):**  that started a long time before everyone else, that went against the mainstream and planted  
**[0:26:34-0:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:26:34):**  trees despite all those innovative factors.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:26:39):**  So these are scattered really a bit all over the world.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:26:44):**  They are a bit, they are few in every country, but then in no way really united or have a  
**[0:26:51-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:26:51):**  visibility at a larger scale.  
**[0:26:54-0:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:26:54):**  And therefore, what we try to do is to identify farms in, let's say, in hotspots where they  
**[0:27:02-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:27:02):**  could really have a large impact on surrounding farms and that also provide a certain scalability.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:27:09):**  So where we don't speak about, okay, a few hectares, a forest garden run by a small private  
**[0:27:18-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:27:18):**  initiative of a couple of people who just like this topic and that they would like to  
**[0:27:24-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:27:24):**  express themselves in their, yeah, in the few hectares that are available to them.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:27:32):**  That's something great and we love seeing that, but we believe that, let's say, the  
**[0:27:37-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:27:37):**  larger impact in this Europe wide or global transition to agroforestry can only be really  
**[0:27:44-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:27:44):**  successful if also large farms switch.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:27:48):**  And so we need to address those large farms and that's a very difficult task.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:27:57):**  So we are, for example, dealing with a farm in Eastern Germany, 5,700 hectares, a lot  
**[0:28:06-0:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:28:06):**  of biogas, a lot of milk cows conventionally run until now being transitioned to organic  
**[0:28:14-0:28:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:28:14):**  at the moment.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:28:15):**  And we addressed them and said, hey, why don't you go a step beyond organic and start agroforestry?  
**[0:28:23-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:28:23):**  And we brought in the different experts from the German Association of Agroforestry and  
**[0:28:28-0:28:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:28:28):**  started the discussion, got them a little bit excited, asked them what they would like  
**[0:28:33-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:28:33):**  and well, didn't get as far as we wanted to, but we at least planted two hectares of agroforestry  
**[0:28:42-0:28:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:28:42):**  this winter with the promise and the potential of scaling that up to a much larger system.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:28:51):**  And the main effect actually of this exercise was that these farmers now are keen to learn  
**[0:28:59-0:29:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:28:59):**  more.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:29:00):**  They're interested.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:29:01):**  And what I just learned recently, they even when they were asked about their opinion,  
**[0:29:07-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:29:07):**  because they're also well connected to the political sphere, when they were asked about  
**[0:29:10-0:29:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:29:10):**  their opinion on agroforestry in the preparation work that was being done, obviously, for this  
**[0:29:17-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:29:17):**  meeting that Patrick just referred to and the voting, they actually expressed their  
**[0:29:24-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:29:24):**  strong support for agroforestry.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:29:28):**  So that's great.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:29:29):**  You know, then we did a good job, I think, if this type of people support agroforestry,  
**[0:29:37-0:29:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:29:37):**  despite not even having done it themselves.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:29:39):**  And they're just, you know, they're just getting started, but they're already so excited that  
**[0:29:45-0:29:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:29:45):**  they are keen to support it.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:29:50):**  So yeah, I think to answer the question, George, we need to focus on visible, scalable and  
**[0:29:59-0:30:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:29:59):**  much pickable farms.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:30:02):**  I think you're absolutely right, Paul, but I would I would add something else to that.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:30:06):**  I think we have to train the eye of policymakers to see Europe is full of agroforestry, but  
**[0:30:12-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:30:12):**  even the people who are doing that don't realize they're doing agroforestry.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:30:16):**  Whenever you are in a landscape that has hedges or windbreaks or woodlots, or you see animals  
**[0:30:21-0:30:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:30:21):**  grazing under trees, all those are forms of agroforestry.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:30:26):**  And very often people don't realize what they're seeing.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:30:29):**  Then people sometimes are stuck mentally in too restrictive a vision.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:30:34):**  In Eastern Germany, for example, you have these large farms, which are the privatized  
**[0:30:39-0:30:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:30:39):**  old communal farms of the East German system.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:30:43):**  You do have a fair amount of agroforestry, but it usually takes the form of energy coppice  
**[0:30:48-0:30:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:30:48):**  systems.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:30:49):**  So you have willow and hazel and so on, which are grown in large bands and wheat systems  
**[0:30:53-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:30:53):**  and then harvested for bioenergy.  
**[0:30:55-0:30:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:30:55):**  It's fine.  
**[0:30:56-0:31:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:30:56):**  It's a form of agroforestry, but people tend to think that it is the only form of agroforestry  
**[0:31:00-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:31:00):**  there is.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:31:01):**  So in addition to encouraging people to consider agroforestry by focusing on these marquee  
**[0:31:09-0:31:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:31:09):**  farmers, these pioneer farmers, there is this need to tell the story of all the agroforestry  
**[0:31:15-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:31:15):**  that already exists.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:31:17):**  If you look at the studies that have been done, you find that on 5% of European agricultural  
**[0:31:22-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:31:22):**  land there's already more than 10% tree cover, that's agroforestry.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:31:26):**  It's already out there.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:31:27):**  But yet it's not recognized as agroforestry, either in national or in European legislation.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:31:32):**  Finally, just to get back to that point you made that you talked well to these farmers  
**[0:31:36-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:31:36):**  and when there were politicians asked them what they wanted to do, they said, yeah, let's  
**[0:31:40-0:31:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:31:40):**  support it.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:31:41):**  That happens at various levels.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:31:42):**  It happened in the Czech Republic just a couple of years ago.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:31:45):**  The Czech Agroforestry Association organized a day long meeting to discuss the benefits  
**[0:31:49-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:31:49):**  of agroforestry for the Czech Republic, invited half a dozen European agroforestors, including  
**[0:31:54-0:31:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:31:54):**  myself to come and talk about it, make sure that the TV was there, that the newspapers  
**[0:31:59-0:32:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:31:59):**  was there and that had two impacts.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:32:01):**  The first was my mom-in-law, my wife is Czech, my mom-in-law called me that evening and said,  
**[0:32:05-0:32:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:32:05):**  hey, I saw you on TV, which was great.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:32:07):**  But the second and far more important impact is that two weeks later the Minister of Agriculture  
**[0:32:14-0:32:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:32:14):**  went on the evening news to explain that because of climate change it was important to build  
**[0:32:18-0:32:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:32:18):**  up resilience in Czech agriculture and that agroforestry was a prime way of doing this.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:32:24):**  So I completely subscribe to what you're saying.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:32:27):**  The more you can meet the right people and get them to understand the beauty of these  
**[0:32:31-0:32:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:32:31):**  systems, the more likely it is that they will in turn impact the wider institutional and  
**[0:32:37-0:32:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:32:37):**  political environment in which these systems can thrive.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:32:40):**  Brilliant.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:32:41):**  I want to throw now to Linda who coming from the business side of things has found unique  
**[0:32:46-0:32:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:32:46):**  ways of incentivizing sustainable agroforestry in those areas of Thailand like you described  
**[0:32:51-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:32:51):**  earlier.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:32:52):**  And I could give a little summary of it, but I think you would do it better than me about  
**[0:32:55-0:33:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:32:55):**  how you reached out to these people and through economic incentives.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:33:00):**  I believe you've helped to grow the network of people who are managing their land in this  
**[0:33:04-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:33:04):**  way and sourcing directly by cutting out middlemen from the rubber that you source for the products  
**[0:33:10-0:33:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:33:10):**  of Einhorn.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:33:11):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:33:12):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:33:13):**  I was sorry when you were talking, I was the whole time thinking, yeah, but like, you know,  
**[0:33:16-0:33:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:33:16):**  like making it visible and making it larger.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:33:19):**  It's interesting to see that like we have started working with this farmers and I'm  
**[0:33:23-0:33:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:33:23):**  like in this rubber world where everything is in monocultures and the tire industry is  
**[0:33:28-0:33:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:33:28):**  the biggest supplier of natural rubber.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:33:31):**  Not supplier, demanding the most of it.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:33:36):**  Everyone is all the time saying yes, but you can't do it and it's not economically and  
**[0:33:41-0:33:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:33:41):**  you can't do it.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:33:42):**  And now like showing from a business perspective that it does make sense and it can be done  
**[0:33:49-0:33:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:33:49):**  and it can be implemented and you can build up supply chains and sourcing from it.  
**[0:33:54-0:34:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:33:54):**  You can also shift the conversation of the demand side and saying, well, you're caring  
**[0:34:00-0:34:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:34:00):**  about sustainability and you want to change something.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:34:03):**  So go and look for different sources, what you might have not considered so far.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:34:08):**  And so coming back to the question, Oliver, what we did was there was a group of 10 farmers  
**[0:34:16-0:34:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:34:16):**  in southern Thailand growing rubber in agroforestry systems.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:34:21):**  And through the university there was doing lots of research on it.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:34:25):**  I got to know them and was really thrilled of seeing their diverse system, how they grew  
**[0:34:31-0:34:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:34:31):**  rubber or how they're growing rubber.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:34:33):**  And so the challenge was to find the person in between who would, because rubber is tapped  
**[0:34:40-0:34:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:34:40):**  every second day and it's liquid latex coming out of the trees and then it has to be collected  
**[0:34:46-0:34:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:34:46):**  really quickly until it's processed and then goes to the condom manufacturing.  
**[0:34:53-0:34:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:34:53):**  And so finding this person in between who would go and work with those farmers to collect  
**[0:34:58-0:35:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:34:58):**  it separately, not mixing it up with monoculture rubber and working with these farmers on implementing  
**[0:35:06-0:35:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:35:06):**  collection points, on setting up systems so they can do their own quality control of the  
**[0:35:11-0:35:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:35:11):**  latex.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:35:13):**  So this is all work we did together to see what infrastructure do we need to build to  
**[0:35:18-0:35:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:35:18):**  support those farmers to be able to sell their latex as a premium latex, as an agroforestry  
**[0:35:25-0:35:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:35:25):**  latex and not as the major mix of monoculture latex, which is there otherwise.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:35:33):**  And through this we empowered them to be able to control the quality and everything themselves.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:35:43):**  And at the same time cutting out those middlemen who were previously collecting it from them.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:35:50):**  And what Einon is doing, we are paying a premium for the work they do and we are also  
**[0:35:55-0:35:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:35:55):**  investing into this, setting up all this infrastructure.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:35:59):**  And by now we are inspiring other condom brands who have addressed us and said, hey, can we  
**[0:36:05-0:36:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:36:05):**  source your latex?  
**[0:36:06-0:36:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:36:06):**  We want to use agroforestry latex.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:36:08):**  And we said, yeah, cool.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:36:10):**  As long as we get more farmers and they can inspire each other and we are now trying to  
**[0:36:15-0:36:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:36:15):**  set up a nursery and trying to grow this group to make it bigger to increase the impact.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:36:22):**  It is inspiring already, although it's like in Southern Thailand and it's only a limited  
**[0:36:29-0:36:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:36:29):**  located area.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:36:30):**  But if it works there, it might be applied in other areas as well in the future.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:36:36):**  Brilliant.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:36:37):**  And now before we wrap up this topic on funding of agroforestry, I want to throw back to Paul  
**[0:36:41-0:36:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:36:41):**  to talk about if you've been able to find the metrics based on the success stories and  
**[0:36:46-0:36:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:36:46):**  the places that you've worked with to get an idea about this initial investment.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:36:51):**  I know you said you were working with planting walnuts in an agroforestry system in France.  
**[0:36:56-0:37:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:36:56):**  Do you have numbers as to what the startup costs might look like, what the returns could  
**[0:37:01-0:37:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:37:01):**  look like over time, or just to give people an idea of the type of money that needs to  
**[0:37:06-0:37:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:37:06):**  be raised to get started?  
**[0:37:08-0:37:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:37:08):**  Yeah, actually across different systems, if we are speaking about fruit bearing systems,  
**[0:37:14-0:37:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:37:14):**  like  
**[0:37:17-0:37:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:37:17):**  apple trees or other types of fruits, we often see business cases that need at least about  
**[0:37:27-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:37:27):**  10,000 euros per hectare as establishment costs, so including the plantation and the maintenance,  
**[0:37:37-0:37:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:37:37):**  etc. for the first couple of years.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:37:40):**  And then the, let's say the, that includes already the, let's say, the compensation you  
**[0:37:49-0:37:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:37:49):**  get to some extent from subsidies in those first years.  
**[0:37:54-0:38:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:37:54):**  And then when you speak about the return, let's say when the fruit starts to bear, typically  
**[0:38:02-0:38:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:38:02):**  this investment can come back or can be completely recovered within 15 years after plantation.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:38:11):**  Paul, if I may.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:38:13):**  But I mean, this is an example now, like there can be, I mean, there can be ranges anywhere  
**[0:38:21-0:38:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:38:21):**  between 12 and 25 years.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:38:24):**  Paul, how much of those costs are linked to the high labor costs in Europe?  
**[0:38:28-0:38:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:38:28):**  I'm asking because typically in Africa, when we do regeneration or installing forestry  
**[0:38:34-0:38:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:38:34):**  systems, we are looking at costs between 20 and 200 dollars a hectare, which is almost  
**[0:38:39-0:38:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:38:39):**  two orders of magnitude less than what you were quoting.  
**[0:38:42-0:38:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:38:42):**  All I'm saying now is European, is a European context.  
**[0:38:48-0:38:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:38:48):**  If we speak about Africa or in other places, what's in South America, the systems we plant  
**[0:38:53-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:38:53):**  are by about two orders of magnitude cheaper.  
**[0:38:56-0:39:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:38:56):**  And that's labor costs that sits in all the items you have in a cost sheet.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:39:01):**  So basically, from what I just quoted, the 10,000 euros per hectare, that's probably  
**[0:39:07-0:39:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:39:07):**  half just the labor and some of the materials that you need.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:39:12):**  And then, well, let's say half about labor and the other half is material costs, etc.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:39:17):**  But in the material costs, for example, to plant, when you buy plants, then a lot of  
**[0:39:24-0:39:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:39:24):**  that money is actually money that goes to the, what you call it, the tree school.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:39:36):**  Personal basically.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:39:37):**  The nursery?  
**[0:39:38-0:39:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:39:38):**  The nursery, well, yeah, that's it.  
**[0:39:40-0:39:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:39:40):**  All right, well, that gives us a lot to think about the grand differences between regions.  
**[0:39:49-0:39:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:39:49):**  And I would imagine there's quite a bit of difference between areas of Europe as well,  
**[0:39:53-0:39:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:39:53):**  given that there are differences in labor costs as well.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:39:57):**  Now let's focus over into Linda's specialty in the sourcing and the business side of agroforestry.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:40:05):**  Now I know that there are a lot of companies and manufacturers that do incentivize best  
**[0:40:09-0:40:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:40:09):**  practices in agroforestry, both within the EU and abroad, as you've demonstrated, Linda,  
**[0:40:15-0:40:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:40:15):**  with your work in sourcing sustainable rubber for the condom company Einhorn.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:40:20):**  What have been the biggest challenges in finding and sourcing rubber from these polyculture  
**[0:40:25-0:40:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:40:25):**  rubber producers?  
**[0:40:26-0:40:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:40:26):**  Was it something that was easy to locate simply by asking around?  
**[0:40:31-0:40:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:40:31):**  Or did you really have to do some detective work to find sort of exemplary ecosystems  
**[0:40:37-0:40:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:40:37):**  that you were looking to support?  
**[0:40:40-0:40:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:40:40):**  Well, I think asking around brings you a long way already.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:40:46):**  And that's what I usually am spent, if there wasn't COVID, I would spend half of the year  
**[0:40:51-0:40:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:40:51):**  in Southeast Asia on these projects.  
**[0:40:56-0:41:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:40:56):**  So asking around and getting in contact with this agroforestry community and the rubber  
**[0:41:02-0:41:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:41:02):**  world, and then you will always find at one point or the other, you will find those pioneers  
**[0:41:09-0:41:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:41:09):**  or those people which are doing things differently.  
**[0:41:15-0:41:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:41:15):**  So it took a while, but finally we got there.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:41:19):**  But what was difficult or what was the biggest challenge is to, okay, it might be that you've  
**[0:41:26-0:41:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:41:26):**  identified them and that they are there, but to make this like an, like to organize it,  
**[0:41:36-0:41:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:41:36):**  to organize that they were very like individual farmers and we have like put them together  
**[0:41:41-0:41:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:41:41):**  as a group.  
**[0:41:42-0:41:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:41:42):**  I mean, they have put them together themselves, but we help them to like put up some infrastructure  
**[0:41:48-0:41:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:41:48):**  so that they would regularly meet, learn from each other, build like a learning center and  
**[0:41:53-0:41:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:41:53):**  also setting up the infrastructure to have a separate supply chain tracing back to those  
**[0:41:59-0:42:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:41:59):**  farmers was like for us from a business perspective difficult.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:42:04):**  And now it is interesting to see how they have through raising, through rising interest  
**[0:42:11-0:42:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:42:11):**  of businesses in that area, more and more farmers are looking at those pioneer farmers  
**[0:42:19-0:42:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:42:19):**  and saying, hey, what are you doing?  
**[0:42:20-0:42:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:42:20):**  Can we learn from you?  
**[0:42:21-0:42:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:42:21):**  So there's actually, it has actually started that all this adoption rate is increasing  
**[0:42:26-0:42:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:42:26):**  and the area is becoming slowly a little famous for agroforestry rubber.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:42:32):**  And in your opinion, what amount of power does the company who is sourcing the material  
**[0:42:37-0:42:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:42:37):**  have to direct the way that it is produced?  
**[0:42:40-0:42:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:42:40):**  Has it been a real incentive for others to sell their products for higher amounts or  
**[0:42:46-0:42:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:42:46):**  to learn from the education center that you've put together?  
**[0:42:50-0:42:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:42:50):**  Or are there other incentives that seem more powerful to the producers themselves?  
**[0:42:54-0:43:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:42:54):**  Well, I think demand side is one tool because when it comes, rubber is a very volatile price  
**[0:43:03-0:43:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:43:03):**  range and nearly 90% is grown by smallholders, which were like even more skeptical to price  
**[0:43:11-0:43:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:43:11):**  peaks.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:43:12):**  So everyone, many farmers are looking for like, how can we help ourselves to not be  
**[0:43:19-0:43:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:43:19):**  that reliant on that single crop from a financial perspective?  
**[0:43:26-0:43:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:43:26):**  But also obviously all this government and policy points are there in Thailand as well.  
**[0:43:31-0:43:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:43:31):**  Like when do you get subsidized and when not?  
**[0:43:34-0:43:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:43:34):**  And how does agroforestry, how can agroforestry work in this picture at all?  
**[0:43:41-0:43:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:43:41):**  But what I personally have experienced that when you look at the rubber industry, like  
**[0:43:46-0:43:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:43:46):**  14 million hectares are covered with rubber worldwide, mostly around in the tropics and  
**[0:43:52-0:43:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:43:52):**  mostly only in monocultures and in partly in very huge plantations, which are delivering  
**[0:43:58-0:44:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:43:58):**  to one tire manufacturer only.  
**[0:44:01-0:44:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:44:01):**  And the adoption of change there and the possibility to look into more sustainable practices is  
**[0:44:10-0:44:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:44:10):**  very limited.  
**[0:44:11-0:44:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:44:11):**  And when I started going to rubber conferences, people were always having, yeah, but that's  
**[0:44:16-0:44:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:44:16):**  not economically beneficial and it can't work out and it's too high cost to get it running.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:44:24):**  And now we have proven them, hey, it is running.  
**[0:44:27-0:44:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:44:27):**  And the yields are at least as high as it was in monoculture and the farmers are happy  
**[0:44:33-0:44:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:44:33):**  doing it.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:44:34):**  Yes, there is more labor involved, but it's also like it is working right now.  
**[0:44:40-0:44:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:44:40):**  So to give those examples from a business perspective as well and showing it is possible  
**[0:44:45-0:44:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:44:45):**  and it's feasible to do so, I think definitely can at least change the stubborn topic of  
**[0:44:53-0:45:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:44:53):**  the limitations of sustainability and that it ends with maybe not using glyphosate or  
**[0:45:00-0:45:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:45:00):**  something, but that there is so much more to it and that the conversations about sustainability  
**[0:45:06-0:45:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:45:06):**  from a business perspective has to change towards more regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:45:11):**  And this has to start somewhere.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:45:12):**  And with showing that it can work, I think it's a good start to work into this direction.  
**[0:45:22-0:45:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:45:22):**  If I may, Linda, you're clearly an exceptional businesswoman because you can make a jungle  
**[0:45:29-0:45:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:45:29):**  rubber system work.  
**[0:45:31-0:45:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:45:31):**  I have a slide here on my screen.  
**[0:45:33-0:45:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:45:33):**  I don't know if we can authorize screen sharing.  
**[0:45:36-0:45:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:45:36):**  We did work in the early 2010s comparing jungle rubber, as we call it, these complex agroforestry  
**[0:45:42-0:45:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:45:42):**  rubber systems with plantation systems and it's obvious, I think you can see that now.  
**[0:45:54-0:45:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:45:54):**  It's obvious that the plantation systems are bad compared to the polycropping system.  
**[0:45:59-0:46:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:45:59):**  The polycropping systems have more products, they have more biodiversity, they need less  
**[0:46:03-0:46:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:46:03):**  phytosanitation, they have lower social costs because they're owner farmers as opposed to  
**[0:46:08-0:46:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:46:08):**  workers.  
**[0:46:09-0:46:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:46:09):**  They have very low environmental costs, whereas the plantations have none of that.  
**[0:46:14-0:46:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:46:14):**  The plantations make less money, they have less biodiversity, they need more inputs and  
**[0:46:19-0:46:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:46:19):**  they have higher social impacts.  
**[0:46:20-0:46:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:46:20):**  So why do the plantations keep on spreading?  
**[0:46:24-0:46:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:46:24):**  And the reason is very simple.  
**[0:46:26-0:46:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:46:26):**  It's because if you're a buyer of rubber, it's a lot easier to deal with one guy who  
**[0:46:29-0:46:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:46:29):**  has a 5,000 hectare plantation of rubber than to deal with 2,500 farmers who each have two  
**[0:46:35-0:46:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:46:35):**  hectares and are not only producing rubber, but a lot of other things in between.  
**[0:46:41-0:46:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:46:41):**  And so the question that I have to you is how did you get over that cost differential?  
**[0:46:46-0:46:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:46:46):**  Because you had to invest more to deal with the smallholders than your competitors have  
**[0:46:52-0:46:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:46:52):**  when they're dealing with a plantation.  
**[0:46:54-0:46:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:46:54):**  That's true.  
**[0:46:55-0:47:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:46:55):**  But looking at it, it is easier to deal with one plantation versus several plots of land.  
**[0:47:03-0:47:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:47:03):**  But in reality, 90% of rubber is grown in small hole with smallholders.  
**[0:47:09-0:47:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:47:09):**  Only 10% is covered with those huge plantations, like 10% of the rubber output.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:47:15):**  So all those 70% of rubber ends up in tire industry.  
**[0:47:19-0:47:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:47:19):**  So all of those big tire companies have smallholders in their value chain.  
**[0:47:26-0:47:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:47:26):**  Not all of them can only supply from big plantations.  
**[0:47:29-0:47:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:47:29):**  So all of them have to invest in smallholders as well and in those small pieces of land.  
**[0:47:40-0:47:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:47:40):**  But it definitely needs more work and more money to do so and to get those transparency,  
**[0:47:46-0:47:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:47:46):**  first of all, because it's, as you said, much more easier to get transparency to one big  
**[0:47:51-0:47:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:47:51):**  plot.  
**[0:47:54-0:48:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:47:54):**  But maybe that's an exception as a company as well, because we are a social business  
**[0:48:00-0:48:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:48:00):**  and we are investing 50% of our profits into setting up fair sustainability, how we call  
**[0:48:06-0:48:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:48:06):**  it.  
**[0:48:07-0:48:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:48:07):**  But yes, we did have a lot of input costs to set it up.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:48:11):**  But looking at it now, keeping it running and getting the huge demand from other companies  
**[0:48:19-0:48:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:48:19):**  and also other shoe companies, not the big tire companies, but shoe companies and glove  
**[0:48:25-0:48:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:48:25):**  companies and many others addressing us and saying, hey, cool, you've managed.  
**[0:48:29-0:48:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:48:29):**  Can we learn from you and can we do it?  
**[0:48:33-0:48:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:48:33):**  So I think it needed someone to be persistent.  
**[0:48:38-0:48:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:48:38):**  It took us three years to finally supply the rubber from them.  
**[0:48:42-0:48:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:48:42):**  And while we were supplying, we were sourcing from other sources.  
**[0:48:46-0:48:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:48:46):**  So it was like a full project over a couple of years.  
**[0:48:53-0:48:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:48:53):**  And yes, it was expensive.  
**[0:48:55-0:48:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:48:55):**  But for I mean, we are 25 people at Einhorn.  
**[0:48:58-0:48:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:48:58):**  We were crowdfunded.  
**[0:48:59-0:49:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:48:59):**  We have no external investors in.  
**[0:49:01-0:49:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:49:01):**  So there isn't any shareholder telling us what we should do, but we can tell ourselves  
**[0:49:07-0:49:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:49:07):**  what we do with our money, what we are doing.  
**[0:49:09-0:49:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:49:09):**  So we don't need to have profit maximization and full stop.  
**[0:49:14-0:49:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:49:14):**  But yes, we have profit maximization to use those profits to work towards the more sustainable  
**[0:49:20-0:49:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:49:20):**  future.  
**[0:49:21-0:49:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:49:21):**  And that's the benefits of the company working for thankfully so that we can do this.  
**[0:49:27-0:49:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:49:27):**  Yeah.  
**[0:49:29-0:49:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:49:29):**  So are you are you do you call yourself an agroforestry condom company or are you an  
**[0:49:37-0:49:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:49:37):**  agroforestry rubber company?  
**[0:49:40-0:49:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:49:40):**  Well, we don't call ourselves agroforestry at all because it's the farmers practicing  
**[0:49:44-0:49:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:49:44):**  agroforestry and we are just sourcing their rubber.  
**[0:49:49-0:49:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:49:49):**  But you are certifying in a way, right?  
**[0:49:50-0:49:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:49:50):**  Your customers know when they buy your products that they are getting an agroforestry product.  
**[0:49:55-0:49:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:49:55):**  Well, we are about to get there.  
**[0:49:57-0:50:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:49:57):**  So far, we were only very open in communicating what we are working on and that the aim is  
**[0:50:03-0:50:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:50:03):**  to integrate to have a condom 100% made of latex grown in agroforestry systems.  
**[0:50:11-0:50:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:50:11):**  And now, like this year, we are starting this communication about it.  
**[0:50:14-0:50:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:50:14):**  But we've been doing this for the last years without without selling it.  
**[0:50:18-0:50:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:50:18):**  We're just doing it.  
**[0:50:20-0:50:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:50:20):**  And now it's now we are seeing that we can talk about and we're not yet sure how we name  
**[0:50:26-0:50:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:50:26):**  it because we're talking with the farmers how they would like to call it as well.  
**[0:50:29-0:50:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:50:29):**  It's like a joint project.  
**[0:50:32-0:50:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:50:32):**  But it will be something like agroforestry rubber initiative.  
**[0:50:37-0:50:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:50:37):**  What extent did you have to cut out the middleman at some point?  
**[0:50:40-0:50:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:50:40):**  That's something I'm always wondering when we think about this strategy of including  
**[0:50:46-0:50:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:50:46):**  more the demand side into agroforestry project.  
**[0:50:52-0:50:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:50:52):**  So for us, it was so as condoms as a medical product, it's very it needs really high quality  
**[0:50:59-0:51:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:50:59):**  latex and it cannot so and latex when it's tapped from the tree, it's roughly 30% rubber  
**[0:51:06-0:51:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:51:06):**  content, 70% water.  
**[0:51:10-0:51:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:51:10):**  And when it comes from the teeth like raw milk, and if you don't process it quickly,  
**[0:51:14-0:51:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:51:14):**  it turns sour and then you can't use it for dipping products anymore.  
**[0:51:17-0:51:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:51:17):**  And condoms are like dipped in liquid latex.  
**[0:51:21-0:51:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:51:21):**  So we needed to make this supply chain from the from the field, from the farm to the processor,  
**[0:51:29-0:51:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:51:29):**  because after the latex is centrifuged and after processing, it can stay for two months  
**[0:51:35-0:51:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:51:35):**  or something.  
**[0:51:36-0:51:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:51:36):**  But this the distance between farm and processor is crucial in quality aspects of liquid latex.  
**[0:51:43-0:51:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:51:43):**  So we couldn't afford to have too many steps in between for the sake of the quality of  
**[0:51:50-0:51:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:51:50):**  the of the milk of the latex milk.  
**[0:51:53-0:52:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:51:53):**  So yes, we could have identified also two or three middlemen who would like do the job,  
**[0:52:01-0:52:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:52:01):**  but we could we could convince the processor to work directly with the farmers, because  
**[0:52:06-0:52:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:52:06):**  she is aware of the quality she needs.  
**[0:52:09-0:52:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:52:09):**  And she's aware of the parameters, how she gets those quality and how the bacteria content  
**[0:52:15-0:52:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:52:15):**  of the latex can be cut down and like different different parameters.  
**[0:52:19-0:52:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:52:19):**  And she could like teach the farmers directly to do that.  
**[0:52:25-0:52:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:52:25):**  The reason I'm asking is that I experienced that the fact or the simple phenomenon as  
**[0:52:32-0:52:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:52:32):**  that the demand side, let's say the the final customer of the product doesn't really get  
**[0:52:40-0:52:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:52:40):**  involved that much in the way of producing the raw material.  
**[0:52:45-0:52:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:52:45):**  That's a completely new exercise to many producers.  
**[0:52:48-0:52:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:52:48):**  So they are not used to that sort of intervention.  
**[0:52:53-0:52:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:52:53):**  And and it helps.  
**[0:52:55-0:53:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:52:55):**  It can help tremendously to get things going.  
**[0:53:00-0:53:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:53:00):**  But it's a new type of dialogue.  
**[0:53:02-0:53:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:53:02):**  And to organize that dialogue, I mean, for example, the IT food, they also running a  
**[0:53:06-0:53:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:53:06):**  new program now in regenerative agriculture and trying to to instruct farmers, mostly  
**[0:53:14-0:53:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:53:14):**  in southern Europe and their long term game is similar, they want to involve large consumer  
**[0:53:21-0:53:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:53:21):**  good companies to basically give preferred offtake agreements to farmers that do regenerative  
**[0:53:27-0:53:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:53:27):**  agriculture coming out of those programs.  
**[0:53:30-0:53:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:53:30):**  And this dialogue is not easy.  
**[0:53:36-0:53:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:53:36):**  And I think, I mean, for us, it was crucial to have this to have this process in between.  
**[0:53:42-0:53:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:53:42):**  And this was basically a work of three months.  
**[0:53:45-0:53:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:53:45):**  I was just driving around finding like pitching the idea to different different processes  
**[0:53:49-0:53:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:53:49):**  saying, hey, let's do agroforestry together, you can invest in it.  
**[0:53:53-0:53:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:53:53):**  And it would be really cool.  
**[0:53:54-0:53:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:53:54):**  And you'll get more money from us if you just supply from them and help help them setting  
**[0:53:59-0:54:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:53:59):**  it up.  
**[0:54:00-0:54:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:54:00):**  And because because everyone is like in this in this world, everyone was just looking,  
**[0:54:05-0:54:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:54:05):**  okay, how much money will I get to do this?  
**[0:54:07-0:54:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:54:07):**  And so I needed to find someone and this is what I found in Sudita, our processor, who  
**[0:54:13-0:54:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:54:13):**  would understand why we do this, why is agroforestry something beneficial for our planet, for the  
**[0:54:20-0:54:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:54:20):**  future of our children, of everyone.  
**[0:54:23-0:54:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:54:23):**  And so I convinced her from a mindset point of view, to work with us on this.  
**[0:54:29-0:54:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:54:29):**  And money was also an aspect, but money could have been an aspect for all the others, but  
**[0:54:35-0:54:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:54:35):**  none of them was willing to invest time to set it up.  
**[0:54:39-0:54:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:54:39):**  And she was because she shared, she understood the vision of why it is important from other  
**[0:54:45-0:54:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:54:45):**  companies and also other shoes, like not the big tire companies, but shoe companies and  
**[0:54:51-0:54:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:54:51):**  glove companies and many others addressing us and saying, hey, cool, you've, you've managed  
**[0:54:55-0:54:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:54:55):**  like, can we learn from you?  
**[0:54:57-0:54:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:54:57):**  And can we do it?  
**[0:54:58-0:55:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:54:58):**  Or can we like, so I think it needed someone to be persistent.  
**[0:55:04-0:55:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:55:04):**  And I mean, it took us three years to finally supply the rubber from them.  
**[0:55:09-0:55:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:55:09):**  And while we were supplying, we were sourcing from other sources, right?  
**[0:55:12-0:55:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:55:12):**  So it was like a full project over a couple of years.  
**[0:55:17-0:55:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:55:17):**  But, and yes, it was expensive.  
**[0:55:21-0:55:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:55:21):**  But for, I mean, we are 25 people at Einhorn, we were crowdfunded, we have no external investors  
**[0:55:27-0:55:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:55:27):**  in, so there isn't any shareholder telling us what we should do, but we can tell ourselves  
**[0:55:33-0:55:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:55:33):**  what we do with our money, what we are doing.  
**[0:55:35-0:55:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:55:35):**  So we don't need to have profit maximization and full stop.  
**[0:55:40-0:55:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:55:40):**  But yes, we have profit maximization to use those profits to work towards the more sustainable  
**[0:55:47-0:55:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:55:47):**  future.  
**[0:55:48-0:55:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:55:48):**  And that's the benefits of the company I'm working for, thankfully, so that we can do  
**[0:55:52-0:55:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:55:52):**  this.  
**[0:55:53-0:55:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:55:53):**  And yeah.  
**[0:55:54-0:56:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:55:54):**  So are you, are you, do you call yourself an agroforestry condom company?  
**[0:56:01-0:56:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:56:01):**  Or are you an agroforestry rubber company?  
**[0:56:04-0:56:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:56:04):**  Well, we are, we don't call ourselves agroforestry at all, because it's the farmers practicing  
**[0:56:09-0:56:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:56:09):**  agroforestry and we are just sourcing their rubber.  
**[0:56:13-0:56:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:56:13):**  But you are certifying in a way, right?  
**[0:56:14-0:56:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:56:14):**  Your customers know when they buy your products that they are getting an agroforestry product.  
**[0:56:19-0:56:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:56:19):**  Well, right, we are, we are about to get there.  
**[0:56:21-0:56:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:56:21):**  So far, we have only, we were only very open in communicating what we're working on, and  
**[0:56:27-0:56:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:56:27):**  that the aim is to integrate, to have a condom 100% made of latex grown in agroforestry systems.  
**[0:56:35-0:56:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:56:35):**  And now, like this year, we are starting this communication about it.  
**[0:56:38-0:56:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:56:38):**  But we've been doing this for the last years without, without selling it.  
**[0:56:42-0:56:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:56:42):**  We're just doing it.  
**[0:56:44-0:56:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:56:44):**  And now it's now we are seeing that we can talk about, and we're not yet sure how we  
**[0:56:50-0:56:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:56:50):**  name it, because we're talking with the farmers how they would like to call it as well.  
**[0:56:54-0:56:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:56:54):**  It's a like a joint project.  
**[0:56:56-0:57:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:56:56):**  But it will be something like agroforestry rubber initiative.  
**[0:57:01-0:57:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:57:01):**  What extent did you have to cut out the middleman at some point?  
**[0:57:05-0:57:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:57:05):**  That's something I'm always wondering when, when we think about this strategy of including  
**[0:57:10-0:57:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:57:10):**  more the demand side into agroforestry project.  
**[0:57:16-0:57:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:57:16):**  So for us, it was so as, as condoms as a medical product, it's very, it needs really high quality  
**[0:57:24-0:57:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:57:24):**  latex and it cannot, so rub and latex when it's tapped from the tree, it's roughly 30%  
**[0:57:31-0:57:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:57:31):**  rubber content, 70% water.  
**[0:57:34-0:57:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:57:34):**  And when it comes from the tea, it's like raw milk.  
**[0:57:36-0:57:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:57:36):**  And if you don't process it quickly, it turns sour.  
**[0:57:39-0:57:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:57:39):**  And then you can't use it for dipping products anymore.  
**[0:57:42-0:57:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:57:42):**  And condoms are like, are dipped in liquid latex.  
**[0:57:46-0:57:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:57:46):**  So we needed to make this supply chain from the, from the field, from the farm to the  
**[0:57:52-0:57:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:57:52):**  processor, because after the latex is centrifuged and after processing, it can stay for two  
**[0:57:59-0:58:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:57:59):**  months or something.  
**[0:58:00-0:58:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:58:00):**  But this, the distance between farm and processor is crucial in quality aspects of liquid latex.  
**[0:58:08-0:58:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:58:08):**  So we couldn't afford to have too many steps in between for the sake of the quality of  
**[0:58:14-0:58:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:58:14):**  the, of the milk, of the latex milk.  
**[0:58:17-0:58:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:58:17):**  So yes, we could have identified also two or three middlemen who would like do the job,  
**[0:58:26-0:58:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:58:26):**  but we could, we could convince the processor to work directly with the farmers because  
**[0:58:30-0:58:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:58:30):**  she is aware of the quality she needs.  
**[0:58:34-0:58:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:58:34):**  And she's aware of the parameters, how she gets those quality and how the bacterial content  
**[0:58:39-0:58:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:58:39):**  of the latex can be cut down and like different, different parameters.  
**[0:58:44-0:58:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:58:44):**  And she could like teach the farmers directly to do that.  
**[0:58:51-0:58:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:58:51):**  The reason why I'm asking is that I experienced that the fact or the simple phenomenon as  
**[0:58:56-0:59:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:58:56):**  a, that the demand side, let's say the, the final customer of the product doesn't really  
**[0:59:05-0:59:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:59:05):**  or gets involved that much in the way of producing the raw material.  
**[0:59:10-0:59:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:59:10):**  That's a completely new exercise to many producers.  
**[0:59:14-0:59:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:59:14):**  So they are, they're not used to that sort of intervention and, and it helps, it can  
**[0:59:21-0:59:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:59:21):**  help tremendously to get things going.  
**[0:59:25-0:59:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:59:25):**  But it's a new type of dialogue and to organize that dialogue.  
**[0:59:29-0:59:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:59:29):**  I mean, for example, EIT foods, they're also running a new program now in regenerative  
**[0:59:34-0:59:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:59:34):**  agriculture and trying to, to instruct farmers mostly in Southern Europe and their long-term  
**[0:59:42-0:59:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:59:42):**  games is similar.  
**[0:59:43-0:59:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:59:43):**  They want to involve large consumer good companies to basically give preferred off-take agreements  
**[0:59:51-0:59:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:59:51):**  to farmers that do regenerative agriculture coming out of those programs.  
**[0:59:56-1:00:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=0:59:56):**  And this dialogue is, is, yeah, it's not easy.  
**[1:00:01-1:00:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=1:00:01):**  Yeah, and I think, I mean, for us, it was crucial to have this, to have this process  
**[1:00:06-1:00:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=1:00:06):**  in between.  
**[1:00:07-1:00:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=1:00:07):**  And this was basically a work of three months.  
**[1:00:10-1:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=1:00:10):**  I was just driving around finding, like pitching the idea to different, different processes  
**[1:00:14-1:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=1:00:14):**  saying, Hey, let's do agroforestry together.  
**[1:00:18-1:00:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=1:00:18):**  You can invest in it and it would be really cool.

**[1:00:41-1:00:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=1:00:41):**  Why is agroforestry something beneficial for our planet, for the future of our children,  
**[1:00:48-1:00:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=1:00:48):**  of everyone.  
**[1:00:49-1:00:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=1:00:49):**  And so I convinced her from a mindset point of view to work with us on this.  
**[1:00:55-1:01:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=1:00:55):**  And money was also an aspect, but money could have been an aspect for all the others, but  
**[1:01:01-1:01:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=1:01:01):**  none of them was willing to invest time to set it up.  
**[1:01:05-1:01:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=1:01:05):**  And she was, because she shared, she understood the vision of why it is important.  
**[1:01:13-1:01:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=1:01:13):**  Thanks once again to the three panelists, Patrick, Paul and Linda, who are all working  
**[1:01:17-1:01:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=1:01:17):**  tirelessly to create a healthier, more equitable supply system and land management practices  
**[1:01:22-1:01:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=1:01:22):**  in Europe and around the world.  
**[1:01:24-1:01:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=1:01:24):**  And a special thanks to the team at Climate Farmers for organizing the event and to all  
**[1:01:27-1:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=1:01:27):**  the wonderful people who showed up and participated in the chat.  
**[1:01:31-1:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=1:01:31):**  Now, as great as it is to include multiple experience perspectives on the topics that  
**[1:01:35-1:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=1:01:35):**  we covered in this panel, it's impossible to include the full range of opinions and  
**[1:01:39-1:01:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=1:01:39):**  viewpoints out there.  
**[1:01:41-1:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=1:01:41):**  And that's why I'm inviting you to join the growing community building regenerative  
**[1:01:44-1:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=1:01:44):**  skills to use in their daily lives.  
**[1:01:47-1:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=1:01:47):**  It will always be free to join, and all you have to do is follow the links on the homepage  
**[1:01:52-1:01:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=1:01:52):**  of the regenerative skills website.  
**[1:01:54-1:01:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=1:01:54):**  The benefit of joining through our Discord channel is that unlike social media platforms  
**[1:01:58-1:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=1:01:58):**  that mine your personal data and manipulate your feeds based on algorithms just to sell  
**[1:02:03-1:02:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=1:02:03):**  you more junk, I founded these channels purely for knowledge, skill, and story exchange between  
**[1:02:08-1:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=1:02:08):**  the people who care to make their worlds better for everyone.  
**[1:02:12-1:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=1:02:12):**  This week's question, which we'll be discussing on the forum, is, what products that you use  
**[1:02:16-1:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=1:02:16):**  regularly already come from tree and perennial plant products?  
**[1:02:21-1:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=1:02:21):**  There are so many ways to positively affect the production and consumption systems that  
**[1:02:24-1:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=1:02:24):**  we participate in, and I can't wait to hear about your ideas.  
**[1:02:28-1:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=1:02:28):**  So don't forget, you can also help to guide the panel discussions that I've got planned  
**[1:02:32-1:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=1:02:32):**  for the future by suggesting topics and guests on the forums as well.  
**[1:02:38-1:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=1:02:38):**  That's our show for this week.  
**[1:02:39-1:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=1:02:39):**  Until next time, keep taking those little steps every day towards a regenerative future,  
**[1:02:44-1:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=1:02:44):**  and I'll be right by your side along the way.  
**[1:02:46-1:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=1:02:46):**  Thank you so much for joining.  
**[1:02:47-1:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=1:02:47):**  It's a tough one.  
**[1:02:48-1:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=1:02:48):**  Thank you.

**[1:02:53-1:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-potential-of-agroforestry-expert-panel-2/#t=1:02:53):**  I'm still on coffee.

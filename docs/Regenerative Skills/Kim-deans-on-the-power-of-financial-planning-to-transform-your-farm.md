**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:00:53):**  I'm really excited to present today's interview, and it's probably going to sound  
**[0:00:58-0:01:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:00:58):**  really nerdy to have had so much fun talking about farm finances and profitability, but  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:01:03):**  trust me, by the end of this session you'll completely understand.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:01:07):**  Now let me start by saying that I am a complete novice to the world of finance, accounting,  
**[0:01:12-0:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:01:12):**  and really just simple math.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:01:14):**  I mean, I get by just fine.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:01:15):**  I even think that I organize my personal finances better than most people, but that's because  
**[0:01:20-0:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:01:20):**  I'm organized, not because I have any training in financial planning or bookkeeping.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:01:25):**  But despite my lack of formal knowledge, I've long admired people who are able to compute  
**[0:01:30-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:01:30):**  the large amounts of numbers and financial data that come in and out of a business and  
**[0:01:35-0:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:01:35):**  then use them to make sense of its operations.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:01:38):**  The truth is that being able to decipher balance sheets and cash flows and profit and loss  
**[0:01:43-0:01:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:01:43):**  statements and other windows into the fiscal health of a business really unlocks the power  
**[0:01:49-0:01:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:01:49):**  to diagnose problems while they're still easy and manageable, and to predict the trajectory  
**[0:01:54-0:01:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:01:54):**  and risks that you're going to encounter throughout your year and beyond.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:01:59):**  Now I know that there are tons of businesses and accounting professionals who specialize  
**[0:02:03-0:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:02:03):**  in just about every job sector and industry out there, but I personally have rarely come  
**[0:02:07-0:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:02:07):**  across people who specialize in farms and who understand the wild variables and the

**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:02:15):**  Luckily though, just after our last interview, Nicole Masters from Integrity Soil suggested  
**[0:02:20-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:02:20):**  that I reach out to a friend and colleague of hers in Australia who she promised could  
**[0:02:24-0:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:02:24):**  shed some light on the lingering questions that I had.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:02:28):**  And that brings me to Kim Deans.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:02:30):**  Kim has 30 years of experience and has worked closely with hundreds of farming businesses  
**[0:02:35-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:02:35):**  through processes of change.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:02:38):**  Alongside her work with other farmers, Kim has been implementing methods now known as  
**[0:02:42-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:02:42):**  regenerative agriculture on her property in New South Wales over the past 17 years.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:02:49):**  Kim specializes in working with innovative farmers who are disillusioned with the high-input

**[0:03:05-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:03:05):**  profit and resilience into their business with the aim of making farming enjoyable again.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:03:11):**  Over her career, Kim has created well-tested processes designed to empower farmers to break  
**[0:03:16-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:03:16):**  out of information overwhelm and confidently take the next steps to implementing regenerative  
**[0:03:21-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:03:21):**  agriculture practices that are appropriate to both their scale and their context.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:03:27):**  At the core of this process is financial diagnostics to illuminate issues in management at various  
**[0:03:32-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:03:32):**  levels of their enterprise.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:03:34):**  And in this interview, Kim tells me how her early work as a financial advisor to farmers  
**[0:03:39-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:03:39):**  shone a light on the issues of soil degradation and made it clear exactly how important caring  
**[0:03:45-0:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:03:45):**  for the health of a farm ecosystem really is for the health of farm businesses.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:03:50):**  We talk about specific strategies and techniques that she's found most helpful in guiding  
**[0:03:55-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:03:55):**  people through the financial planning process, especially if they're new to it.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:03:59):**  We also talk about the essential skills that someone needs to practice to begin thinking  
**[0:04:04-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:04:04):**  analytically about how to improve the profitability of their farm business, de-risk their enterprises,  
**[0:04:10-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:04:10):**  and even assess the profitability of a new farm enterprise.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:04:15):**  Even if finances and accounting don't seem like the most interesting topics to you, I  
**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:04:19):**  encourage you to dive into this one because Kim has a way of communicating complex aspects  
**[0:04:24-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:04:24):**  into simple processes and connecting it all with the bigger picture of holistic farm well-being.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:04:30):**  I also want to remind you before we get started that you can now connect to the vast network

**[0:04:40-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:04:40):**  We know that making the transition to profitable regenerative agriculture is hard enough, but  
**[0:04:45-0:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:04:45):**  without support from people with experience and who understand your unique context, you  
**[0:04:50-0:04:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:04:50):**  can waste needless time, money, and effort along the way.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:04:54):**  So don't do it alone!

**[0:04:59-0:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:04:59):**  Skills website, and we'll help you to find tailored assistance that can fast track your  
**[0:05:03-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:05:03):**  transformation and get you where you dream of going.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:05:07):**  But with that said, I'll hand things over now to Kim Deans.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:05:13):**  Could you tell me how you got into working with financial assistance and planning in  
**[0:05:18-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:05:18):**  rural communities in Australia?  
**[0:05:20-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:05:20):**  Yeah, well it's interesting because I was in a farming business for a number of years  
**[0:05:28-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:05:28):**  in my first marriage, and I had a natural aptitude for the financial aspect of farming  
**[0:05:33-0:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:05:33):**  businesses, although I am a very holistic thinker.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:05:36):**  And then something I always wanted to work on was to work with the Rural Financial Counselling  
**[0:05:42-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:05:42):**  Service, and that farming business was great training for that role, as life seems to be.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:05:47):**  You'd be careful what you wish for.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:05:50):**  And so I spent 12 years working, in addition to running my own business, I spent 12 years  
**[0:05:55-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:05:55):**  working as a Rural Financial Counsellor in my local community.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:05:58):**  And that is a service that's unique to Australia, as I told you before.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:06:04):**  It was started in a rural community in Australia where the banks were foreclosing on farmers,  
**[0:06:09-0:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:06:09):**  and they really didn't have the support to help them negotiate on equal footing.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:06:13):**  So a farmer started doing this as a voluntary service, and it then became a government funded  
**[0:06:18-0:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:06:18):**  program which has been running for a couple of decades now, I guess, throughout Australia,  
**[0:06:24-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:06:24):**  helping farmers to become, like learn more financial literacy, improve their budgeting  
**[0:06:28-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:06:28):**  skills, better negotiate with banks, but also just improve their business management and  
**[0:06:34-0:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:06:34):**  help them make informed decisions.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:06:36):**  So a lot of my processes were learned there.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:06:39):**  And I'd had a major soil health aha moment in that farming business that I started in.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:06:45):**  And the more I worked with financials, the more passionate I got about soil and regenerative  
**[0:06:50-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:06:50):**  agriculture, even before it was called Regen.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:06:52):**  It was like obvious to me that I could see the state of our natural capital reflected  
**[0:06:57-0:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:06:57):**  in the financials of the businesses.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:06:59):**  So it only encouraged me more and more down a regenerative path working with financials.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:07:05):**  But yeah, I've always been a pretty holistic thinker.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:07:09):**  That's really interesting.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:07:10):**  And I've heard that from a few other people.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:07:12):**  But let's unpack a little bit about how you made that connection between the financial  
**[0:07:16-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:07:16):**  aspect and the soil health.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:07:18):**  What were some of those aha moments and what were the observations that led to them?  
**[0:07:23-0:07:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:07:23):**  I had a big aha moment when it was probably about 25 years ago.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:07:28):**  And as I said, I was I was I married into a farming business.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:07:32):**  And my ex husband and I were checking on wheat crops as they'd probably about May, June,  
**[0:07:39-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:07:39):**  the crop had been sown, it was just emerging.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:07:41):**  And there was an air of the paddock that looked really sick.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:07:45):**  And so I'm just going on what happened here?  
**[0:07:47-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:07:47):**  The fertiliser regrown out.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:07:49):**  So I've just suddenly seen, well, these are where we were farming, the soils were amazing.  
**[0:07:55-0:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:07:55):**  And they were renowned for being very fertile soils.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:07:59):**  That's what happens without fertiliser.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:08:01):**  We're in big trouble, like early stages of farm succession planning and all the rest  
**[0:08:05-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:08:05):**  of it.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:08:06):**  To see what happened without fertiliser, I immediately saw a soil health problem where  
**[0:08:11-0:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:08:11):**  other people may have seen, oh, we needed fertiliser.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:08:14):**  So I started this is 25 years ago.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:08:16):**  The internet was just beginning.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:08:18):**  And so I started I couldn't get information readily.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:08:22):**  I started looking at soil and researching how could I get feedlot manure?  
**[0:08:26-0:08:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:08:26):**  How could I study reading about worm farms and things like that.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:08:29):**  But at that time, I just didn't wasn't able to tap into the information that's there now.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:08:34):**  But when that information appeared, I was ready for it.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:08:37):**  Like I soon got access to all of that and the whole world opened up.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:08:40):**  But yeah, that's sort of what drove me to start to see I could see the connection then  
**[0:08:45-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:08:45):**  between soil health and viability and farm succession planning and how we need to have  
**[0:08:52-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:08:52):**  a healthy resource base to have a viable business because we were doing a lot of budgets and  
**[0:08:57-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:08:57):**  looking at how do we make this work.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:09:00):**  And when you I could already see that if we're that reliant on inputs, we're not resilient.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:09:06):**  So it's sort of that's what sparked me.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:09:08):**  And it was all connected.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:09:09):**  Like I've never been one that can really specialise.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:09:12):**  I've always been very generalist in my approach in agriculture and life.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:09:16):**  So it kind of just naturally opened that door to the financial link and the soil health  
**[0:09:21-0:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:09:21):**  link.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:09:22):**  And I just couldn't unsee it.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:09:23):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:09:24):**  Wow.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:09:25):**  That makes a lot of sense.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:09:26):**  And it's really interesting to hear someone say that from the financial perspective.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:09:29):**  Right.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:09:30):**  We've often talked about how it reflects in crops and the way that they're trying to reduce  
**[0:09:35-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:09:35):**  inputs or just improve percolation of water and all these other effects that are much  
**[0:09:40-0:09:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:09:40):**  more ecosystem focused.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:09:42):**  But it comes down to the bottom line of the profitability of the business really clearly  
**[0:09:46-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:09:46):**  there.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:09:47):**  Yeah, it really did.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:09:48):**  And that was quite a some time ago.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:09:50):**  And that situation's only become more more exacerbated.  
**[0:09:54-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:09:54):**  You know.  
**[0:09:55-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:09:55):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:56-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:09:56):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:09:57):**  How have you started to see that with the other farmers and rural land workers that  
**[0:10:02-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:10:02):**  you have helped to kind of financially plan and collaborate with in that aspect of your  
**[0:10:10-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:10:10):**  work?  
**[0:10:11-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:10:11):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:10:12):**  So I was walking in my door as I was in that role, I worked with hundreds of farming businesses  
**[0:10:17-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:10:17):**  throughout this area.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:10:19):**  And some of them were leaving the industry.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:10:22):**  Some of them were really viable.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:10:23):**  You know, that was a range of businesses.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:10:25):**  So I got to learn a lot.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:10:27):**  And, you know, I'd get phone calls through droughts with farmers saying, well, we've  
**[0:10:30-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:10:30):**  had three inches of rain and it's still too dry to sow a wheat crop.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:10:34):**  All I hear is soil health.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:10:36):**  You know, like, OK, well, that soil is not absorbing water.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:10:40):**  You know, how I could see how those people were creating their own droughts.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:10:44):**  Some of those people were open to those conversations and others weren't.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:10:47):**  But, you know, it's just kept coming.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:10:49):**  And I kept seeing people becoming more and more vulnerable to climate variability.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:10:54):**  There was no resilience.  
**[0:10:55-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:10:55):**  You know, the input costs just kept rising.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:10:59):**  And I'd left farming probably three years before I started working in that role.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:11:05):**  And I started doing budgets based on what I'd known in farming.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:11:10):**  And we were cropping farmers.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:11:11):**  I could budget easily.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:11:13):**  And the farmers started looking like I was a bit crazy.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:11:15):**  And in those few years, the cost of production had risen so much that you needed an above  
**[0:11:20-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:11:20):**  average yield to break even.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:11:22):**  And my old budgets weren't cutting it anymore.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:11:25):**  So that was also a wake up call that this is not sustainable.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:11:28):**  This is not profitable.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:11:29):**  Yet, you know, people are still doing it.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:11:32):**  You know, why is that?  
**[0:11:33-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:11:33):**  So those were some of the things that I saw.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:11:35):**  But what I really learned, probably my biggest take home, being able to sort of get under  
**[0:11:40-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:11:40):**  the hood of businesses, which is a really privileged position.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:11:44):**  You know, it's not easy to access that information.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:11:46):**  But I had the privilege of seeing what was going on.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:11:50):**  I could see that most viable businesses were managing in three key areas really well.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:11:54):**  They were managing their financial resources, they were managing their human resources,  
**[0:11:59-0:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:11:59):**  and they were managing their natural resources as well.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:12:02):**  The ones that were most, the most challenged financially were not managing in either one  
**[0:12:07-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:12:07):**  or all of those three key areas, but it only took one to bring the house of cards tumbling  
**[0:12:12-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:12:12):**  down.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:12:13):**  So they could be managing financially, but really degrading their landscape, they were  
**[0:12:17-0:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:12:17):**  vulnerable.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:12:18):**  If they were managing well in other areas, but the people side was struggling, things  
**[0:12:22-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:12:22):**  could come tumbling down.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:12:23):**  And also they could be really awesome farmers and producers.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:12:28):**  But if they didn't know, have any financial skills that they couldn't do what they could  
**[0:12:32-0:12:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:12:32):**  do best successfully.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:12:34):**  So they all go together.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:12:36):**  And so those were the things that I was able to really learn and see.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:12:39):**  And like I said, made me more passionate about regeneration in rural communities on every  
**[0:12:44-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:12:44):**  level.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:12:45):**  Yeah.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:12:46):**  So that's fascinating.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:12:49):**  And what were some of the biggest or most common mistakes that you saw growers making  
**[0:12:54-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:12:54):**  in each of those three categories?  
**[0:12:56-0:12:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:12:56):**  I would imagine some patterns started to emerge.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:12:59):**  There are.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:13:00):**  So in the financial aspect, it's just basic financial literacy.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:13:05):**  Like I have my three key areas in financial management, cashflow budgeting, knowing what  
**[0:13:10-0:13:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:13:10):**  your net worth is or your balance sheet, and also understanding profit, what drives profit  
**[0:13:16-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:13:16):**  in the business.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:13:17):**  In the human aspect, it's really about having a growth mindset and being able to question  
**[0:13:24-0:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:13:24):**  and become aware of that.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:13:26):**  But also the health and well-being of the people involved is really key.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:13:30):**  And the relationship skills, you know, those are really great areas to manage.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:13:35):**  But a lot of farm exits here are relationship breakdown focus.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:13:39):**  So, you know, if we're going to be regenerative, we need to manage our people.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:13:44):**  And if we're running the human side down, we end up exploiting ourselves and others  
**[0:13:48-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:13:48):**  to create that viability.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:13:51):**  So those were the my three keys there.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:13:54):**  And in the natural capital, it really comes down to like your ground cover, your soil  
**[0:13:58-0:14:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:13:58):**  organic matter, and also the rainfall use efficiency.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:14:01):**  So those were, you know, I have those sort of three keys within my three areas that I  
**[0:14:06-0:14:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:14:06):**  work with with my clients on resilience.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:14:08):**  That's like, I call that almost the key to farm resilience.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:14:11):**  It's also the key to, you know, viability too, is understanding those.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:14:16):**  But those can just, you could just keep taking it deeper and deeper, couldn't you?  
**[0:14:20-0:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:14:20):**  There's so many aspects to them all.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:14:23):**  For sure.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:14:25):**  And you mentioned a little bit of a mindset shift there.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:14:28):**  And I'm wondering what is required before you get your finances under control to understand  
**[0:14:34-0:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:14:34):**  in order to build towards a profitable farm business if that mindset aspect is lacking?  
**[0:14:39-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:14:39):**  Yeah, mindset's huge.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:14:42):**  And I think the first thing is being able to see holistically, like, if we just focus  
**[0:14:46-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:14:46):**  on making money, we can accidentally and unintentionally degrade our people resources and our natural  
**[0:14:53-0:14:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:14:53):**  capital.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:14:54):**  You know, like, that's if we're only focused there, because there's many forms of capital,  
**[0:14:58-0:15:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:14:58):**  not just financial.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:15:00):**  If we, you know, if we don't focus holistically, like I said, we could exploit the people side  
**[0:15:06-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:15:06):**  or mine our natural capital.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:15:08):**  So it's really important to see holistically.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:15:11):**  It's also important, I think, to get us become aware like that growth mindset's about being  
**[0:15:16-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:15:16):**  able to learn and grow and question our thinking.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:15:19):**  So it's really important to shift out of scarcity mindset.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:15:23):**  Which a lot of us, I don't know, I'm talking from my Australian context, but there's a real  
**[0:15:26-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:15:26):**  scarcity mindset in farming communities.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:15:29):**  And I've grown up in farming family, you know, of money doesn't grow on trees and that sort  
**[0:15:34-0:15:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:15:34):**  of stuff.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:15:35):**  So and, you know, rural people are resourceful, they know how to stretch a dollar.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:15:39):**  And so, you know, and there's nothing wrong with that.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:15:41):**  But sometimes when we're in a scarcity mindset, we're actually limiting ourselves, we're coming  
**[0:15:47-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:15:47):**  at a focus of not being enough, not having enough, needing more land, more inputs, more  
**[0:15:52-0:15:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:15:52):**  information, more, more, more, you know, like, and that can end up on a consumption cycle.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:15:58):**  So we also, when we're in that scarcity mindset, we look for one right answer, we don't see  
**[0:16:03-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:16:03):**  possibilities.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:16:04):**  And we also, you know, it's win lose, not win win.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:16:08):**  It's really about consumption and control.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:16:10):**  When we can shift out of that by becoming more aware of our thinking, surrounding ourselves  
**[0:16:15-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:16:15):**  with people that can also help us with that.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:16:17):**  And I guess being, you know, more focused on gratitude for where we're at, we start  
**[0:16:22-0:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:16:22):**  to see the potential rather than the limitations, we get more less fearful about not having  
**[0:16:28-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:16:28):**  enough so we can then improve our financial management.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:16:32):**  And we I don't know, we just get start questioning and see endless possibilities.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:16:36):**  So that mindset's huge, I think, as far as regenerating financials and financial literacy  
**[0:16:42-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:16:42):**  all wrapped into one, isn't it like.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:16:46):**  And I guess, you know, I've seen farmers who want to take a more regenerative path convinced  
**[0:16:52-0:16:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:16:52):**  it's going to cost them a heap of money.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:16:54):**  So what do they do?  
**[0:16:55-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:16:55):**  They spend a heap of money.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:16:58):**  Is that necessarily so?  
**[0:17:00-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:17:00):**  You know, so our mindset and our beliefs, we've got to be really mindful of that, I  
**[0:17:04-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:17:04):**  think.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:17:05):**  Yeah, that makes total sense.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:17:07):**  And I'm wondering, from a financial perspective, what are some of the specific strategies and  
**[0:17:13-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:17:13):**  techniques that you have found most helpful in guiding people through the financial planning  
**[0:17:18-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:17:18):**  process, especially if they're new to it?  
**[0:17:20-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:17:20):**  Like, where do they start?  
**[0:17:22-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:17:22):**  Yeah, yeah, that's a great question.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:17:25):**  I think it's really important to start when I first sit down with a person and I'm working  
**[0:17:30-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:17:30):**  on a business level, I'll start to look at what is their balance sheet, the statement  
**[0:17:35-0:17:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:17:35):**  of assets and liabilities, to start to see the level of risk that business is carrying  
**[0:17:40-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:17:40):**  and understand what you own versus what you owe.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:17:43):**  So you can manage that.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:17:45):**  And if you focus on net worth, what we focus on grows.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:17:49):**  So having that as a focus on not to build wealth over time, but it's also the risk level  
**[0:17:55-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:17:55):**  of our business.  
**[0:17:56-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:17:56):**  It's what the banks look at.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:17:57):**  It's what we need to understand what it means.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:18:00):**  And we need to be monitoring that.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:18:02):**  So that's often a good place to start.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:18:05):**  The next essential is to do a cash flow budget.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:18:07):**  And budgets aren't the most exciting thing to spend time doing, but they enable us to  
**[0:18:12-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:18:12):**  do what we love.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:18:13):**  Because if we don't monitor our cash flow, then we could be like driving a car without  
**[0:18:18-0:18:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:18:18):**  a fuel gauge.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:18:19):**  We don't know when we're going to run out of money.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:18:22):**  So it's essential in every single business, not just agriculture.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:18:26):**  Yeah, it's the fuel gauge in the business.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:18:29):**  And I've seen just learning to do a cash flow save businesses.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:18:33):**  But that one skill has made someone who was on shaky ground, more confident in their decisions.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:18:40):**  And you know, they're still in business now through learning that skill.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:18:44):**  A lot of people borrow money and banks may help do budgets or other people may do budgets  
**[0:18:48-0:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:18:48):**  for you.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:18:49):**  But you really need that skill for yourself and to use it as a working document and review  
**[0:18:53-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:18:53):**  it regularly.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:18:54):**  So you can see what your budget is versus your actuals on a monthly basis.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:18:59):**  That's really good business management.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:19:01):**  And that's going to keep you doing what you love.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:19:03):**  So that's the second thing I try and work with people on and you know, learning to it's  
**[0:19:08-0:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:19:08):**  the money that's coming in and out and making sure we can pay things when they fall due.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:19:13):**  You know, if our cash flow struggles, we can be out of business really quickly.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:19:18):**  But if we can monitor it and make decisions around it, and it's really a great tool for  
**[0:19:22-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:19:22):**  more informed decision making.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:19:24):**  If you're on a regenerative path, you can use that to help you plan your strategy so  
**[0:19:29-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:19:29):**  that it works.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:19:30):**  You know, it's so easy when we want to regenerate land to get so focused on their natural capital  
**[0:19:36-0:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:19:36):**  and take our eye off the financial.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:19:38):**  And it's you know, people will say, oh, that regenerative bag, it's not profitable, it  
**[0:19:42-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:19:42):**  sends you broke or whatever.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:19:44):**  How can healthy soil and healthy people send you broke?  
**[0:19:48-0:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:19:48):**  It's actually that when we stop managing our finances, that's the problem.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:19:52):**  We've got to incorporate good financial management in a transition of this nature.  
**[0:19:56-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:19:56):**  It's essential.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:19:57):**  So yeah, I'm pretty passionate about cash flows.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:20:01):**  Cash flow is notoriously difficult for farms to manage because they're in this unique situation  
**[0:20:06-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:20:06):**  of having a windfall of cash at harvest time, or perhaps one or two key points in the growing  
**[0:20:13-0:20:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:20:13):**  season.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:20:14):**  And all of the expenses tend to happen in the beginning and maintenance all throughout.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:20:19):**  And yeah, I mean, that's very hard to wrap your head around from a business perspective.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:20:24):**  How do you start to square the calculations when you're at such an unbalance of cash flow?  
**[0:20:32-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:20:32):**  And that's why it's so essential to do.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:20:34):**  Just because you've got money in the bank today, doesn't mean you can, you know, in  
**[0:20:38-0:20:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:20:38):**  three months time, if you just go blow it all, that you will be able to manage your  
**[0:20:43-0:20:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:20:43):**  business.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:20:44):**  So you've really got to have that sense of what that's allocated for.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:20:47):**  Because some of it's spent on things in the future just to keep you running and keep you  
**[0:20:51-0:20:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:20:51):**  going, isn't it?  
**[0:20:52-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:20:52):**  So yeah.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:20:53):**  I wish I had a dollar.  
**[0:20:54-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:20:54):**  I'm sure too on the projections on what they're going to be earning.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:21:01):**  And in an industry that's so uncertain, that has so many variables that could completely  
**[0:21:05-0:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:21:05):**  wipe out a crop, you're starting from a point where you're assuming things, I guess, are  
**[0:21:11-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:21:11):**  going to go at least fairly well, that you're going to have something to sell by the end  
**[0:21:15-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:21:15):**  of the season.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:21:16):**  And that's a variable that must be really hard to base calculations on.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:21:21):**  How do you overcome that part?  
**[0:21:23-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:21:23):**  That's a really good point.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:21:25):**  And I think how I overcome it is, I've often heard, I wish I had a dollar for every time  
**[0:21:30-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:21:30):**  a farmer said cash flows don't work.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:21:34):**  But they do.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:21:35):**  What you can do is get, the more you do it, the better you get at estimating your expenses.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:21:40):**  Because the expenses are our decisions.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:21:42):**  So we can really get accurate on the expense side.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:21:45):**  And we can know that the income sometimes is variable.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:21:48):**  But at least if we know our expenses, when something shifts, like a disaster hits our  
**[0:21:52-0:21:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:21:52):**  crop, we get hailed out or, you know, I had an incidence of a shot and sprung barley crop  
**[0:21:57-0:21:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:21:57):**  one year, that was pretty disastrous.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:21:59):**  And I could take that budget and pull out that figure and look at my options, you know,  
**[0:22:03-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:22:03):**  so it's really like, well, we can often be very, you know, it's hard to always get the  
**[0:22:09-0:22:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:22:09):**  income right.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:22:10):**  But the more you budget, the more accurate your expenses will be.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:22:13):**  And I've seen this in practice with farmers that when I get them on this, they get really  
**[0:22:18-0:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:22:18):**  accurate with expenses.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:22:19):**  And the trick is not overestimating the income and just trying to be realistic because we  
**[0:22:24-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:22:24):**  all want it to really work well, but really pulling yourself into realistic projections  
**[0:22:29-0:22:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:22:29):**  with incomes is really essential.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:22:31):**  And you get better at this.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:22:32):**  It's like riding a bike, you get better at it the more you do it.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:22:35):**  And you know, you have to move the tools and use the budget.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:22:38):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:22:39):**  Yeah, that goes back to the importance of what you're saying before is constant monitoring,  
**[0:22:43-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:22:43):**  especially if you're new to this process, you're not going to get accurate information  
**[0:22:46-0:22:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:22:46):**  from the beginning if you're not paying attention to the projections that you set out and how  
**[0:22:50-0:22:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:22:50):**  they actually square in the calculations along the way.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:22:53):**  Right.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:22:54):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:55-0:22:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:22:55):**  And you can get hung up like, you know, decision making in agriculture is quite complex.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:22:59):**  So sometimes people put off a decision because they don't know what's the right answer.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:23:03):**  But sometimes, you know, you're never going to know what's right or wrong.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:23:06):**  But if you can make an informed decision based on the best information at the time, that's  
**[0:23:11-0:23:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:23:11):**  the best policy.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:23:12):**  And that's what your cash flow provides you.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:23:14):**  So particularly, you know, transitioning towards regenerative systems, this stuff's really  
**[0:23:19-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:23:19):**  crucial.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:23:20):**  And it helps you to manage that aspect of your business to keep you afloat while you  
**[0:23:24-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:23:24):**  implement changes and do in the way you do things.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:23:27):**  So yeah, it's really important.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:23:29):**  And beyond cash flow, I think it's really essential for people to know what profit is,  
**[0:23:35-0:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:23:35):**  because so many farmers are focused on production.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:23:38):**  Like, you know, they, over here in Australia, they'll measure their success by topping the  
**[0:23:43-0:23:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:23:43):**  sale of the cattle sale, or, you know, best yielding crop.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:23:48):**  But I want to know, did that make you money?  
**[0:23:50-0:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:23:50):**  Or did you spend more than that on on costs like this is what we don't talk about.  
**[0:23:55-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:23:55):**  More and more people are starting to talk profit, but understanding what profit is,  
**[0:24:00-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:24:00):**  where it comes from and understanding, you know, that's your cash flow drives that fuel

**[0:24:08-0:24:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:24:08):**  living expenses, debt reduction, investment back in your business.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:24:12):**  So that's the other keys, educating around profit and profitability.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:24:16):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:24:17):**  Yeah, because it really is the difference between what you make and what it took, or  
**[0:24:23-0:24:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:24:23):**  what you had to spend in order to make that.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:24:26):**  And there is a tendency not only in farming in most businesses, to project what you were  
**[0:24:32-0:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:24:32):**  likely to make, and then just rise your expenditure to more or less meet that.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:24:38):**  And you know, okay, well, I know I'm going to make this much, or I think I'm going to  
**[0:24:42-0:24:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:24:42):**  make this much.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:24:43):**  So that gives me the opportunity to spend, spend, spend and invest in all these other  
**[0:24:46-0:24:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:24:46):**  things.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:24:47):**  And then by the end, there's no margin.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:24:49):**  And especially if you don't end up making what you projected that you will then you  
**[0:24:52-0:24:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:24:52):**  get into trouble, you start to get into debt.  
**[0:24:55-0:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:24:55):**  How do you coach people to get out of that portion of the mindset?  
**[0:24:58-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:24:58):**  Oh, that's a really interesting one.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:25:00):**  It is just learning about what profit is.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:25:02):**  And where does it come from?  
**[0:25:03-0:25:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:25:03):**  And where does it go?  
**[0:25:04-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:25:04):**  Because I've seen people who don't understand the difference between cash flow and profit.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:25:07):**  They think profit's what's in the bank account.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:25:09):**  Well, no, it's not.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:25:11):**  It's how you use what's in the bank account.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:25:13):**  Because I've seen people pay off say like a tractor loan or something and then come  
**[0:25:17-0:25:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:25:17):**  to me worried the accountants made a mistake.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:25:20):**  And they've changed accountants because they wanted a cheaper one.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:25:22):**  And oh, no, I think they've done it all wrong.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:25:24):**  And I'm like, hang on, what's happened?  
**[0:25:26-0:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:25:26):**  Well, you paid off, you know, $40,000 on a tractor loan, that's profit, like to make  
**[0:25:31-0:25:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:25:31):**  a debt reduction, that's profit.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:25:33):**  So you know, it's understanding when you make those decisions, how that's going to be dealt  
**[0:25:38-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:25:38):**  with in your tax obligations, which are very in different countries, but that's how it's  
**[0:25:43-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:25:43):**  dealt with here.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:25:45):**  It's essential.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:25:46):**  So I guess it's just education, like this is profit and off the way I set out cash flow  
**[0:25:51-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:25:51):**  budgets, I try and separate costs out to show people quickly where those things are, rather  
**[0:25:56-0:25:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:25:56):**  than have them lost in a big spreadsheet.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:25:58):**  I'll sort of separate enterprise costs, overhead costs, financial costs, taxable costs out.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:26:05):**  So people as they work with me are learning what those things are, what the implications  
**[0:26:10-0:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:26:10):**  of them are, and getting okay.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:26:12):**  Like, you know, farmers have a mindset of avoiding profits, they don't want to pay tax.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:26:17):**  But you know, how are you going to get ahead without it?  
**[0:26:19-0:26:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:26:19):**  You've got to come to terms with the fact that tax is good.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:26:22):**  Because you're making money.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:26:24):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:26:25):**  Yeah, that makes sense.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:26:26):**  That's counterintuitive, but it's a good way to look at it.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:26:29):**  It's the scarcity mindset in action.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:26:31):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:26:32):**  You can't avoid tax, spending money on tax deductible items, but at the end of the day,  
**[0:26:37-0:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:26:37):**  profit is what builds your wealth.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:26:39):**  And that's what builds your your balance sheet and your net worth.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:26:42):**  So it's a good thing.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:26:43):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:26:44):**  So that's, you know, those are the things I work with, I guess on building financial  
**[0:26:48-0:26:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:26:48):**  literacy and business skills and confidence.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:26:50):**  And once people have those, and to control the next level is understanding the enterprises  
**[0:26:55-0:26:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:26:55):**  in the business and looking at the cost of production.  
**[0:26:57-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:26:57):**  But you know, what does it cost me to produce a tonne of grain?  
**[0:27:01-0:27:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:27:01):**  What does it cost me to produce a kilo of beef?  
**[0:27:04-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:27:04):**  Because they all know what they get paid for that kilo of beef, but they rarely know what  
**[0:27:09-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:27:09):**  it costs them to produce.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:27:10):**  And so then you drill down in that and that just builds another whole layer of financial  
**[0:27:15-0:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:27:15):**  aptitude in those first three are kind of the essentials, but you need to drill down  
**[0:27:21-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:27:21):**  into your enterprises and your gross margins and cost of production to make sure that you're  
**[0:27:27-0:27:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:27:27):**  running a business that's effective.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:27:28):**  And it could be things you could fine tune.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:27:31):**  That's where they're going to become obvious.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:27:33):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:27:34):**  So I guess those are my essentials.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:27:38):**  And I would imagine that you look at expenditure in different ways, too, because there are  
**[0:27:42-0:27:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:27:42):**  maintenance costs, there are the sort of things that can actually make you money or wealth  
**[0:27:46-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:27:46):**  generating expenditure.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:27:48):**  Do you put a lot of effort into separating those two and looking at them differently?  
**[0:27:54-0:27:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:27:54):**  Or do you kind of lump the expenditures together?  
**[0:27:56-0:27:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:27:56):**  Yeah, that's a good question.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:27:58):**  I think I encourage farmers to really pay attention to accounting, like management accounting,  
**[0:28:04-0:28:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:28:04):**  not just tax accounting.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:28:05):**  And part of that is to dissect out their costs as much as possible, not lump them into things,  
**[0:28:11-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:28:11):**  because then they can make better management decisions.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:28:13):**  A lot of people just do like accounting because they have to for tax.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:28:17):**  And you've got all this data that you could be using to run your business better if you  
**[0:28:21-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:28:21):**  know how to get it out.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:28:22):**  So having a good chart of accounts and having a good, I guess, separating all the expenses  
**[0:28:27-0:28:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:28:27):**  off as much as possible so you can fine tune and drill down into what's going on.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:28:32):**  So with the wealth generating, you'd want to have everything itemized so you know exactly  
**[0:28:37-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:28:37):**  what's going where.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:28:39):**  I think that's just essential.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:28:41):**  And then you're making better decisions.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:28:44):**  So when I do cash flows, I try and separate that stuff out.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:28:48):**  And particularly, I like to separate out the financial costs because sometimes people aren't  
**[0:28:52-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:28:52):**  aware just how much of the income is just going straight to the bank before they can  
**[0:28:56-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:28:56):**  use it.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:28:57):**  So how do you, you know, you need to know what you've got to cover as a base every month  
**[0:29:01-0:29:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:29:01):**  before you get to spend anything.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:29:03):**  And also what if you've got a goal around wealth generation, I think the biggest tip  
**[0:29:08-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:29:08):**  I've got is to actually set a smart goal around it.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:29:11):**  Because you know, a lot of farmers will say, my goal is to reduce debt.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:29:16):**  And every year the goal is to reduce debt, but nothing's changed.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:29:19):**  But once you get specific and measurable and achievable and realistic, and you put a timeframe  
**[0:29:24-0:29:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:29:24):**  on it, and suddenly you can say, I will reduce my debt by $10,000 by June, you know, and  
**[0:29:30-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:29:30):**  suddenly it can happen and you check that that's achievable.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:29:33):**  That's a really big tip for managing money and reducing debt or wealth generation goals  
**[0:29:38-0:29:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:29:38):**  and or debt reduction or building asset, get smarter around it and get specific and measurable  
**[0:29:44-0:29:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:29:44):**  and put timeframes on it that fit, put them in your budget, make sure it's achievable.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:29:49):**  Because otherwise you'll hear yourself saying I'm going to do this for 10 years and nothing  
**[0:29:52-0:29:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:29:52):**  will shift.  
**[0:29:53-0:29:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:29:53):**  So yeah, it's that's how smart goal principle really applies to financial goals, I think,  
**[0:29:59-0:30:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:29:59):**  make sure it's, you know, achievable little chunk it down into achievable steps.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:30:02):**  But yeah, that's a really key.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:30:04):**  Am I getting off track?  
**[0:30:05-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:30:05):**  No, not at all.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:30:06):**  That's really essential advice.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:30:07):**  And I mean, it applies to so many things, but especially for people who see financial  
**[0:30:14-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:30:14):**  management as an overwhelming task, right?  
**[0:30:17-0:30:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:30:17):**  Perhaps it's something that they are don't feel like they're very good at doing or it  
**[0:30:21-0:30:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:30:21):**  just seems like this insurmountable thing that they prefer to offload to someone else.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:30:26):**  Like you're saying there's so much potential learning and the ability to improve your management  
**[0:30:31-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:30:31):**  hidden in those numbers once you learn how to decipher them.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:30:34):**  And as soon as you start to measure it, then you can manage it.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:30:37):**  That's one of my favorite sayings in the business world, right?  
**[0:30:41-0:30:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:30:41):**  What gets measured gets managed.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:30:43):**  And it really does come down to management.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:30:45):**  That's all we really have access to here.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:30:47):**  And it's the only way that we can start to correct course in those manageable chunks  
**[0:30:52-0:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:30:52):**  that take the overwhelm out of the big job of getting a farm back into a profitable state.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:30:58):**  And we've been talking a lot about the mindset portion right now, which is absolutely essential.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:31:03):**  But can you break it down to some tangible skills that are worth developing in order  
**[0:31:08-0:31:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:31:08):**  to get good at this and also to reduce some of that overwhelm that we were just talking  
**[0:31:13-0:31:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:31:13):**  about?  
**[0:31:14-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:31:14):**  Yeah, I think the skills are probably just getting comfortable.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:31:20):**  Well, first with your figures, budgeting, like I can't emphasize enough how important  
**[0:31:26-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:31:26):**  it is to have a cashflow projection for 12 months.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:31:28):**  It's very hard to predict longer, but you can sort of do that in a more general way.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:31:34):**  I have a really general five year forecast, but a really detailed 12 month.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:31:38):**  And I think treat those documents like sometimes we'll do business plans or financial budgeting,  
**[0:31:45-0:31:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:31:45):**  financial spreadsheets, and the job's done.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:31:47):**  We don't look at it again.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:31:48):**  We'll do it for a specific purpose or when someone asks us for it.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:31:52):**  But when we do it for our own purposes, the whole thing is to get into a routine of actually  
**[0:31:56-0:31:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:31:56):**  making them working documents, not sticking them away and ignoring them.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:31:59):**  Because where the rubber hits the road is to commit to a regular review of those figures  
**[0:32:05-0:32:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:32:05):**  and make it painless.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:32:07):**  Like here in Australia, we report quarterly on GST.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:32:10):**  So that's a really good time to have a good review of the process.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:32:14):**  Everything's up to date.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:32:15):**  Everything's current.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:32:16):**  You know, make it a quarterly thing that you review at least.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:32:19):**  But I think when we're dealing with transitions or we're dealing with, you know, the more  
**[0:32:25-0:32:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:32:25):**  stressed we are financially, the more we have to look at this stuff, the more time we need  
**[0:32:29-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:32:29):**  to dedicate to it.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:32:30):**  So it's building in regular actuals versus projections.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:32:34):**  Where am I out?  
**[0:32:35-0:32:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:32:35):**  As we do that, we learn more and more about our business, our costs, where things are  
**[0:32:41-0:32:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:32:41):**  going, what's happening, you know.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:32:43):**  And I think, you know, the core skills are also that budget will tell you so much about  
**[0:32:48-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:32:48):**  your business.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:32:49):**  I can't reinforce it enough.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:32:51):**  I once had some clients who decided they would go all in and increase, they increase the  
**[0:32:56-0:32:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:32:56):**  turnover, like the income in their business, increase tenfold.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:32:59):**  So for example, instead of breeding cattle and making $100,000 gross income, not profit,  
**[0:33:05-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:33:05):**  but income for the year, they then started, you know, backgrounding and feeding and ramping  
**[0:33:10-0:33:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:33:10):**  up production so that, you know, tenfold million dollars income a year.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:33:15):**  Looks like there's a lot of money coming in.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:33:17):**  This is a lot of volume.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:33:18):**  If you don't start to look beyond that, you start, don't see.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:33:23):**  And there's a lot of work.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:33:25):**  The stock agent was happy because there was ten times the commission, however, when we  
**[0:33:30-0:33:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:33:30):**  did the budget, there was the exact same profit.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:33:34):**  So this is where, you know, all this extra work and yes, all these people were benefiting  
**[0:33:41-0:33:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:33:41):**  from this system, but the farmer wasn't.  
**[0:33:43-0:33:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:33:43):**  So get to know your numbers really carefully.  
**[0:33:46-0:33:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:33:46):**  You can't avoid it.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:33:47):**  There's no real hack for it other than doing the work and moving the tools.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:33:52):**  And I guess finding someone who can help you learn to do a cashflow if you aren't over  
**[0:33:57-0:34:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:33:57):**  that, find someone who can help you put that together and will walk you through it and  
**[0:34:01-0:34:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:34:01):**  support you while you learn.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:34:03):**  You know, it's just an essential skill.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:34:07):**  Start with that.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:34:09):**  And you can tell I love cashflow budgeting because I love the outcomes I've seen it create  
**[0:34:13-0:34:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:34:13):**  for people.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:34:14):**  I've seen it change people's lives.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:34:15):**  Like one farmer looked at it, he'd never actually looked at what he was doing.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:34:19):**  And he rang me the next day, said, I'm selling the farm and I'm like, oh, what have I done?  
**[0:34:24-0:34:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:34:24):**  Like he's really, he's going.  
**[0:34:26-0:34:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:34:26):**  And he said, I've never looked at what I'm doing like this.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:34:29):**  And I've realized there's no point in this.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:34:31):**  I'm working really hard and I'm not getting anywhere.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:34:33):**  It's got to be a better way.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:34:35):**  So I said to him, well, you know, a cashflow budget is only as good as the figures we put  
**[0:34:39-0:34:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:34:39):**  into it.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:34:40):**  So your job now is to go through those figures and make sure they're realistic and you're  
**[0:34:44-0:34:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:34:44):**  happy with them because you're basing a major life decision on this budget.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:34:48):**  So, you know, go through them, make sure it's right.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:34:51):**  And he did sell and he avoided some pretty tricky times ahead, but yeah, it can be really  
**[0:34:57-0:35:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:34:57):**  eye opening for people who've never sat through it.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:35:01):**  Just how life changing looking at this stuff can be as far as, you know, informing decisions  
**[0:35:05-0:35:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:35:05):**  and realizing that a lot of income doesn't mean a lot of profit or, you know, we get  
**[0:35:10-0:35:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:35:10):**  tied into thinking it's all production, don't we?  
**[0:35:13-0:35:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:35:13):**  Like we've got to just do more, more, more.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:35:16):**  And that mindset actually stops a lot of people embracing regenerative practices because they  
**[0:35:21-0:35:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:35:21):**  equate more income with more money, but they haven't looked at their profit and they haven't  
**[0:35:26-0:35:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:35:26):**  looked at it in the domains of the people and the natural capital as well.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:35:29):**  So yeah, I think just, you know, start to just do the numbers, start with the cashflow  
**[0:35:35-0:35:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:35:35):**  budget.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:35:36):**  And build from there, start simply.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:35:40):**  And I don't know if you've observed the same thing as I have, but a lot of the most profitable  
**[0:35:44-0:35:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:35:44):**  enterprises are actually small and intensive and niche down.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:35:48):**  And there seems to be this concept that in order to make more money, you just have to  
**[0:35:54-0:35:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:35:54):**  get bigger and you have to expand, you have to scale your operation.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:35:57):**  Whereas, you know, if the individual units that you're selling or the yields that you're  
**[0:36:02-0:36:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:36:02):**  putting out by the end require so much input, scaling up is actually exactly what you don't  
**[0:36:09-0:36:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:36:09):**  want to do.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:36:10):**  It's going to increase the overhead costs and especially as things get larger, they  
**[0:36:15-0:36:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:36:15):**  get more difficult to manage.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:36:18):**  And that means that you're going to start to lose efficiency in that process and oftentimes  
**[0:36:22-0:36:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:36:22):**  niching down, getting intensive, getting efficient, and maybe finding a new sales outlet, going  
**[0:36:30-0:36:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:36:30):**  direct to the end user or the client and, you know, specializing more can often be a  
**[0:36:37-0:36:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:36:37):**  lot more profitable than that scale model.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:36:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:36:40):**  And that's why it's so important to look at your profit, you know, and understand your  
**[0:36:44-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:36:44):**  cost of production and where everything, how all this pieces together, because then you  
**[0:36:49-0:36:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:36:49):**  can make better decisions.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:36:51):**  You know, more land isn't necessarily the way to go.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:36:54):**  Land's getting more and more expensive.  
**[0:36:56-0:37:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:36:56):**  Sometimes you're better off using what you have better and, you know, doing what you  
**[0:37:00-0:37:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:37:00):**  can do better with the resources you already have.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:37:03):**  So those are where those decisions really come in.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:37:06):**  And if we aren't careful, we can get trapped in that, that scarcity mindset of thinking  
**[0:37:11-0:37:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:37:11):**  we don't have enough.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:37:12):**  Oh, we need more of something rather than sometimes it's doing less of something or  
**[0:37:16-0:37:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:37:16):**  doing something better, you know.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:37:18):**  How can I do this better?  
**[0:37:20-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:37:20):**  And can, you know, that's where knowing your numbers comes in and it helps you really make  
**[0:37:25-0:37:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:37:25):**  informed decisions.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:37:26):**  I've seen so many cases of people who think that getting bigger will solve their problems.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:37:31):**  Yet on paper is one thing you can make anything look good on paper.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:37:35):**  If you don't make that plan, a living, working, breathing document and follow it and adapt  
**[0:37:41-0:37:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:37:41):**  it and keep tuned into it, it can be the downfall of a business.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:37:46):**  So, you know, sometimes it's the thing that makes it work.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:37:49):**  It's just knowing the numbers.  
**[0:37:51-0:37:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:37:51):**  You know, you can't say that's always the case.  
**[0:37:53-0:37:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:37:53):**  Sometimes you need to get bigger and you need to scale up and you need the numbers to work.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:37:59):**  But if you don't use those numbers and, you know, use them to help you inform you and  
**[0:38:05-0:38:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:38:05):**  find your way.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:38:06):**  It's like I said, it's the fuel gauge.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:38:07):**  You just run out of fuel.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:38:09):**  It's a real shame because I've seen farmers who are really skilled at what they do.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:38:14):**  But if they're not managing their business well, and it goes for all of us in business,  
**[0:38:17-0:38:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:38:17):**  actually, we can be really good at what we do.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:38:19):**  If we don't manage the business side and the financial aspect, we can be not able to do  
**[0:38:25-0:38:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:38:25):**  our magic in the world.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:38:26):**  What we are most good at can't express itself if we can't survive financially, you know.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:38:32):**  So it's really important for everyone in business, us as, you know, coaches or consultants, as  
**[0:38:37-0:38:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:38:37):**  well as our farmers to manage this stuff.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:38:40):**  Yeah, like you keep coming back to this holistic way of looking at things.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:38:43):**  We may be regenerating the ecosystem with our management practices, but if we're not  
**[0:38:48-0:38:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:38:48):**  keeping the business solvent and we're not managing the personnel or interacting with  
**[0:38:53-0:38:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:38:53):**  our community in a way that's regenerative, then that's only one portion of the calculation.  
**[0:38:58-0:39:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:38:58):**  And it's really important to make sure that it's working in all those other aspects.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:39:01):**  Yeah.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:39:02):**  Now, let's take a look at resilience of a farm business as well, because as the old  
**[0:39:09-0:39:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:39:09):**  adage says, you don't necessarily want to put all of your eggs in one basket.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:39:12):**  And a lot of farms work that way, right?  
**[0:39:15-0:39:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:39:15):**  If it's just one crop or, you know, a single enterprise that you're dependent on.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:39:19):**  I mean, we already talked about all the different variables that can screw up those projections  
**[0:39:25-0:39:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:39:25):**  and can wipe out a crop.  
**[0:39:27-0:39:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:39:27):**  Do you advocate for people diversifying the enterprises and the income streams that they  
**[0:39:33-0:39:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:39:33):**  have in order to build resilience in the business model?  
**[0:39:36-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:39:36):**  Yeah, that's probably a it depends answer, because I think you're very true.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:39:41):**  Like when we have all our eggs in one basket, we're very vulnerable to change.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:39:45):**  However, maybe that diversity comes in other forms like off farm assets or some people,  
**[0:39:51-0:39:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:39:51):**  their diversity is in off farm income.  
**[0:39:53-0:39:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:39:53):**  You know, it can take many forms, but I've noticed here in the area I live, a lot of  
**[0:39:58-0:40:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:39:58):**  people have just now run beef cattle only, rather than, you know, they might have had  
**[0:40:03-0:40:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:40:03):**  sheep or and cattle and crops, but as the farming age has increased, they've tried to  
**[0:40:08-0:40:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:40:08):**  streamline by going just beef cattle.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:40:10):**  And we had a live export ban here a few years ago, which really created a lot of hiccups  
**[0:40:15-0:40:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:40:15):**  for that industry, especially when that's people's sole source of income.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:40:20):**  So diversification is essential in risk management.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:40:23):**  It adds a layer of complexity, but it has to be underpinned by good financial literacy.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:40:29):**  Because again, you know, we can, I've seen people try and buy a farm in a different geographical  
**[0:40:35-0:40:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:40:35):**  area to kind of manage their, you know, diversification can take enterprise form or it could take  
**[0:40:40-0:40:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:40:40):**  climate and, you know, different climate zone form for some people.  
**[0:40:45-0:40:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:40:45):**  If they don't manage that well, it can pull things down.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:40:48):**  But also if we get too diverse and we don't have the strengths or the people skills or  
**[0:40:53-0:40:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:40:53):**  the manpower, then we can pull it down too.  
**[0:40:57-0:41:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:40:57):**  So we're not able to, you know, it's really got to be aligned with good financial management,  
**[0:41:01-0:41:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:41:01):**  proactive and also the strengths of our team.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:41:06):**  So, and the people involved, because, you know, a lot of people, when we get on a regenerative  
**[0:41:11-0:41:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:41:11):**  path, we can accidentally degenerate our human capital by working ourselves down and running  
**[0:41:17-0:41:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:41:17):**  our own wellbeing down to try and make it all work.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:41:21):**  And because we believe in it so much, we're passionate about it, but you know, we're not  
**[0:41:25-0:41:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:41:25):**  regenerative if we're not looking after ourselves as well.  
**[0:41:28-0:41:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:41:28):**  So, and as you said before, if we're not making a financial profit, we can't really claim  
**[0:41:33-0:41:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:41:33):**  to be regenerative either.  
**[0:41:34-0:41:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:41:34):**  Like we've got to be building all of our bank accounts up, not just the money, but the people  
**[0:41:40-0:41:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:41:40):**  and the land and the things that are more valuable than money really.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:41:45):**  So yeah, it's an interesting one, diversification, because you really do, I think it's really  
**[0:41:51-0:41:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:41:51):**  important, but I mean, maybe it's about what kind of diversification is most appropriate  
**[0:41:56-0:42:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:41:56):**  for these people in their context is probably more important than just diversity for diversity's  
**[0:42:02-0:42:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:42:02):**  sake.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:42:03):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:42:04):**  Yeah, that's very well said.  
**[0:42:07-0:42:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:42:07):**  But let's go into a hypothetical situation where someone is looking at a new enterprise  
**[0:42:11-0:42:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:42:11):**  for their farm in order to build some resilience, diversify a little bit.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:42:16):**  Where should they start in assessing the viability of that enterprise and how it fits in with  
**[0:42:21-0:42:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:42:21):**  a goal towards profitability for the whole farm business?  
**[0:42:24-0:42:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:42:24):**  Yeah, well, again, the first thing I would do is, well, firstly, you've got to assess,  
**[0:42:30-0:42:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:42:30):**  does that mean more debt?  
**[0:42:31-0:42:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:42:31):**  And how does that, how does that sit with your balance sheet, your statement of assets  
**[0:42:36-0:42:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:42:36):**  and liabilities and your net worth?  
**[0:42:38-0:42:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:42:38):**  How does that fit with the risk that that poses?  
**[0:42:41-0:42:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:42:41):**  And then does this fit with our cash flow projection?  
**[0:42:44-0:42:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:42:44):**  Can we keep our, can we service our debt?  
**[0:42:46-0:42:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:42:46):**  Can we invest?  
**[0:42:47-0:42:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:42:47):**  Do we have the money to invest in this?  
**[0:42:49-0:42:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:42:49):**  What does it need from us?  
**[0:42:51-0:42:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:42:51):**  What time does it require as well?  
**[0:42:54-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:42:54):**  You know, that's also not in the budget, but time is just as essential as money, really.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:43:01):**  And start to, you know, I generally say to people, if you've always got a cash flow budget  
**[0:43:05-0:43:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:43:05):**  up to date and ready, you put this in there and you run scenarios through it.  
**[0:43:10-0:43:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:43:10):**  So forecasting is powerful stuff.  
**[0:43:13-0:43:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:43:13):**  And the minute you have an idea, well, what if I went and did something different?  
**[0:43:17-0:43:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:43:17):**  You can run the numbers through there and see how it stacks up.  
**[0:43:20-0:43:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:43:20):**  You can get an instant feedback just through that spreadsheet.  
**[0:43:23-0:43:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:43:23):**  If that spreadsheet is up to date and working and really good, the more you do it, the better  
**[0:43:27-0:43:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:43:27):**  you get at it.  
**[0:43:28-0:43:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:43:28):**  So that's the first thing I would do.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:43:30):**  And then it's probably to look at the gross margin and say, you know, what is the enterprise?  
**[0:43:35-0:43:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:43:35):**  What are the costs associated specifically with this enterprise?  
**[0:43:39-0:43:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:43:39):**  What are its specific expenses?  
**[0:43:41-0:43:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:43:41):**  And then you can compare it to the existing enterprises or alternatives.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:43:46):**  So understanding that will give you all you need to know about.  
**[0:43:50-0:43:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:43:50):**  You've also got to factor in your strengths and your time.  
**[0:43:54-0:43:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:43:54):**  And you know, sometimes something that might look great on paper in practice, if it doesn't  
**[0:43:59-0:44:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:43:59):**  fit with your vision for your land and your values and your strengths, you might, it could  
**[0:44:04-0:44:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:44:04):**  be a disaster.  
**[0:44:05-0:44:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:44:05):**  So, you know, and that that's where that strategic planning overlays onto financials, knowing  
**[0:44:12-0:44:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:44:12):**  what your vision is, what your context is, what do you value?  
**[0:44:15-0:44:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:44:15):**  You know, what is it that gets you up in every day and working out on the farm?  
**[0:44:21-0:44:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:44:21):**  Like that's the stuff that it's also got to align to beyond money.  
**[0:44:25-0:44:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:44:25):**  But it's also got to stack up for you.  
**[0:44:27-0:44:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:44:27):**  And yeah, I'm probably repeating these tools, but they just, they're simple and they work.  
**[0:44:31-0:44:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:44:31):**  And if you have this stuff, I'm working with some clients at the moment and just getting  
**[0:44:37-0:44:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:44:37):**  them all current with their cash flows mean when things change, you know, they can go  
**[0:44:42-0:44:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:44:42):**  to the bank quickly and be proactive with their requests for some funds rather than  
**[0:44:46-0:44:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:44:46):**  wait till they're running out of money.  
**[0:44:48-0:44:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:44:48):**  Banks much more happy to help you when you can see six months ahead there's an issue  
**[0:44:52-0:44:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:44:52):**  rather than after the event.  
**[0:44:55-0:45:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:44:55):**  So you know, but they can also, you know, take advantage of opportunities because they  
**[0:45:00-0:45:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:45:00):**  know how the fuel gauge is running and how it's going to be performing for the next year  
**[0:45:04-0:45:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:45:04):**  ahead.  
**[0:45:05-0:45:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:45:05):**  So it's really vital if you're looking at changing or adding things in.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:45:12):**  Every change should go through the existing budget that you have as a working document.  
**[0:45:16-0:45:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:45:16):**  And I love it because the minute I get an idea, I can just plug it in and say, oh, how  
**[0:45:21-0:45:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:45:21):**  does it look now?  
**[0:45:22-0:45:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:45:22):**  You know, and you don't have to spend any money to just play with the spreadsheet and  
**[0:45:27-0:45:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:45:27):**  see how it's going to pan out.  
**[0:45:29-0:45:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:45:29):**  It's a really, really good tool.  
**[0:45:30-0:45:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:45:30):**  Yeah.  
**[0:45:31-0:45:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:45:31):**  Yeah.  
**[0:45:32-0:45:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:45:32):**  I can see how useful that is for making difficult decisions because projecting things into the  
**[0:45:36-0:45:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:45:36):**  future in such a risky business with so many variables, as we talked about a few times  
**[0:45:41-0:45:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:45:41):**  is difficult.  
**[0:45:42-0:45:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:45:42):**  And until you have a system for making those types of choices and testing out your ideas  
**[0:45:49-0:45:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:45:49):**  out into the future, it's, you know, it's really, it really is a gamble.  
**[0:45:54-0:45:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:45:54):**  And so aside from, sorry, please go ahead.  
**[0:45:57-0:46:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:45:57):**  It won't take all the risk out of it, but it means that you're doing it with the best  
**[0:46:01-0:46:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:46:01):**  information to hand.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:46:02):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:46:03):**  Yeah, definitely.  
**[0:46:04-0:46:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:46:04):**  And what are some of the other ways that you have found to help to de-risk this line of  
**[0:46:09-0:46:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:46:09):**  work?  
**[0:46:10-0:46:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:46:10):**  We've talked about perhaps diversifying either through other enterprises on the farm or other  
**[0:46:14-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:46:14):**  ways of cash flowing a business, not necessarily adding complexity to the land management itself  
**[0:46:21-0:46:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:46:21):**  and constantly monitoring your financial plan to see how it's going.  
**[0:46:26-0:46:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:46:26):**  Have you found any other techniques that have helped to take some of the risk out of this  
**[0:46:30-0:46:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:46:30):**  inherently risky industry?  
**[0:46:32-0:46:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:46:32):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:33-0:46:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:46:33):**  Well, if we're talking specifically, what I work on now is transitioning farmers who  
**[0:46:37-0:46:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:46:37):**  are transitioning to become more regenerative.  
**[0:46:40-0:46:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:46:40):**  I think the most important thing that goes hand in hand with managing the financials  
**[0:46:44-0:46:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:46:44):**  is having a strategy and getting strategic in your approach.  
**[0:46:48-0:46:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:46:48):**  Because often we get really excited about this.  
**[0:46:50-0:46:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:46:50):**  When we see it, we can't unsee it.  
**[0:46:53-0:46:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:46:53):**  And you only have to stand in a multi-species crop to get excited and want to change.  
**[0:46:57-0:46:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:46:57):**  And it's infectious.  
**[0:46:58-0:47:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:46:58):**  But you kind of people, I noticed a lot of people when I speak to them, they've been  
**[0:47:02-0:47:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:47:02):**  trying all sorts of things randomly, a bit like a scatter gun approach.  
**[0:47:07-0:47:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:47:07):**  And they know it should work.  
**[0:47:08-0:47:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:47:08):**  They believe it should work, but nothing's shifting.  
**[0:47:12-0:47:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:47:12):**  And sometimes it's because they're not being really strategic.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:47:14):**  Like they haven't actually tailored a strategy for their unique context.  
**[0:47:19-0:47:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:47:19):**  And every individual landscape is different.  
**[0:47:22-0:47:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:47:22):**  The farm's different.  
**[0:47:23-0:47:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:47:23):**  The goals of the landowners are different.  
**[0:47:25-0:47:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:47:25):**  What drives those landowners are different or landholders or stewards.  
**[0:47:29-0:47:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:47:29):**  You know, it's all of that.  
**[0:47:30-0:47:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:47:30):**  So really getting strategic and building foundations through the ecosystem services.  
**[0:47:37-0:47:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:47:37):**  That's where it all starts.  
**[0:47:38-0:47:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:47:38):**  And it's not a quick process, but if you don't do that, that's what costs people financially  
**[0:47:44-0:47:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:47:44):**  on this journey.  
**[0:47:45-0:47:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:47:45):**  So really getting strategic, put first things first and map out something that fits your  
**[0:47:51-0:47:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:47:51):**  own context.  
**[0:47:52-0:47:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:47:52):**  And then budget it, work through your financial situation because everyone's financial situation  
**[0:47:58-0:48:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:47:58):**  is also different.  
**[0:48:00-0:48:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:48:00):**  So you can manage the financial risks, but also, you know, make informed decisions about  
**[0:48:05-0:48:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:48:05):**  do I do a whole heap at once?  
**[0:48:07-0:48:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:48:07):**  Do I work on one area at a time?  
**[0:48:10-0:48:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:48:10):**  What's going to work best?  
**[0:48:11-0:48:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:48:11):**  A lot of people get impatient when do everything at once, but you've got to pay your bills.  
**[0:48:14-0:48:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:48:14):**  We want to keep you there.  
**[0:48:16-0:48:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:48:16):**  So, you know, that's where it all comes together, the strategy and then how does it fit with  
**[0:48:20-0:48:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:48:20):**  our reality of our financial situation?  
**[0:48:23-0:48:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:48:23):**  So, yeah, I guess it is getting strategic and finding people who can help you develop  
**[0:48:29-0:48:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:48:29):**  a strategy that fits your context and your goals and your major, you know, the major  
**[0:48:35-0:48:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:48:35):**  levers you need to pull in your system.  
**[0:48:37-0:48:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:48:37):**  Yeah.  
**[0:48:38-0:48:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:48:38):**  All right.  
**[0:48:39-0:48:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:48:39):**  Now I want to talk about perhaps the elephant in the room of financial planning for farms  
**[0:48:43-0:48:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:48:43):**  and that's subsidies.  
**[0:48:46-0:48:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:48:46):**  And there's a lot of talk about whether farms should be working towards weaning off of subsidies  
**[0:48:51-0:48:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:48:51):**  and working towards profitable models to be able to stand on their own.  
**[0:48:55-0:49:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:48:55):**  It seems a lot more feasible for smaller scale farms, at least here in Europe and from the  
**[0:49:00-0:49:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:49:00):**  little that I remember from working in the States, because most of the subsidies start  
**[0:49:04-0:49:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:49:04):**  to kick in at larger land-based enterprises.  
**[0:49:09-0:49:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:49:09):**  What has been your experience of working with farms that factor subsidies as a large portion  
**[0:49:16-0:49:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:49:16):**  of their income and possible profitability?  
**[0:49:19-0:49:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:49:19):**  Is it something that they should be working at moving towards weaning off of for the health  
**[0:49:25-0:49:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:49:25):**  of their business?  
**[0:49:26-0:49:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:49:26):**  Or is it just another element in the financial planning that should be taken into account  
**[0:49:31-0:49:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:49:31):**  and managed like any other?  
**[0:49:32-0:49:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:49:32):**  Yeah, well, firstly, I have to say my context for my work has been Australia.  
**[0:49:38-0:49:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:49:38):**  And here in Australia, we have a mindset of believing that we are the least subsidised  
**[0:49:43-0:49:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:49:43):**  farmers in the world.  
**[0:49:45-0:49:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:49:45):**  However, our farmers still do receive income support.  
**[0:49:49-0:49:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:49:49):**  They do still receive low interest loans from the government.  
**[0:49:53-0:49:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:49:53):**  They still do receive grants at times, mostly now the grants are tied, often tied to natural  
**[0:49:57-0:50:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:49:57):**  disasters, which we're seeing thick and fast at the moment.  
**[0:50:01-0:50:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:50:01):**  So while we might, our subsidy system, I think is just different.  
**[0:50:06-0:50:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:50:06):**  There is still a lot of support.  
**[0:50:08-0:50:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:50:08):**  So my context is probably very different to people listening from the States or Europe  
**[0:50:12-0:50:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:50:12):**  and as far as the subsidies working.  
**[0:50:15-0:50:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:50:15):**  But you know, I think it all comes down to how we manage the human financial and natural  
**[0:50:21-0:50:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:50:21):**  capital aspects of our business.  
**[0:50:24-0:50:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:50:24):**  Here in Australia, the farmers that I saw that were managing and just existing year  
**[0:50:28-0:50:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:50:28):**  to year based on like government assistance, whether that be drought assistance or, you  
**[0:50:34-0:50:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:50:34):**  know, income support, etc.  
**[0:50:36-0:50:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:50:36):**  They were always the most vulnerable when things happen, you know, they and it was very  
**[0:50:41-0:50:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:50:41):**  hard to shift from out, like a lot of the programs were geared at building resilience,  
**[0:50:46-0:50:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:50:46):**  but it was still, it's a mindset shift that's most needed to get out of that.  
**[0:50:51-0:50:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:50:51):**  The most viable businesses I've worked with here in Australia ever have not been subsidised.  
**[0:50:56-0:51:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:50:56):**  They have managed their financial, human and natural capital well.  
**[0:51:00-0:51:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:51:00):**  So that's my context here.  
**[0:51:02-0:51:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:51:02):**  And again, it's very different to other countries by, like I said, our subsidies, we still,  
**[0:51:08-0:51:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:51:08):**  there's still subsidies there.  
**[0:51:09-0:51:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:51:09):**  They probably just operate very differently.  
**[0:51:11-0:51:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:51:11):**  They're just hidden in other financial pools.  
**[0:51:15-0:51:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:51:15):**  They're different, I think.  
**[0:51:18-0:51:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:51:18):**  Like we don't get, receive them in the same forms and the same way, but they're still,  
**[0:51:25-0:51:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:51:25):**  there is still support for farmers.  
**[0:51:27-0:51:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:51:27):**  So, but yeah, here, the most viable businesses do not gear their decisions around subsidies.  
**[0:51:34-0:51:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:51:34):**  Like they don't do it and they are the most profitable and most viable and most resilient.  
**[0:51:40-0:51:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:51:40):**  So that's probably the only context I can really comment on.  
**[0:51:44-0:51:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:51:44):**  Yeah.  
**[0:51:45-0:51:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:51:45):**  Yeah, that makes sense.  
**[0:51:46-0:51:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:51:46):**  With all of the different farm operations that you have seen, what have been, and I'm  
**[0:51:52-0:51:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:51:52):**  sure this is very context dependent and there have been differences all along the people  
**[0:51:58-0:52:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:51:58):**  that you've worked with, but are there any patterns in some of the key decisions that  
**[0:52:02-0:52:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:52:02):**  growers have made to turn around the financial trajectory of their business?  
**[0:52:07-0:52:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:52:07):**  I know you talked a lot in the beginning about starting to manage their natural capital better.  
**[0:52:12-0:52:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:52:12):**  Is that common throughout most of the enterprises you've worked with or are there other commonalities  
**[0:52:17-0:52:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:52:17):**  that have helped to improve the profitability of their businesses?  
**[0:52:21-0:52:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:52:21):**  Yeah, I think it is, the commonalities would be that they start to focus on, like I see  
**[0:52:29-0:52:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:52:29):**  that the financial, human and natural capital is within our circle of influence, the things  
**[0:52:34-0:52:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:52:34):**  we, because we can control how we manage all of those things.  
**[0:52:36-0:52:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:52:36):**  We can't control the weather, we can't control the government policies or the global instability,  
**[0:52:42-0:52:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:52:42):**  but we can work within our circle of influence.  
**[0:52:45-0:52:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:52:45):**  So they always work there and they start to look within, not without.  
**[0:52:50-0:52:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:52:50):**  They stop looking outside to blame their problems on government's climate markets, stuff like  
**[0:52:57-0:52:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:52:57):**  can't control.  
**[0:52:58-0:53:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:52:58):**  They start to take ownership of what they can control and whether that's a human issue,  
**[0:53:04-0:53:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:53:04):**  whether that's a natural capital issue, whether that's financial, it starts there.  
**[0:53:09-0:53:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:53:09):**  And every business will have its weak link, but it's really whatever people do to make  
**[0:53:16-0:53:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:53:16):**  a difference to start focusing within the business, not outside of it.  
**[0:53:20-0:53:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:53:20):**  And often that involves reducing reliance on just the high input treadmill type of farming,  
**[0:53:27-0:53:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:53:27):**  in all its guises.  
**[0:53:28-0:53:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:53:28):**  I've seen people survive in those systems, but I don't see them thriving.  
**[0:53:33-0:53:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:53:33):**  The people I see thriving have really taken steps to get their management right, because  
**[0:53:39-0:53:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:53:39):**  the inputs don't change anything.  
**[0:53:41-0:53:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:53:41):**  It's always the foundation of management and mindset that changes everything in the system.  
**[0:53:46-0:53:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:53:46):**  There's no silver bullet, there's no magic product.  
**[0:53:50-0:53:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:53:50):**  It all comes down to the management and the people, that management aspect, grazing management  
**[0:53:56-0:53:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:53:56):**  is huge.  
**[0:53:57-0:54:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:53:57):**  It's been the one, a lot of people come to me to talk about soil health and I'm quite  
**[0:54:02-0:54:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:54:02):**  surprised that I'm advocating grazing management, not fertilizers.  
**[0:54:05-0:54:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:54:05):**  But it's like, well, if you want to become more profitable, that's the foundation of  
**[0:54:09-0:54:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:54:09):**  that is your management.  
**[0:54:10-0:54:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:54:10):**  It's not the inputs.  
**[0:54:11-0:54:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:54:11):**  So, you know, I think it's coming back to what's within the business, not looking outside  
**[0:54:16-0:54:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:54:16):**  for the answer or the input or the, you know, the thing that someone else will do.  
**[0:54:23-0:54:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:54:23):**  It's coming back to what's here, what's in my land, what's here for me as a manager to  
**[0:54:27-0:54:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:54:27):**  look at.  
**[0:54:29-0:54:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:54:29):**  Yeah, it all starts within the business.  
**[0:54:31-0:54:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:54:31):**  Sure, sure.  
**[0:54:34-0:54:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:54:34):**  And I guess to start to wrap things up here, if someone is coming to you from a desperate  
**[0:54:40-0:54:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:54:40):**  position, their farm business is just bleeding money, they can't see a way out of it.  
**[0:54:45-0:54:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:54:45):**  Where do you tell them to take stock first and start to get informed about what's going  
**[0:54:49-0:54:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:54:49):**  on internally so that they can assess the core problems that need to be fixed and start  
**[0:54:54-0:54:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:54:54):**  on a new trajectory?  
**[0:54:57-0:55:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:54:57):**  Yeah, that's that was my day to day existence for 12 years, we're dealing with that regularly.  
**[0:55:04-0:55:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:55:04):**  And again, I've said this before, I go, the first thing I do if a farmer comes in in crisis  
**[0:55:09-0:55:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:55:09):**  is I sit down and write down what they what their assets are, what their debts are.  
**[0:55:14-0:55:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:55:14):**  So I could really see because some people could be in a crisis and it's actually not  
**[0:55:18-0:55:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:55:18):**  too bad.  
**[0:55:20-0:55:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:55:20):**  And some people could be in a crisis and it's way beyond bad, like, so I'd be like, okay,  
**[0:55:25-0:55:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:55:25):**  what have we got?  
**[0:55:26-0:55:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:55:26):**  What are you own?  
**[0:55:27-0:55:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:55:27):**  And what do you owe?  
**[0:55:28-0:55:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:55:28):**  What are your bank debts?  
**[0:55:29-0:55:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:55:29):**  And sometimes I would deal with, with the farmers who the bank was actually foreclosing  
**[0:55:33-0:55:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:55:33):**  on, that was something I would work with.  
**[0:55:35-0:55:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:55:35):**  And often they would believe they weren't in default when they were so that financial  
**[0:55:39-0:55:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:55:39):**  literacy stuff would come in.  
**[0:55:40-0:55:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:55:40):**  So often it's just getting people to understand the reality of where they're sitting.  
**[0:55:44-0:55:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:55:44):**  And that's the first step, drawing up a balance sheet to see where you are as far as what  
**[0:55:51-0:55:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:55:51):**  you own and what you owe.  
**[0:55:53-0:55:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:55:53):**  Number one with anyone in crisis, and then to support them through that.  
**[0:55:58-0:56:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:55:58):**  The second thing was then to look at their financials to see their profit and loss.  
**[0:56:03-0:56:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:56:03):**  And, you know, that gives you because usually at that point, they haven't been budgeting,  
**[0:56:07-0:56:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:56:07):**  and they haven't got budgets.  
**[0:56:08-0:56:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:56:08):**  Some people will bring budgets in, they've been doing that and been trying to manage  
**[0:56:12-0:56:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:56:12):**  it by themselves.  
**[0:56:13-0:56:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:56:13):**  But it's very rare when someone's under that stress, those things become very hard when  
**[0:56:18-0:56:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:56:18):**  you're stressed, you know, and sometimes I've noticed people, I know they were stressed  
**[0:56:22-0:56:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:56:22):**  because someone who was really good at that stuff would suddenly stop doing it.  
**[0:56:25-0:56:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:56:25):**  And it would be okay.  
**[0:56:27-0:56:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:56:27):**  They're not coping.  
**[0:56:28-0:56:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:56:28):**  So, you know, often it is to assess that have they got any financial figures I can look  
**[0:56:32-0:56:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:56:32):**  at to see what's going on.  
**[0:56:35-0:56:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:56:35):**  It gives you a really good, good, good insight.  
**[0:56:38-0:56:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:56:38):**  But then for that farmer, if they're working through this on their own, they should seek  
**[0:56:42-0:56:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:56:42):**  support from somewhere, you know, find someone to support you through this.  
**[0:56:47-0:56:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:56:47):**  And then it would be looking at the cash flow to see if there was any hope of changing anything.  
**[0:56:53-0:56:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:56:53):**  And if not, what are the options of, you know, how do you then change the situation?  
**[0:56:57-0:56:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:56:57):**  Can you improve cash flow?  
**[0:56:59-0:57:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:56:59):**  Can you reduce debt?  
**[0:57:01-0:57:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:57:01):**  Can you you know, where are the options for changing this to make it workable?  
**[0:57:04-0:57:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:57:04):**  And they come out of those two aspects like, you know, getting that basic financial literacy.  
**[0:57:10-0:57:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:57:10):**  And if the things I've been talking about today, if you don't understand what a balance  
**[0:57:14-0:57:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:57:14):**  sheet is, or cash flow, and it's got you freaking out, it's a really good sign to stop putting  
**[0:57:20-0:57:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:57:20):**  your head in the sand and actually go and find some way you can learn it.  
**[0:57:23-0:57:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:57:23):**  Because once you learn it, you realise you're worried about nothing.  
**[0:57:27-0:57:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:57:27):**  It's actually quite easy maths.  
**[0:57:28-0:57:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:57:28):**  There's a lot of good tools you can use, like easy to make.

**[0:57:37-0:57:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:57:37):**  people.  
**[0:57:38-0:57:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:57:38):**  But you know, you can easily start to manage it.  
**[0:57:41-0:57:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:57:41):**  The thing is that yeah, and sometimes if it is hard, we ignore it until we have no choice  
**[0:57:46-0:57:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:57:46):**  but to look at it, and it gets worse and worse and worse till we have no choice.  
**[0:57:50-0:57:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:57:50):**  So if these things have got you kind of going, oh, I should do it, but it's scary or it's,  
**[0:57:55-0:57:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:57:55):**  you know, I don't want to know, I want to know that I want to know.

**[0:58:06-0:58:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:58:06):**  Start monitoring before it really does become out of control.  
**[0:58:08-0:58:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:58:08):**  If it's something that you don't feel like you have a grasp on, definitely go and do  
**[0:58:12-0:58:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:58:12):**  the detective work, crunch the numbers and see where you are before you have to go to  
**[0:58:17-0:58:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:58:17):**  a professional and they tell you, okay, well, you have a few options left, right?  
**[0:58:22-0:58:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:58:22):**  Yeah, and I also, I've always been pretty good at this stuff.  
**[0:58:26-0:58:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:58:26):**  And I remember, you know, using a rural financial counsellor, like I said, they're here in Australia,  
**[0:58:31-0:58:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:58:31):**  we're pretty lucky to have them.  
**[0:58:32-0:58:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:58:32):**  And I was finding, I had all the figures done, but I just needed another head to bounce it  
**[0:58:37-0:58:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:58:37):**  off, like to get the perspective too.  
**[0:58:40-0:58:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:58:40):**  So even if you're really good at these skills, sometimes we, you know, we all need to have  
**[0:58:45-0:58:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:58:45):**  someone we can ask, can you have a look at this?  
**[0:58:47-0:58:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:58:47):**  If I miss something, does it look like I'm on the right track?  
**[0:58:50-0:58:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:58:50):**  You know, just, it really does help us to have sounding boards with financial information.  
**[0:58:56-0:59:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:58:56):**  And that may be your accountant, it may be an advisor, maybe a consultant or business  
**[0:59:01-0:59:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:59:01):**  coach, but finding somebody that you can use to just to bounce it off, because sometimes  
**[0:59:07-0:59:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:59:07):**  we're so in the thick of it, we need that perspective from someone outside of it.  
**[0:59:13-0:59:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:59:13):**  That's a very good point.  
**[0:59:14-0:59:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:59:14):**  Yeah.  
**[0:59:15-0:59:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:59:15):**  And I think it's also worth a lot of people hearing this who aren't managing farms, like  
**[0:59:19-0:59:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:59:19):**  so many points of advice that you've been giving here are very universally applied.  
**[0:59:24-0:59:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:59:24):**  And I've been making a lot of strides and getting my own finances more under control,  
**[0:59:29-0:59:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:59:29):**  especially as my partner and I are going into some of the biggest investments of our life,  
**[0:59:33-0:59:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:59:33):**  we're getting a property, we're starting to build new businesses.  
**[0:59:36-0:59:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:59:36):**  And fortunately, she is very, very detail oriented.  
**[0:59:39-0:59:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:59:39):**  And she focuses on so many of the small calculations that I'm not used to looking after myself.  
**[0:59:44-0:59:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:59:44):**  But I have been, you know, I've helped to manage farms in the past, I've helped to consult  
**[0:59:49-0:59:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:59:49):**  people through the design of their farms.  
**[0:59:51-0:59:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:59:51):**  But this has been a piece that has been weak in my experience in the past and seeing just  
**[0:59:58-1:00:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=0:59:58):**  how much you can analyze and start to monitor when these calculations and yeah, these numbers  
**[1:00:06-1:00:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:00:06):**  are in place has been really empowering for me.  
**[1:00:08-1:00:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:00:08):**  And I've been helping to translate that into the other work that I do.  
**[1:00:12-1:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:00:12):**  And so, I mean, I would really hope that a broad range of people listen to this beyond  
**[1:00:18-1:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:00:18):**  farmers because whether you're starting a small business, or you're just getting your  
**[1:00:22-1:00:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:00:22):**  personal finances under control in order to try and make some projections of where you  
**[1:00:26-1:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:00:26):**  want to go in your life, all of this applies.  
**[1:00:29-1:00:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:00:29):**  Yeah, and it's the secret to us doing what we're here to do successfully.  
**[1:00:35-1:00:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:00:35):**  Like you know, is nothing worse than saying someone who's got these amazing skills to

**[1:00:45-1:00:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:00:45):**  like, you know, like, it's the skill that sits underneath in the foundation of business,  
**[1:00:51-1:00:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:00:51):**  you know, if we want to be in business, whatever our business, we have to be able to manage  
**[1:00:55-1:00:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:00:55):**  our finances.  
**[1:00:57-1:01:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:00:57):**  And that's every business isn't it, you know, it's the foundation of all of our success.  
**[1:01:02-1:01:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:01:02):**  And I guess, you know, I guess, you know, exploring our own mindset around money, and  
**[1:01:08-1:01:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:01:08):**  always questioning into that money mindset works probably something that fascinates me,  
**[1:01:13-1:01:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:01:13):**  because I've had the privilege of working with a range of people on that level, and  
**[1:01:17-1:01:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:01:17):**  watching how that manifests in their world.  
**[1:01:21-1:01:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:01:21):**  Like, it fascinates me no end, and it's encouraged me to work on my own mindset around money.  
**[1:01:27-1:01:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:01:27):**  And, you know, just keep questioning into it and keep expanding that, because you never  
**[1:01:32-1:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:01:32):**  arrive where you've got it all sorted.  
**[1:01:34-1:01:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:01:34):**  But you keep growing and expanding and learning and removing those inner barriers that, you  
**[1:01:40-1:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:01:40):**  know, we set up by not managing these things.  
**[1:01:42-1:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:01:42):**  Sometimes we hit an upper limit.  
**[1:01:44-1:01:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:01:44):**  And you know, we start to not manage things so well, because we, but how can it be better  
**[1:01:49-1:01:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:01:49):**  than that, you know, allowing ourselves to actually receive money for what we do?  
**[1:01:54-1:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:01:54):**  Whether we're farmers or any in any business, that's a huge, huge issue for everybody, I  
**[1:02:00-1:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:02:00):**  think is, yeah, the receiving of not just giving.  
**[1:02:04-1:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:02:04):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[1:02:05-1:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:02:05):**  I know that's something that I still struggle with when it comes to actually valuing things  
**[1:02:10-1:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:02:10):**  in terms of money, your own skill set, your time.  
**[1:02:12-1:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:02:12):**  It's, you know, people are notoriously bad at that.  
**[1:02:16-1:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:02:16):**  And there are so many mindset hang ups beyond just where you see the projections going,  
**[1:02:22-1:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:02:22):**  but also how you value things that you have to offer.  
**[1:02:25-1:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:02:25):**  There's so many places we can go even deeper into this.  
**[1:02:30-1:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:02:30):**  And being really mindful of our wording around things like, you know, if we're coming from  
**[1:02:35-1:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:02:35):**  a scarcity mindset, we'll see costs, costs, costs, costs.  
**[1:02:38-1:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:02:38):**  But when we're in an abundance mindset, which is the opposite of scarcity, it's an investment.  
**[1:02:44-1:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:02:44):**  So is this an investment in my business?  
**[1:02:47-1:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:02:47):**  You know, we see the value we provide.  
**[1:02:49-1:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:02:49):**  As a farmer, there's value in providing healthy food for people grown in systems that are  
**[1:02:56-1:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:02:56):**  regenerating natural resources.  
**[1:02:57-1:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:02:57):**  There's a huge value in that that goes way beyond money.  
**[1:03:01-1:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:03:01):**  But you know, starting to value what we do, rather than seeing it as just an exchange  
**[1:03:05-1:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:03:05):**  of time.  
**[1:03:06-1:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:03:06):**  There's this immense value.  
**[1:03:08-1:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:03:08):**  And all of those things flow through this whole discussion, don't they?  
**[1:03:15-1:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:03:15):**  Yeah.  
**[1:03:16-1:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:03:16):**  Well, so in thinking of next steps, how can people reach out to you, Kim, and learn more

**[1:03:24-1:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:03:24):**  If there are any educational offerings as well?  
**[1:03:28-1:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:03:28):**  Yeah.

**[1:03:40-1:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:03:40):**  I've got lots of blogs actually around money, financial transitions to regenerative ag.  
**[1:03:46-1:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:03:46):**  The latest one I wrote was actually on scarcity.  
**[1:03:49-1:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:03:49):**  But it was almost like, you know, talking about enough is a decision, not an amount,  
**[1:03:53-1:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:03:53):**  and how that relates in our farming systems.  
**[1:03:55-1:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:03:55):**  Like, where is enough, where is enough land, where is enough, you know, production and  
**[1:04:00-1:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:04:00):**  where we come back to that.  
**[1:04:01-1:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:04:01):**  It's often a decision.  
**[1:04:03-1:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:04:03):**  But exploring scarcity in terms of regeneration and how we can flip our thinking.  
**[1:04:08-1:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/kim-deans-on-the-power-of-financial-planning-to-transform-your-farm/#t=1:04:08):**  So there's some really good mindset hacks in a few of my blogs.

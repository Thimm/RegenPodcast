**[0:00:00-0:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:00:13):**  Here we dive deep into the diverse worlds of regenerative living, permaculture, and  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:00:17):**  natural building as we aspire to help you reach your highest potential for yourself,  
**[0:00:22-0:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:00:22):**  for your community, and for this beautiful planet that we share.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:00:25):**  As always, I'm your host Oliver Gaucher, and I'm thrilled to guide you through this week's  
**[0:00:29-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:00:29):**  episode, so let's jump right in.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:00:59):**  Alright, in this session I had the pleasure of catching up again with Neil Spackman, one  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:01:12):**  of the primary designers and organizers of the Al-Beda project in Saudi Arabia.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:01:17):**  The Al-Beda project began in 2009 with a long list of Lathi ambitions, and among them they  
**[0:01:23-0:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:01:23):**  aimed to improve the local economy, act as a model for sustainable development in the  
**[0:01:30-0:01:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:01:30):**  Arabian Peninsula, reduce dependence on government handouts for the community, and store and  
**[0:01:33-0:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:01:33):**  harvest rainwater in the landscape through the restoration of the savannah ecosystem  
**[0:01:38-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:01:38):**  which had been desertified in only a few decades.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:01:42):**  This is the second interview I've done with Neil on his work in Saudi Arabia, and this  
**[0:01:45-0:01:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:01:45):**  time around we went in even greater depth on the details and context of the project  
**[0:01:50-0:01:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:01:50):**  that informed the design and decision making process.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:01:53):**  Now if you're interested in dryland and desert regeneration, I highly recommend taking the  
**[0:01:57-0:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:01:57):**  time to listen to the first episode, even though this one stands well on its own.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:02:02):**  In this interview, we revisit the history of the region and how the government policies  
**[0:02:06-0:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:02:06):**  had major impacts on the lives of the nomadic Bedouin people and in turn their relationship  
**[0:02:10-0:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:02:10):**  with the ecology of Al-Beda.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:02:13):**  Neil walks me through the planning and design process that preceded the work, and how the  
**[0:02:17-0:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:02:17):**  cultural context of the project played a big role in setting the goals for a more sustainable  
**[0:02:21-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:02:21):**  economy for the area.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:02:24):**  We also dig into the biggest takeaways from 10 years of the largest desert regeneration  
**[0:02:28-0:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:02:28):**  attempt yet made in Saudi Arabia.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:02:31):**  From there, Neil even talks about his new projects, and how his return to academia has  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:02:36):**  informed a new approach to degraded land restoration as well as how farming can be leveraged as  
**[0:02:41-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:02:41):**  an ecological asset.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:02:43):**  Neil makes a lot of great recommendations towards the end for resources including books  
**[0:02:47-0:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:02:47):**  and videos that help to inspire and inform him of these ambitious projects.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:02:52):**  So be sure to check out the resources section under this episode on the website.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:02:56):**  We cover a lot of ground in this session, so I'll turn things over now to Neil.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:03:00):**  Hey Neil, it's so great to be talking to you again.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:03:03):**  Thanks for making time to be back on the show.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:03:05):**  Hey, thanks for having me again.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:03:07):**  Hey, it's my pleasure.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:03:08):**  Now it's been a little while since we chatted in person like this, though I've been following  
**[0:03:12-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:03:12):**  your progress on social media and all of the great resources you've been publishing for  
**[0:03:16-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:03:16):**  a while.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:03:17):**  But what do you say we just jump into the interview so we can catch up on all the new  
**[0:03:21-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:03:21):**  projects you've been up to?  
**[0:03:23-0:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:03:23):**  Sounds good.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:03:24):**  All right, so just quickly for those interested in hearing about your background and further  
**[0:03:29-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:03:29):**  information about the Albeda project, which we'll talk about in a second, I'll let them  
**[0:03:33-0:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:03:33):**  refer back to our original interview at the Abundant Edge website, and I'll put the links  
**[0:03:37-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:03:37):**  in the show notes for this episode so that they can go right to the start.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:03:43):**  But with that out of the way, why don't we start by getting a little update on the Albeda  
**[0:03:47-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:03:47):**  project?  
**[0:03:48-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:03:48):**  What were some of the original goals of that project that you were able to reach in the  
**[0:03:53-0:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:03:53):**  years that you were out there?  
**[0:03:55-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:03:55):**  We were able to reach.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:03:58):**  We did successfully build a template for, well yeah, the short version is we've successfully  
**[0:04:08-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:04:08):**  got a template for the, to restore ecological function and build a new regenerative economy  
**[0:04:20-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:04:20):**  in that area of Saudi Arabia.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:04:22):**  Now that's a pretty broad outlook there.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:04:26):**  Can you talk about some of the specifics and how, from where it started to where it is  
**[0:04:31-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:04:31):**  now, the steps facilitated a change to something that made a tangible impact for the community  
**[0:04:38-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:04:38):**  there?  
**[0:04:39-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:04:39):**  Yeah, I mean it was, the specifics of that are, we have this region that's about 700  
**[0:04:51-0:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:04:51):**  square kilometers, but it's also a fractal of the much larger region.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:04:59):**  I mean the whole west coast of the Arabian Peninsula follows the same geographic pattern  
**[0:05:05-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:05:05):**  and it's all a fractal.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:05:08):**  And so what we worked on was a very small watershed.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:05:12):**  You know, we've got a mountain summit, we've got valleys that flood and we've got a flood  
**[0:05:17-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:05:17):**  plain and that site was about 100 acres.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:05:23):**  And so on that site I designed and worked with local folks to build essentially a template  
**[0:05:32-0:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:05:32):**  for the reforestation of this region.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:05:36):**  And forestry might be too strong a word, it's closer to a dryland savanna than it is a forest,  
**[0:05:45-0:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:05:45):**  but we have successfully done that where we're harvesting floods out of the mountains, getting  
**[0:05:52-0:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:05:52):**  that water into the ground instead of letting it run off into the sea, and then using a  
**[0:05:59-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:05:59):**  portion of that water going into the ground to reestablish vegetation which involves both  
**[0:06:07-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:06:07):**  you know grasses for grazing as well as appropriate tree crops and native trees that are you know  
**[0:06:18-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:06:18):**  regrowing.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:06:21):**  It might be useful to talk to bring up that this is after 60 years of desertification  
**[0:06:30-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:06:30):**  which was largely driven by policy changes and the elimination of a traditional management  
**[0:06:35-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:06:35):**  system for that land.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:06:37):**  Sure, yeah, this can be brought back way further because the Arabian Peninsula, I mean if you  
**[0:06:44-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:06:44):**  go back to when people first inhabited that area it was much more lush and part of the  
**[0:06:48-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:06:48):**  area that was considered the Fertile Crescent, no?  
**[0:06:51-0:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:06:51):**  Well the Fertile Crescent's up north, but yeah during, I mean when there were rivers  
**[0:06:59-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:06:59):**  in the Arabian Peninsula it was during the last ice age is my understanding, and the  
**[0:07:06-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:07:06):**  drying up of that is you know it's debated how much of that was driven by people and  
**[0:07:15-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:07:15):**  how much of it was driven by you know larger climatic patterns that people can't really  
**[0:07:23-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:07:23):**  affect, but there's no question that what we don't see in the Arabian Peninsula that  
**[0:07:33-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:07:33):**  we do see in the Fertile Crescent is salinization driven by irrigation.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:07:41):**  For instance, in modern day Iraq you know they irrigated for hundreds and hundreds of  
**[0:07:47-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:07:47):**  years back in the you know Assyrian and Babylonian times, and when their land could no longer  
**[0:07:54-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:07:54):**  produce crops because of the salinization caused by the irrigation, that led to a diaspora,  
**[0:08:02-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:08:02):**  that's where the Phoenicians came from.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:08:04):**  Phoenicians were Babylonians who went to Lebanon, quickly deforested those mountains using the  
**[0:08:14-0:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:08:14):**  same agricultural techniques they had used you know on the Euphrates, and then after  
**[0:08:20-0:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:08:20):**  they had you know eliminated most of the soil there they had to become traders along the  
**[0:08:25-0:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:08:25):**  Mediterranean because they didn't have any other option.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:08:30):**  In the Arabian Peninsula you don't have that farming effect, at least in the parts where  
**[0:08:39-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:08:39):**  I've been in Mecca and north of there or east of there, there's not a strong history of  
**[0:08:45-0:08:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:08:45):**  farming.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:08:46):**  If you go south towards Yemen then there absolutely is.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:08:49):**  But there was a pattern called or a management system called the Hima.  
**[0:08:55-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:08:55):**  The Hima was used throughout the Arabian Peninsula and it was a management system that predates  
**[0:09:00-0:09:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:09:00):**  Islam.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:09:02):**  So at least a couple thousand years old and potentially older than that, and this was  
**[0:09:08-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:09:08):**  a tribal management system where they maintained the fertility of the land by strict management  
**[0:09:14-0:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:09:14):**  of who could graze where and when, whose animals got which part of the tribal land, etc. etc.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:09:22):**  And that system was eliminated in the 1950s, not just in Saudi Arabia but in Syria, in  
**[0:09:28-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:09:28):**  the eastern Gulf, as a drive to build you know a nation state instead of just having  
**[0:09:36-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:09:36):**  tribes everywhere.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:09:39):**  And that was really the catalyst for wide scale deforestation and desertification because  
**[0:09:46-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:09:46):**  once the management system collapsed then it was just a free for all on grazing and  
**[0:09:54-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:09:54):**  cutting down wood.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:09:56):**  And as the people were unable to feed their animals due to you know mismanaged grazing,  
**[0:10:04-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:10:04):**  then they had to buy imported feed and they got cash for buying imported feed by selling  
**[0:10:10-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:10:10):**  wood.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:10:12):**  So there's been this downward spiral driven by a mix of policy changes and people responding  
**[0:10:19-0:10:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:10:19):**  to the incentives that those policies created.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:10:24):**  And then you get this you know direct link between rural poverty and ecological degradation  
**[0:10:30-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:10:30):**  that is a global pattern that we see very very starkly in a place as dry and hot as  
**[0:10:40-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:10:40):**  Mecca.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:10:41):**  And so with the context of those changes for the societies that traditionally inhabited  
**[0:10:47-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:10:47):**  that land and the massive ecological changes that accompany it, what were some of the first  
**[0:10:53-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:10:53):**  strategies that you recommended for the project to follow to start to reverse the impact that  
**[0:10:59-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:10:59):**  it had done over the last 70 years?  
**[0:11:02-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:11:02):**  Well the most fundamental had to do with water.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:11:06):**  Like you always start with your limiting resource right?  
**[0:11:10-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:11:10):**  Then some places that sunlight where we are it's water and so it was how do we get things  
**[0:11:20-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:11:20):**  to grow that we can eat or sell without depleting the aquifers?  
**[0:11:29-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:11:29):**  And Saudi Arabia has depleted the bulk of its aquifers over the last generation.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:11:38):**  In the 70s and 80s they had a policy to be food independent and so they were growing  
**[0:11:44-0:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:11:44):**  wheat with fossil water at around a cost of $1000 per bushel when on the global market  
**[0:11:54-0:11:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:11:54):**  it was $300 per bushel.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:11:59):**  And they consumed 4000 or 400 cubic kilometers of water in a matter of decades.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:12:09):**  And that's a huge amount of water.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:12:11):**  It's hard to fathom how much that is but it's essentially Lake Erie.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:12:17):**  Like if Lake Erie just disappeared that's how much water they used up in the 70s 80s  
**[0:12:25-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:12:25):**  and 90s.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:12:26):**  And they figured out that they were essentially exporting water and that's the virtual water  
**[0:12:34-0:12:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:12:34):**  concept and so for us it was how do we create a system that restores aquifers while making  
**[0:12:43-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:12:43):**  the land more lush?  
**[0:12:45-0:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:12:45):**  Using the water resources to its maximum and seeing how many ways that it can be used before  
**[0:12:51-0:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:12:51):**  it leaves the site essentially.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:12:53):**  Yeah or that's essentially it.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:12:58):**  But the goal was increase water resources in the desert while also increasing the carrying  
**[0:13:06-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:13:06):**  capacity of the land to support life.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:13:10):**  And those things on initial thought seemed contradictory because if you're using up water  
**[0:13:17-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:13:17):**  to grow things then you should have less water and we actually didn't do that.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:13:24):**  We have more water and more life.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:13:27):**  So let's talk a little bit about how that can be manufactured or designed for when they  
**[0:13:35-0:13:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:13:35):**  seemingly contradict each other especially in the space where you know water evaporates  
**[0:13:40-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:13:40):**  off and is used up so quickly or you know leaves the site very very quickly.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:13:44):**  Yeah well and that was the key was understanding the water cycle and figuring out where you  
**[0:13:51-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:13:51):**  know waste was happening let's say.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:13:56):**  For us on the west coast of the Arabian Peninsula you have these massive floods where 80% of  
**[0:14:04-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:14:04):**  that water runs into the Red Sea.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:14:07):**  80, 90% and it's the only sustainable source of water in the region because I mean it runs  
**[0:14:16-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:14:16):**  into the sea and then we're desalinating water from the sea you know to serve the cities  
**[0:14:27-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:14:27):**  and industry as well.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:14:29):**  Sure at a much much higher cost than it would be probably to capture the water at a freshwater  
**[0:14:35-0:14:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:14:35):**  state.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:14:36):**  Exactly.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:14:37):**  So that was I mean it just it seems so simple but essentially we looked at the floods and  
**[0:14:45-0:14:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:14:45):**  said okay these are not these may be a destructive disaster that we need to be afraid of because  
**[0:14:54-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:14:54):**  they're dangerous but it's also the only source of water that we should be using because if  
**[0:15:02-0:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:15:02):**  we I mean that water is what recharges the shallow wells and the shallow aquifers at  
**[0:15:10-0:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:15:10):**  a lesser and lesser rate as deforestation and desertification increases and so it was  
**[0:15:16-0:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:15:16):**  let's let's harvest these floods and instead of letting them run off into the sea or run  
**[0:15:22-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:15:22):**  off of our site let's get that water in the ground recharge the groundwater and then use  
**[0:15:29-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:15:29):**  that to get an ecology going again and so on on this hundred acre site that we had which  
**[0:15:36-0:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:15:36):**  is about you know 70 60 70 percent of it is mountains and you know a third or so is the  
**[0:15:45-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:15:45):**  flood plain so it's at least a two to one ratio of runoff to catchment but we used up  
**[0:15:52-0:16:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:15:52):**  20,000 cubic meters in irrigation to get our savanna system going and we caught you know  
**[0:16:02-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:16:02):**  between 50,000 cubic meters in that same period so we we've got at least two times more water  
**[0:16:10-0:16:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:16:10):**  going into the ground than we're taking out and now that we're not irrigating anymore  
**[0:16:16-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:16:16):**  we cut the irrigation in 2016 now it's just there's a greater percentage of that water  
**[0:16:23-0:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:16:23):**  of that rainfall that is effective instead of running off and evaporating or or hitting  
**[0:16:29-0:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:16:29):**  the sea.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:16:31):**  So let's start from the beginning here and talk a little bit about how you came to these  
**[0:16:36-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:16:36):**  design decisions that you felt would be correct to the context in which you were working because  
**[0:16:42-0:16:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:16:42):**  that's kind of everything how did you sort of start to research the plans that would  
**[0:16:47-0:16:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:16:47):**  be appropriate that you thought had the best chance of survival while still respecting  
**[0:16:53-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:16:53):**  sort of native species and what was available I don't know how budget factored into those  
**[0:16:59-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:16:59):**  plans give me an idea about how you arrived at some of these strategies that you implemented  
**[0:17:05-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:17:05):**  from the beginning because nothing like this had really been done or intended before in  
**[0:17:09-0:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:17:09):**  this area what were some of your references that you look to to kind of inform the decision  
**[0:17:15-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:17:15):**  making process.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:17:17):**  So there's there are some great sources academically for desert work one is called the challenge  
**[0:17:25-0:17:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:17:25):**  of the desert and it's about restoring traditional farming methods in the Negev there was a lot  
**[0:17:34-0:17:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:17:34):**  of relevant material there that I learned from I did have a two week period with Jeff  
**[0:17:40-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:17:40):**  Lawton where he and I essentially were one on one and hashing over different design ideas  
**[0:17:49-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:17:49):**  and different aspects of different things he actually helped me pick the demonstration  
**[0:17:54-0:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:17:54):**  site because he had a better idea of what to look for than I did at that point but the  
**[0:18:04-0:18:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:18:04):**  design decisions with respect to the water are way different than with respect to you  
**[0:18:08-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:18:08):**  know the species we were using for the species we were using I did something called a climate  
**[0:18:15-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:18:15):**  analog where you you know and I've got there's a great resource on how to build a climate  
**[0:18:25-0:18:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:18:25):**  analog from that Andrew Millison did at the University of Oregon that actually cites me  
**[0:18:32-0:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:18:32):**  quite a bit but essentially you you look at your latitude your climate your elevation  
**[0:18:40-0:18:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:18:40):**  your distance to the nearest large body of water you know your precipitation rates your  
**[0:18:46-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:18:46):**  your diurnal temperature swings all these different factors and then you can fly around  
**[0:18:53-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:18:53):**  the world on Google Earth and find very very similar locations that have the same kind  
**[0:19:00-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:19:00):**  of conditions that you are working in and you can identify those places and then do  
**[0:19:06-0:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:19:06):**  some research on what did how did the indigenous people in those places live what were their  
**[0:19:13-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:19:13):**  buildings like what were their food systems like were they gardeners were they nomads  
**[0:19:21-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:19:21):**  were they camel people were they sheep people were they you know cattle people and you and  
**[0:19:27-0:19:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:19:27):**  you look at these indigenous systems around the world that match your climatic conditions  
**[0:19:34-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:19:34):**  and then you can you can take bits and pieces of those that are you know appropriate for  
**[0:19:41-0:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:19:41):**  where you are you know both the climatic context the geographical context the and the cultural  
**[0:19:47-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:19:47):**  and the people context as well and though that's what essentially gave me you know a  
**[0:19:53-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:19:53):**  list of species to to trial and we trialed 15 different species on the Albedo demonstration  
**[0:20:05-0:20:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:20:05):**  site and after we cut the irrigation in 2016 it was kind of a let's wait and see what survives  
**[0:20:14-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:20:14):**  the best what produces the best and what isn't going to make it and so out of those 15 species  
**[0:20:22-0:20:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:20:22):**  we ended up with four that you know can handle the climate function as an ecology that aren't  
**[0:20:31-0:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:20:31):**  going to you know be destructive in any sense but that are also going to produce very useful  
**[0:20:40-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:20:40):**  goods that fit together you know as a cohesive economy and a cohesive ecology and so I know  
**[0:20:51-0:20:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:20:51):**  a big aspect of this design was the cultural context in which you were working to and understanding  
**[0:20:57-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:20:57):**  the lifestyles and the aspirations of the people that were going to be interacting with  
**[0:21:01-0:21:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:21:01):**  this system could you speak on that for a minute yeah absolutely I mean this is arguably  
**[0:21:06-0:21:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:21:06):**  the most important part because if if people don't want to adopt what you're teaching them  
**[0:21:12-0:21:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:21:12):**  then it's it's no good in the first place and so the the folks that I was working with  
**[0:21:18-0:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:21:18):**  there you know they were they had a very nomadic history they know camels and goats and sheep  
**[0:21:26-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:21:26):**  really well they that's where all of their expertise is centered in the management and  
**[0:21:39-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:21:39):**  use of those animals to provide a life and so we knew that grazing had to be because  
**[0:21:47-0:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:21:47):**  of the culture the system had to be aimed at restoring sustainable grazing patterns  
**[0:21:54-0:22:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:21:54):**  while introducing some resilience both ecological and economic to that system and so we started  
**[0:22:03-0:22:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:22:03):**  with the idea that you know in the future people would still be grazing they would still  
**[0:22:10-0:22:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:22:10):**  be producing milk and animal skins and meat and so we look for a way to enhance that and  
**[0:22:20-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:22:20):**  get it to fit into a process of regeneration rather than a process of deforestation yeah  
**[0:22:29-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:22:29):**  I'm starting to learn some of the intricacies and the differences of the cultures and the  
**[0:22:33-0:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:22:33):**  ways of life here in the Arabian Gulf as I'm at the moment in Kuwait and I'm learning a  
**[0:22:39-0:22:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:22:39):**  lot through my sister who studied these much in the same academic form that you did and  
**[0:22:43-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:22:43):**  it's absolutely fascinating the histories of how people lived in I mean certainly in  
**[0:22:49-0:22:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:22:49):**  modern history this has been what is considered very marginal land where a lot of the population  
**[0:22:54-0:22:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:22:54):**  centers have been centered around the coast and around fishing and the nomadic tribes  
**[0:22:59-0:23:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:22:59):**  operating in the interior and how that's affected the ecology of these areas is absolutely fascinating  
**[0:23:04-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:23:04):**  and I'm really trying to understand this more in the short time that I have here now we're  
**[0:23:10-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:23:10):**  not going to focus entirely on albedo throughout this interview but before you kind of wrap  
**[0:23:16-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:23:16):**  up and move on to your other projects can you tell me about some of the biggest takeaways  
**[0:23:20-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:23:20):**  and the learning experiences for you personally since the project began oh goodness well first  
**[0:23:27-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:23:27):**  of all it's possible you had your doubts at the beginning well we didn't know yeah we  
**[0:23:34-0:23:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:23:34):**  didn't know if I mean it's we're in a really really bad area I mean nobody looks at this  
**[0:23:42-0:23:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:23:42):**  region and says that that's good you know agricultural land it's it's not considered  
**[0:23:48-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:23:48):**  arable and the so it is possible and I believe it can even be profitable in the long run  
**[0:24:05-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:24:05):**  and with the right kind of financial structures beyond that I learned a lot about politics  
**[0:24:16-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:24:16):**  to be honest I mean we where we did slow down where we did come into you know bottlenecks  
**[0:24:24-0:24:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:24:24):**  and and actually where the project is bottlenecked now has more to do with politics than anything  
**[0:24:31-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:24:31):**  else and and that's so common actually it's it is yeah from it so I talk to you there  
**[0:24:41-0:24:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:24:41):**  especially things that are involving public pieces and have government bodies of and corporations  
**[0:24:47-0:24:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:24:47):**  interested in that result that's a lot of what I've heard yeah it's it's very very common  
**[0:24:53-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:24:53):**  and so I've had to I've had to learn a lot about maneuvering those and negotiating them  
**[0:25:00-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:25:00):**  and and I haven't learned as much as I could have because once things really got bogged  
**[0:25:06-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:25:06):**  down I I decided I was gonna leave and go back to school and we'll see if see if the  
**[0:25:15-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:25:15):**  politics would work their way out or not hmm I will say that there's been there was a lot  
**[0:25:24-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:25:24):**  I think there was a lot of trepidation among my network that I was moving out with these  
**[0:25:29-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:25:29):**  folks to live with the bedouin albedo and there it took a long time for me to gain the  
**[0:25:37-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:25:37):**  trust of the people but there are bonds there that are never going to be broken and that  
**[0:25:47-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:25:47):**  that cultural and people piece of it like I know we're focused so much on environment  
**[0:25:54-0:26:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:25:54):**  and environmental issues but we cannot solve those without involving the people who are  
**[0:26:03-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:26:03):**  local and who are indigenous and who you know have a long history and a long attachment  
**[0:26:13-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:26:13):**  and deep deep attachment to the land I don't know I don't I don't think most Americans  
**[0:26:19-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:26:19):**  really understand how traditional peoples are attached to the land they're on because  
**[0:26:28-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:26:28):**  we're so mobile and we move around all the time and even though these folks were nomads  
**[0:26:35-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:26:35):**  you know it was it was a specific nomadism to a specific place and that land is a huge  
**[0:26:41-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:26:41):**  piece of their identity and that's not something that we understand on a visceral level as  
**[0:26:51-0:26:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:26:51):**  Americans most of the time but the I mean fundamentally if those folks aren't a part  
**[0:26:57-0:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:26:57):**  of the solution then you don't have a solution you've sort of you've you've accomplished  
**[0:27:02-0:27:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:27:02):**  something that I consider really admirable which is that you at this point you're kind  
**[0:27:06-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:27:06):**  of barely involved and you've turned the project almost over entirely to the people who are  
**[0:27:10-0:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:27:10):**  on the ground working and I'm not sure whoever else is involved at the higher levels of planning  
**[0:27:16-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:27:16):**  an organization is that always your goal or has it simply been a question of reaching  
**[0:27:22-0:27:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:27:22):**  a point where you're not needed for it to continue that was always the goal yeah it  
**[0:27:28-0:27:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:27:28):**  was always the goal to and and it should always be the goal to turn management over to local  
**[0:27:33-0:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:27:33):**  management so right now my involvement is I'm still an advisor on the project the the  
**[0:27:41-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:27:41):**  person who who funded this is named Haifa Al-Faisal she's the youngest daughter of the  
**[0:27:48-0:27:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:27:48):**  late King Faisal and she she was the founder and the funder primarily and she's still very  
**[0:27:56-0:28:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:27:56):**  much involved particularly in the housing infrastructure and charity aspects of the  
**[0:28:03-0:28:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:28:03):**  project so I will say this we Al-Bayda project was named Saudi Arabia's national prototype  
**[0:28:12-0:28:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:28:12):**  for housing development about 18 months ago and and where because we're the first ones  
**[0:28:19-0:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:28:19):**  where where we were like okay we want to do housing but unless there's an economy associated  
**[0:28:26-0:28:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:28:26):**  with the region then there's not going to be any reason for people to live there right  
**[0:28:31-0:28:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:28:31):**  people people will move to the cities as as we have seen you know all over the planet  
**[0:28:38-0:28:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:28:38):**  if there isn't a local economy keeping them there and that approach and some of the successes  
**[0:28:45-0:28:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:28:45):**  we had in you know teaching people how to build teaching people how to reforest teaching  
**[0:28:51-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:28:51):**  people how to harvest water led to our being named the national housing prototype so once  
**[0:28:59-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:28:59):**  once Al-Bayda has reached a certain level of success there are a number of ministries  
**[0:29:05-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:29:05):**  that have said if this works we are going to do it all over the country which is I mean  
**[0:29:13-0:29:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:29:13):**  that's a that's a huge success that is and it the Ministry of Housing is now funding  
**[0:29:20-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:29:20):**  the the building of I believe 220 housing units as a phase one for our for our housing  
**[0:29:28-0:29:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:29:28):**  complex so right next to our demo site we have a housing development underway we got  
**[0:29:36-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:29:36):**  a police station in the region for the first time which people really wanted we got an  
**[0:29:42-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:29:42):**  ambulance and emergency services in there which the people really needed because otherwise  
**[0:29:48-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:29:48):**  the closest hospital is in Mecca and for parts of Al-Bayda that's an hour and a half away  
**[0:29:55-0:30:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:29:55):**  and a lot of them don't have access to vehicles so you know getting ambulances there was a  
**[0:30:01-0:30:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:30:01):**  big deal we got cell phone service in the region established we got I mean it was Princess  
**[0:30:08-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:30:08):**  Haifa who got the electricity company to install most of the people onto the grid in 2009 so  
**[0:30:15-0:30:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:30:15):**  there's been a lot of things happen outside of the you know environmental regeneration  
**[0:30:21-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:30:21):**  piece which was my primary responsibility that there's a lot to be proud of with this  
**[0:30:29-0:30:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:30:29):**  project and so they're they're essentially watching to see if we can if you know the  
**[0:30:37-0:30:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:30:37):**  project can pull off this comprehensive development and then they've said if it works out then  
**[0:30:43-0:30:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:30:43):**  we will fund you know a thousand more like it.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:30:47):**  That's absolutely remarkable now from the perspective as you see it now do you think  
**[0:30:52-0:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:30:52):**  that the the carrying capacity of these ecosystems as they regenerate can continue to support  
**[0:30:58-0:31:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:30:58):**  the population booms that are being proposed?  
**[0:31:05-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:31:05):**  Well there isn't a population boom happening in the rural areas there's a population boom  
**[0:31:11-0:31:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:31:11):**  happening in the cities and I think I think as more women are educated and as they change  
**[0:31:23-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:31:23):**  they've changed a whole bunch of subsidies they've changed a whole bunch of things that  
**[0:31:28-0:31:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:31:28):**  you know we're will certainly have some unintended consequences but one of those will be the  
**[0:31:34-0:31:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:31:34):**  fall in the birth rate is quite likely.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:31:42):**  I mean I don't I suspect that for instance I had a worker who had two wives and 13 children  
**[0:31:54-0:32:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:31:54):**  but he's also in his 60s and I don't I don't perceive that the the men in their 20s are  
**[0:32:01-0:32:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:32:01):**  gonna have more than one wife and probably not more than you know five or six kids instead  
**[0:32:08-0:32:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:32:08):**  of you know double digits that's in the rural areas in the urban areas it's a very different  
**[0:32:15-0:32:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:32:15):**  story.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:32:16):**  I mean yeah there's always big differences from those regions sure yeah yeah.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:32:23):**  Alright so let's change gears for a second here and switch over to talking about some  
**[0:32:27-0:32:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:32:27):**  of the newer projects that you're working on you decided to go back to school while  
**[0:32:33-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:32:33):**  you were working on this project and as a student at the Stanford I believe it's the  
**[0:32:38-0:32:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:32:38):**  MSX master's program could you talk a little bit about how the focus of your continued  
**[0:32:45-0:32:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:32:45):**  education fits into your aspiration for further ecosystem regeneration projects.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:32:50):**  Yeah so we had this great thing in Saudi Arabia going and I was like okay I know that I can  
**[0:32:57-0:33:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:32:57):**  do the environmental part but how do I turn this into enterprises that was that was the  
**[0:33:05-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:33:05):**  fundamental reason why I decided on you know going to a business school and in part that  
**[0:33:13-0:33:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:33:13):**  was just to learn the process of you know being an entrepreneur and hopefully avoiding  
**[0:33:19-0:33:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:33:19):**  mistakes as I do that.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:33:22):**  Part of that was also because you know my professional network is limited to you know  
**[0:33:30-0:33:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:33:30):**  tribes of Bedouin in Saudi Arabia you know and a few members of a niche sure yeah I had  
**[0:33:39-0:33:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:33:39):**  no network in the US aside from the handful of you know permaculture folks who have been  
**[0:33:44-0:33:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:33:44):**  following me so I knew that I needed to develop that more and then it was to I picked Stanford  
**[0:33:56-0:34:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:33:56):**  because not because it's Stanford but because I thought the that I would find the individuals  
**[0:34:03-0:34:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:34:03):**  who have the resources to fund the kind of enterprises that that I intend to create and  
**[0:34:12-0:34:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:34:12):**  so and I decided on you know enterprise and business because I think if we are looking  
**[0:34:20-0:34:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:34:20):**  at you know regeneration or restoring ecological function I'm not a big believer in the conservation  
**[0:34:28-0:34:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:34:28):**  model yeah you know conservation is we're gonna set apart this piece of earth and nobody  
**[0:34:37-0:34:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:34:37):**  gets to go there and we're just gonna leave it alone and everything else gets to be destroyed  
**[0:34:45-0:34:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:34:45):**  right it almost gives a license for all the rest of it to be almost almost and and that's  
**[0:34:51-0:34:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:34:51):**  just known as the sparing model of agriculture yeah and I'm a believer in the sharing model  
**[0:34:58-0:35:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:34:58):**  of agriculture that's not to say that conservation isn't important or that you know on a granular  
**[0:35:05-0:35:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:35:05):**  scale that it fails conservation is really important but it's not enough to solve the  
**[0:35:11-0:35:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:35:11):**  problems that we face because even though we have lots of conservation we're still destroying  
**[0:35:17-0:35:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:35:17):**  ecosystems and the foundations of you know our civilized life well and the other the  
**[0:35:24-0:35:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:35:24):**  other piece of that is that with conservation you're always asking for money from somebody  
**[0:35:29-0:35:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:35:29):**  else right here it's you're it's hard to get that to justify itself at least in the way  
**[0:35:33-0:35:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:35:33):**  that we value things economically well yeah but also as a nonprofit you're you're a professional  
**[0:35:39-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:35:39):**  begging organization right yeah I've come up with those same conflicts myself and so  
**[0:35:45-0:35:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:35:45):**  what I wanted was something where there is a financial engine driving the expansion of  
**[0:35:53-0:36:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:35:53):**  ecological regeneration and and so I I've been setting out to create enterprises that  
**[0:36:03-0:36:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:36:03):**  do that where they're profitable but by virtue of their operations ecologies and ecosystems  
**[0:36:11-0:36:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:36:11):**  are being restored on places where they've been degraded whether that's you know conventional  
**[0:36:18-0:36:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:36:18):**  ag land or desertified land or degraded or you know what have you in terms of degraded  
**[0:36:26-0:36:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:36:26):**  landscapes that's that's what I was looking for and and Stanford did a lot of that actually  
**[0:36:33-0:36:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:36:33):**  it was a one-year program it was a phenomenal year and and now I'm starting a business well  
**[0:36:44-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:36:44):**  let's jump right into that then let's talk about your new endeavor regenerative resources  
**[0:36:49-0:36:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:36:49):**  you've been alluding to this new project for for a little while now I'm really excited  
**[0:36:53-0:36:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:36:53):**  to hear where this is headed you want to break it so yeah well I was in Stanford there's  
**[0:36:59-0:37:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:36:59):**  a sustainability center there called the Tomcat Center for sustainable energy but they also  
**[0:37:06-0:37:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:37:06):**  dabble in other aspects of sustainability and I had a lot of support there and they  
**[0:37:14-0:37:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:37:14):**  introduced me to some folks who have been involved in something called integrated seawater  
**[0:37:21-0:37:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:37:21):**  agriculture and this is a concept that was I don't want to say invented but founded by  
**[0:37:33-0:37:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:37:33):**  a scientist named Carl Hodges and Carl was one of the founders of biosphere 2 he was  
**[0:37:43-0:37:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:37:43):**  an academic primarily but also an inventor and he came up with this system of using seawater  
**[0:37:51-0:38:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:37:51):**  to grow food through a combination of mangrove agroforestry halophytes which are plants that  
**[0:38:01-0:38:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:38:01):**  grow in seawater and aquaculture so and they did they did a system in Eritrea from 1999  
**[0:38:13-0:38:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:38:13):**  to 2003 where they were exporting shrimp and tilapia to Europe while growing new mangrove  
**[0:38:21-0:38:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:38:21):**  forests as an integral part of the process so what they would do is they would do this  
**[0:38:28-0:38:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:38:28):**  aquaculture they would use the effluent from the aquaculture to flood constructed wetlands  
**[0:38:35-0:38:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:38:35):**  where they would grow mangrove forests but then they would manage those mangrove forests  
**[0:38:41-0:38:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:38:41):**  to create all the feed for the aquaculture right so you start with a desert coast where  
**[0:38:52-0:39:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:38:52):**  there's nothing you do aquaculture which aquaculture tends to be quite polluting because usually  
**[0:39:00-0:39:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:39:00):**  the effluent just goes into the ocean and instead they're creating an ecology that absorbs  
**[0:39:06-0:39:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:39:06):**  that effluent and in turn produces the feed for the aquaculture it's a beautiful elegant  
**[0:39:13-0:39:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:39:13):**  system and one of the effects of that system is the creation of freshwater lenses uphill  
**[0:39:23-0:39:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:39:23):**  of that system so you get these new so a freshwater lens is is how the Pacific Islands have fresh  
**[0:39:35-0:39:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:39:35):**  water you have a layer of seawater in the land and then when it rains and that rain  
**[0:39:42-0:39:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:39:42):**  is absorbed by the land it creates it sits on top of the seawater that's why it's called  
**[0:39:48-0:39:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:39:48):**  a freshwater lens and that's one of the effects of this system where you get a massive increase  
**[0:39:55-0:40:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:39:55):**  in the amount of fresh water in the ground because it's it's forming this lens instead  
**[0:40:02-0:40:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:40:02):**  of running off into the ocean which in turn you can use to do dryland agroforestry which  
**[0:40:08-0:40:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:40:08):**  is what I was doing in Saudi Arabia yeah so we I met with these guys who had done this  
**[0:40:14-0:40:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:40:14):**  in Eritrea and they said we're trying to get this done in Mexico why don't you you know  
**[0:40:21-0:40:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:40:21):**  join us as a co-founder and let's let's build this and that sounded fantastic to me so we  
**[0:40:30-0:40:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:40:30):**  have we have founded regenerative resources corporation and we will be the business is  
**[0:40:40-0:40:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:40:40):**  essentially a combination of mangrove agroforestry seawater aquaculture and dryland agroforestry  
**[0:40:54-0:41:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:40:54):**  but we're also incorporating you know real estate into the business model because we're  
**[0:41:00-0:41:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:41:00):**  you know taking desolate landscapes that aren't worth very much and converting them into productive  
**[0:41:05-0:41:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:41:05):**  ecologies and then there's an ecological services component to the business model as well there's  
**[0:41:13-0:41:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:41:13):**  a lot of boxes tick there it seems like there's going to be quite a bit of complexity in the  
**[0:41:17-0:41:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:41:17):**  way that those cycles interweave yep it's very complex and in fact that being able to  
**[0:41:23-0:41:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:41:23):**  manage that complexity is I think one of our comparative advantages but I also think that  
**[0:41:31-0:41:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:41:31):**  we can have a cost advantage so we in some ways we're the world's first regenerative  
**[0:41:42-0:41:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:41:42):**  shrimp company because we're we are farming shrimp but as an integral part of that operation  
**[0:41:53-0:42:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:41:53):**  we are growing new mangrove forests and there's no pollution there's no use that we don't  
**[0:42:03-0:42:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:42:03):**  need to use synthetic fertilizers there's no pesticide herbicide or fungicide used in  
**[0:42:07-0:42:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:42:07):**  the feed that we grow and we're not polluting the ocean and at the same time we're not using  
**[0:42:18-0:42:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:42:18):**  you know monocrop soy in our feed and so it's there's a real advantage there there's a lot  
**[0:42:28-0:42:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:42:28):**  of advantages there actually that that we're going to be utilizing and so we on our first  
**[0:42:35-0:42:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:42:35):**  side we think we'll break ground in February or March of 2020 sometime Q1 2020 and hopefully  
**[0:42:43-0:42:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:42:43):**  have our first shrimp for sale Q1 of 2021 that's remarkable it's really exciting to  
**[0:42:49-0:42:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:42:49):**  hear about this getting off the ground and the potential that it has especially in these  
**[0:42:56-0:43:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:42:56):**  ecosystems that are all but abandoned at this point and many people have given up on and  
**[0:43:00-0:43:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:43:00):**  I really like the approach that you're looking at it with it's almost like the ecosystem  
**[0:43:05-0:43:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:43:05):**  generation is is really the larger point it's it's the main goal but a lot of people see  
**[0:43:11-0:43:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:43:11):**  that as something that has to be facilitated by outside donors or there can be some kind  
**[0:43:16-0:43:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:43:16):**  of other economic aspect to it whereas you're using farming and real estate development  
**[0:43:22-0:43:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:43:22):**  which are often kind of pointed at as villains that can destroy ecosystems and using them  
**[0:43:26-0:43:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:43:26):**  as tools to reach this larger goal to restore the potential that's incredible and it's it's  
**[0:43:32-0:43:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:43:32):**  really wonderful to hear this this general attitude being applied to more and more enterprises  
**[0:43:38-0:43:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:43:38):**  it's very similar to what I've heard from like Mark Shepherd using the example of him  
**[0:43:42-0:43:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:43:42):**  trying to regenerate a Savannah an oak Savannah in the Midwest and using agriculture as the  
**[0:43:48-0:43:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:43:48):**  tool to do so it's really a flipping the narrative on what people generally considered to be  
**[0:43:54-0:43:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:43:54):**  destructive forces and leveraging them to to fast track these things not just allow  
**[0:43:59-0:44:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:43:59):**  them to regenerate over sort of geological time as they did to begin with that's exactly  
**[0:44:05-0:44:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:44:05):**  right and there's there's some really really curious aspects to this that sometimes I think  
**[0:44:12-0:44:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:44:12):**  back and I'm like this is just this is crazy like I mean when we launch our shrimp brand  
**[0:44:22-0:44:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:44:22):**  the more shrimp people eat the more ecology we can grow so it's a virtuous consumption  
**[0:44:29-0:44:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:44:29):**  yeah right which is everything you've always looked for at the grocery store right at this  
**[0:44:37-0:44:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:44:37):**  point we're still stuck in the cycle of trying to do less bad with our with our consumption  
**[0:44:42-0:44:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:44:42):**  well exactly and it's a tool it's it's taking when we talk about working with nature it  
**[0:44:52-0:44:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:44:52):**  doesn't just mean working with ecologies you know and taking advantage of the efficiencies  
**[0:44:57-0:45:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:44:57):**  of ecology it also means working with human nature right and human nature is to consume  
**[0:45:06-0:45:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:45:06):**  and hoard and acquire and is there a way to harness that to make a positive impact and  
**[0:45:19-0:45:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:45:19):**  I think that's what we're doing you know the the concept of virtuous consumption is it  
**[0:45:25-0:45:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:45:25):**  like there's a big part of me that's like no it's wrong you know it's what we've been  
**[0:45:32-0:45:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:45:32):**  taught for so long well and again and it's in this circumstance we are creating a thing  
**[0:45:41-0:45:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:45:41):**  where the more you consume the better it is for the planet and and that's the implications  
**[0:45:52-0:46:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:45:52):**  are massive and and I didn't realize you know until maybe this was six months ago thinking  
**[0:46:02-0:46:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:46:02):**  through this where I was like wait a minute this completely flips everything on its head  
**[0:46:12-0:46:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:46:12):**  and so I'm extremely excited to be involved in this and to be helping to drive this process  
**[0:46:22-0:46:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:46:22):**  of you know entrepreneurship and creation and regeneration and restoration and it's  
**[0:46:29-0:46:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:46:29):**  it's a beautiful thing I'm extremely excited about it hey me too now before I let you go  
**[0:46:35-0:46:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:46:35):**  here I would love to hear a little bit more about some of the other resources that you  
**[0:46:40-0:46:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:46:40):**  would encourage other people to look into because as you've kind of outlined the potential  
**[0:46:46-0:46:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:46:46):**  for flipping the consumptive model into one that facilitates regeneration what have been  
**[0:46:52-0:46:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:46:52):**  some of the influential or go-to resources that you've used to kind of come up with this  
**[0:46:57-0:47:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:46:57):**  model obviously not just from the program that you did in Stanford yeah ones that are  
**[0:47:02-0:47:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:47:02):**  accessible to listeners out there who can either find it for free or through avenues  
**[0:47:07-0:47:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:47:07):**  of direct teacher or mentorship that I've been come up with similar plans for what applies  
**[0:47:14-0:47:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:47:14):**  to them in their bio region oh man well I've got my webinar series on YouTube that I did  
**[0:47:23-0:47:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:47:23):**  it's called sustainable design masterclass and I've got between 150 and 200 hours of  
**[0:47:31-0:47:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:47:31):**  webinars on there with some really heroic folks much of which is relevant you know to  
**[0:47:40-0:47:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:47:40):**  this to this general discussion but I also think about you know William McDonough's cradle  
**[0:47:50-0:47:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:47:50):**  to cradle book kind of helped shape my mindset on you know it's not the problem isn't that  
**[0:47:58-0:48:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:47:58):**  people are people the problem is you know the way that we produce package transport  
**[0:48:07-0:48:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:48:07):**  and dispose of you know the trappings of life I think about the Rocky Mountain Institute's  
**[0:48:17-0:48:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-neal-spackman-2/#t=0:48:17):**  book Natural Capitalism is a fantastic book that and I read it in I think I read that

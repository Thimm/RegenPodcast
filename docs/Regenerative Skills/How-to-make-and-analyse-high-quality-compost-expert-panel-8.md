**[0:00:15-0:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:00:15):**  an abundant and connected future.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:00:18):**  I'm your host, Oliver Gaucher.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:00:21):**  I am once again honored to be representing my friends at New Society Publishers, the  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:00:26):**  book publishers that were a big inspiration to me even before I started working with ecologies  
**[0:00:31-0:00:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:00:31):**  and natural buildings and way before podcasting.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:00:35):**  Their titles like The Natural Plaster Book and Timber Framing for the Rest of Us really  
**[0:00:39-0:00:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:00:39):**  made me believe that I could build my own home, which I eventually did.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:00:44):**  And later volumes like Ecopreneuring, Unlearn Rewild, and Building Community have offered  
**[0:00:49-0:00:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:00:49):**  tons of inspiration and even helped to shape my worldview.

**[0:00:56-0:01:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:00:56):**  complex challenges in your own life, or sometimes just searching for hope and inspiration in  
**[0:01:01-0:01:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:01:01):**  a crazy world where you don't feel like you fit in, you'll find exactly what you're looking  
**[0:01:06-0:01:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:01:06):**  for and more at newsociety.com.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:01:08):**  Hey, welcome everybody to the eighth of the monthly expert panel discussions.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:01:14):**  Now, as I mentioned before, each month I'll be hosting discussions and debates between  
**[0:01:19-0:01:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:01:19):**  some of the most prominent voices in regenerative agriculture, soil science, restoration land  
**[0:01:24-0:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:01:24):**  management and more.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:01:25):**  Now in this session, I hosted a discussion on how to make and analyze high quality compost  
**[0:01:31-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:01:31):**  with my friends and colleagues at Climate Farmers, a nonprofit organization working  
**[0:01:35-0:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:01:35):**  to advance regenerative agriculture in Europe.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:01:38):**  In this panel, I invited three of the most experienced and influential educators in the  
**[0:01:43-0:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:01:43):**  field of compost production and biological soil amendments.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:01:46):**  This is an area where there is a lot of contention, as you'll see in any online forum on this topic.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:01:52):**  Differences in opinion about bacterial or fungal dominant compost, hot thermophilipe  
**[0:01:57-0:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:01:57):**  composition or cooler and slower techniques, whether compost teas actually work or if prebiotic  
**[0:02:02-0:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:02:02):**  food is more important.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:02:04):**  This is a new and emerging field, so there's a lot of new discoveries all the time.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:02:08):**  But rather than get bogged down in technicalities, I organized this panel to cut through the  
**[0:02:12-0:02:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:02:12):**  confusion and talk about what really works and results in improvement of soil health  
**[0:02:17-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:02:17):**  for growers.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:02:19):**  Now one mistake that I have to own up to is that I screwed up a bit in the scheduling  
**[0:02:22-0:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:02:22):**  coordination with the speakers, and for that reason Charles Dowding and Adrian Goldstack  
**[0:02:27-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:02:27):**  didn't show up until the end.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:02:30):**  We'll get to hear a bit from Charles in the last 15 minutes, but Adrian only comes in  
**[0:02:33-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:02:33):**  during the Q&A portion, which isn't part of this episode.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:02:36):**  Don't worry though, I have plans to do follow up interviews with them both, so we'll hear  
**[0:02:41-0:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:02:41):**  from them in some of the episodes coming up.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:02:44):**  But luckily Troy Hinke of Living Roots Compost Tea was a real hero and carried the discussion  
**[0:02:49-0:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:02:49):**  and all of the questions that I had along the way.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:02:52):**  So don't forget if you want to see the video of the full event, you can check it out on  
**[0:02:55-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:02:55):**  the Climate Farmers YouTube channel through the link in the show notes for this episode.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:03:00):**  Now since these discussions are longer than regular weekly episodes, I'll keep the intro  
**[0:03:03-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:03:03):**  short and jump right into the introductions for our panelists.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:03:07):**  Troy began his career with soils and compost at the Rodale Institute in Kutztown, Pennsylvania,  
**[0:03:14-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:03:14):**  serving as Rodale's compost specialist.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:03:16):**  Troy worked side by side with Dr. Elaine Ingham, who's also been on this panel in the past,  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:03:21):**  performing experiments on large and small scale agricultural production.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:03:26):**  He went on to start and co-manage an organic farm as well as serving as compost specialist  
**[0:03:31-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:03:31):**  for a large windrow composting facility.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:03:34):**  Troy is currently the owner of Living Roots Compost Tea, consulting with growers and composters  
**[0:03:39-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:03:39):**  worldwide.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:03:41):**  He's also the host of What's Brewing?  
**[0:03:43-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:03:43):**  A Compost Podcast.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:03:45):**  So he is well versed in all of these topics.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:03:47):**  So with that said, Troy, why don't you start by giving us a little overview of the work  
**[0:03:53-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:03:53):**  that you do as an entrepreneur in composting?  
**[0:03:56-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:03:56):**  What is that business like and how did you get into it?  
**[0:03:59-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:03:59):**  Hey, so I had originally gotten into this all through taking a, I was in going back  
**[0:04:06-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:04:06):**  to school and took a 28 day class with Elaine, who at the time I didn't know who she was.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:04:12):**  This is back in 2010, 2011.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:04:15):**  And through that class, you know, had a ha ha moment, knew that's exactly what I wanted  
**[0:04:19-0:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:04:19):**  to pursue.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:04:21):**  I went to apprentice with her on the microscope because I wanted to specifically work with  
**[0:04:26-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:04:26):**  her on apprenticing.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:04:27):**  I had no really prior experience with the microscope.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:04:31):**  So I went to Rodale to do that and they liked me a lot and liked my work ethic and brought  
**[0:04:36-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:04:36):**  me on through a compost grant to work alongside her.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:04:41):**  And I just kind of went nuts from there, really delving into it and working.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:04:48):**  I was in Pennsylvania and I moved back to Tennessee and I just recently relocated.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:04:53):**  So while I was in Nashville, I started my own business.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:04:57):**  The living roots business.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:05:00):**  I'd like to change names.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:05:01):**  I originally started off on a suggestion of doing compost tea sprays locally.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:05:05):**  So that's what I started out doing is compost tea sprays for landscapes, lawns, gardens  
**[0:05:10-0:05:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:05:10):**  and farms.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:05:12):**  Basically as an alternative to chemicals for people to use.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:05:17):**  Not that I'm really into lawns, but if people are going to be spraying lawns or landscapes  
**[0:05:20-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:05:20):**  and rather than be using compost tea or something natural and organic than chemicals.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:05:26):**  So I started off doing that and then immediately my business morphed into a lot of consulting.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:05:32):**  So at this point, half of my business has been compost tea sprays and half of it's been  
**[0:05:36-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:05:36):**  consulting with now people around the world who want to consult on compost making, compost  
**[0:05:44-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:05:44):**  tea, compost tea brewing, microscopy, soil food web knowledge, anything like that that  
**[0:05:49-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:05:49):**  has to do with soil food web compost or soils.  
**[0:05:54-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:05:54):**  And then now I'm kind of morphing my business because I'm in the Northeast now.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:06:00):**  I just relocated back to Pennsylvania near Kutztown.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:06:02):**  So I'm back near Rodale.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:06:06):**  And I don't really know what's going to happen.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:06:08):**  I think I might start putting out more products.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:06:10):**  I'd kind of like to change my name.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:06:11):**  I feel like the compost tea name kind of puts me in a very small closet and not many people  
**[0:06:20-0:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:06:20):**  pay attention to what's going on with what I'm doing because of that.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:06:24):**  And I do a lot, whole lot more than compost tea, especially, you know, compost compost  
**[0:06:28-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:06:28):**  is the basis of compost tea.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:06:30):**  So I really specialize in that and soil microbiology.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:06:34):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:06:35):**  Well, look, so there is such a wide definition of compost out there.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:06:40):**  And I think this is where people get confused.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:06:43):**  And we've identified this as one of the key points that farmers are working to get better  
**[0:06:47-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:06:47):**  at because of how important it can be for kickstarting soil health.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:06:52):**  But because there are so many different types out there, everything from hot composting  
**[0:06:56-0:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:06:56):**  methods, cold composting, and even vermicompost and Bokashi, which is more of a fermentation,  
**[0:07:02-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:07:02):**  all get lumped into these, as well as a misunderstanding of whether or not this works as fertilizer  
**[0:07:08-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:07:08):**  or whether it's inoculant for microbiology into the soil that releases the nutrients  
**[0:07:13-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:07:13):**  and the minerals that are already in there.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:07:15):**  Can you give us an overview about these different types that I've mentioned and what some of  
**[0:07:18-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:07:18):**  the key importances are or differences are between them?  
**[0:07:23-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:07:23):**  Yeah, so I usually refer to compost as an inoculant or inoculum, where you're going  
**[0:07:32-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:07:32):**  to be inoculating your soil with the biology that's contained within compost.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:07:37):**  Most people think that compost or compost tea is full of nutrients, and that's what  
**[0:07:41-0:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:07:41):**  works for the plants, which is true in a way, but it's because of the microorganisms making  
**[0:07:46-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:07:46):**  those nutrients available.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:07:48):**  So the most nutrients in the world in soil is held in microorganisms.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:07:55):**  It's a matter of cycling those nutrients and working with nature and working with those  
**[0:08:01-0:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:08:01):**  microorganisms to get the nutrients that are contained within those microorganisms to plants,  
**[0:08:08-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:08:08):**  and plants have a symbiotic relationship with these microorganisms, with bacteria and fungi,  
**[0:08:13-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:08:13):**  where the plants can manage their own needs.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:08:16):**  It's just a matter of getting the biology correct in the soil.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:08:20):**  So in different types of composting, you had mentioned you've got vermicomposting, thermophilic  
**[0:08:27-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:08:27):**  composting, static composting, Bokashi, which I'm not necessarily a fan of, black soldier  
**[0:08:34-0:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:08:34):**  fly composting, anaerobic digestion.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:08:39):**  There's a lot of different things, but the key point is that microorganisms are breaking  
**[0:08:43-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:08:43):**  down organic matter and making these nutrients available to plants, and it's the whole kind  
**[0:08:50-0:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:08:50):**  of circle of life that happens within nature or a forest system or something like that.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:08:56):**  So with these different types of composts, you're going to have varying degrees of quality.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:09:05):**  I focus more on aerobic composting and aerobic compost, aerobic microorganisms.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:09:14):**  So with other types of anaerobic composting, you're going to have anaerobic microorganisms  
**[0:09:21-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:09:21):**  that are breaking down or taking over the material, but then in the end, you still have  
**[0:09:26-0:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:09:26):**  to allow that stuff to age or cure and allow the aerobic or aerobes to come and take over  
**[0:09:34-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:09:34):**  and finish the compost.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:09:37):**  With what I'm doing or what I'm trying to teach folks through farms or on their own  
**[0:09:43-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:09:43):**  home use is to try and get compost.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:09:47):**  It depends on your situation, but for most people, they're trying to get compost as quickly  
**[0:09:51-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:09:51):**  as they can, and I'm wanting them to get as much biology as they can through that compost.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:09:55):**  So what I'm teaching people or the ones that I focus on are going to be focusing on managing  
**[0:10:01-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:10:01):**  according to the biology in the compost or in that organic matter, and then trying to  
**[0:10:06-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:10:06):**  enhance that biology to bring about more populations and break it down even more.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:10:13):**  So along those lines and what you're trying to achieve, even though there are a wide range  
**[0:10:17-0:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:10:17):**  of techniques and materials that you can use to achieve that, how do you go about assessing  
**[0:10:22-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:10:22):**  the health of a compost pile and assuring that it has the microbial and fungal populations  
**[0:10:28-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:10:28):**  that you're looking for to get the results that you can really work with and apply into  
**[0:10:33-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:10:33):**  your own soil?  
**[0:10:34-0:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:10:34):**  How do you analyze that through the process?  
**[0:10:37-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:10:37):**  Well, I'm using a microscope throughout, so I'm able to take a sample and look to see,  
**[0:10:45-0:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:10:45):**  do I have a diversity of bacteria?  
**[0:10:48-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:10:48):**  Do I have any fungi in there?  
**[0:10:50-0:10:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:10:50):**  What about protozoa, like different amoeba, flagellates?  
**[0:10:54-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:10:54):**  What am I working with?  
**[0:10:55-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:10:55):**  If you don't have access to a microscope, you're going to kind of have to basically  
**[0:11:01-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:11:01):**  go off of what you're seeing and smelling.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:11:04):**  So if you're seeing a good amount of breakdown, let's say you're not seeing a good amount  
**[0:11:09-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:11:09):**  of breakdown, let's say you're seeing a compost that's full of woody tissue and wood chips,  
**[0:11:17-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:11:17):**  either it hasn't been fully composted or there's not a lot of microorganisms that are in there  
**[0:11:23-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:11:23):**  that you're having a lot of chunks of wood chips or maybe even other material that's  
**[0:11:29-0:11:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:11:29):**  just not getting broken down because you don't have the biology there to break it down or  
**[0:11:34-0:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:11:34):**  for some reason the way you've managed the pile, there's not enough water or moisture  
**[0:11:39-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:11:39):**  to help the biology or you've allowed it to get really super hot or go anaerobic to where  
**[0:11:48-0:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:11:48):**  other types of microorganisms have taken over and you're not getting a lot of good breakdown.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:11:53):**  So if you're not using a microscope, the best way to judge is over two months, four months,  
**[0:11:59-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:11:59):**  six months, are you getting a continuous breakdown, a nice breakdown of material or is it kind  
**[0:12:05-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:12:05):**  of look about the same as it did at two months, at four months, and six months?  
**[0:12:09-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:12:09):**  The ways to make sure that you're keeping the biology going is you want to make sure  
**[0:12:15-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:12:15):**  that you're getting air in there somehow, every so often at least, and you want to make  
**[0:12:20-0:12:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:12:20):**  sure that you're keeping your pile moist but not too wet.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:12:24):**  So the consistency of a rung out sponge is the way that most people like to describe  
**[0:12:28-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:12:28):**  it or 50% moisture.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:12:30):**  These microorganisms that we're working with need moisture in order to function and thrive  
**[0:12:37-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:12:37):**  and survive and go on reproducing.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:12:41):**  So you need to provide them with the moisture, you need to make sure that your material is  
**[0:12:44-0:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:12:44):**  staying moist, but just like if you have some moisture, if you water your lawn for 10 minutes,  
**[0:12:51-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:12:51):**  it's going to help it, but if you flood your lawn to where it's just sitting in water,  
**[0:12:56-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:12:56):**  that's not going to be beneficial at all.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:12:58):**  Same with compost, you want some water, but if you're flooding it to where you've just  
**[0:13:02-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:13:02):**  got too much water and causing it to go anaerobic, that's not going to be good.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:13:06):**  But I always like to use food.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:13:10):**  Humans preserve food through a few different ways.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:13:13):**  We use salt or we use like bags or airtight containers and we dehydrate food.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:13:22):**  So the reason that we dehydrate food, like you put fruit in a dehydrator or produce in  
**[0:13:27-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:13:27):**  a dehydrator, you're taking away the moisture because you're not wanting any microorganisms  
**[0:13:33-0:13:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:13:33):**  or mold or bacteria to come in onto the surfaces of your banana or your mango and to break  
**[0:13:40-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:13:40):**  it down.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:13:41):**  You want to dry it out so that microorganisms aren't able to really live on the surface  
**[0:13:47-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:13:47):**  there.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:13:48):**  So also, you know, we dehydrate food, we put stuff in an airtight container because we  
**[0:13:53-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:13:53):**  don't want that air to get in there.  
**[0:13:56-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:13:56):**  In the opposite effect, we want to enhance these microorganisms in compost.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:13:59):**  So we need air, we need moisture.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:14:02):**  We're trying to get things to break down, unlike leaving your sandwich out or your loaf  
**[0:14:06-0:14:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:14:06):**  of bread out on the counter, you know, or putting it away as opposed to leaving it on  
**[0:14:13-0:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:14:13):**  the counter.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:14:14):**  I mean, because if you leave it out on the counter, your bread is going to get moldy  
**[0:14:16-0:14:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:14:16):**  or your sandwich is going to get moldy.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:14:18):**  We want to enhance those microorganisms that are going to break down this organic matter  
**[0:14:22-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:14:22):**  in compost.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:14:24):**  So the best method that you can come about to compost to achieve that is what you're  
**[0:14:32-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:14:32):**  going to go for.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:14:33):**  And yeah, in my experience, vermicompost is a great way to provide biology and break things  
**[0:14:39-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:14:39):**  down or thermophilic composting, different ways of thermophilic composting is a great  
**[0:14:45-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:14:45):**  way too.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:14:46):**  It's all in how you manage the pile though.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:14:48):**  Now you're talking a lot about getting air into the pile, anaerobically decomposing the  
**[0:14:55-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:14:55):**  organic matter that you're using.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:14:57):**  But there are some people who also advocate for aerobic or sorry, anaerobic, I had it  
**[0:15:02-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:15:02):**  the other way around.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:15:03):**  It's aerobic if it's got oxygen and it's anaerobic if it doesn't.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:15:09):**  And so anaerobic decomposition also has the potential for some benefits.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:15:13):**  I've heard it advocated by certain sources and can break down and make bioavailable some  
**[0:15:19-0:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:15:19):**  difficult minerals that otherwise aren't water soluble.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:15:22):**  Is there a use for anaerobic compost or are the negative aspects of it sort of too dangerous  
**[0:15:29-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:15:29):**  or kind of outweigh the benefits?  
**[0:15:32-0:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:15:32):**  Yeah, it has its place.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:15:37):**  There are gigantic anaerobic digesters that people are able to turn a lot of food scraps  
**[0:15:43-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:15:43):**  into I would call it a, I wouldn't call it compost, I would call it a compostable material.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:15:50):**  So you're breaking it down with these anaerobes.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:15:54):**  But then that's what I was saying, you have to put it through a curing process where it's  
**[0:15:58-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:15:58):**  going to age and you allow air into it after that anaerobic process.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:16:05):**  So yeah, it has its place.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:16:09):**  Trying to break down a lot of food scraps, it may be easier because due to space in a  
**[0:16:16-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:16:16):**  city or something like that, it may be easier to put it through an anaerobic digester.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:16:22):**  Or if you're like worm composting, people on a large scale with doing large scale worm  
**[0:16:29-0:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:16:29):**  composting will do what's called pre-composting where they're putting something through a  
**[0:16:34-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:16:34):**  thermophilic phase before they feed it to worms in order to break or to kill pathogens  
**[0:16:40-0:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:16:40):**  and weed seeds.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:16:44):**  So using an anaerobic, if you, you know, say you don't have a lot of real estate that you  
**[0:16:49-0:16:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:16:49):**  can be making thermophilic windrows or piles or something like that, but you do have a  
**[0:16:54-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:16:54):**  small basement space or something in a warehouse or something like that, you know, you could  
**[0:17:00-0:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:17:00):**  have an anaerobic digester where you're putting it through the anaerobic digester to put it  
**[0:17:06-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:17:06):**  through the thermophilic process and then take that and feed it to worms.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:17:09):**  So it has its place, everything has its place.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:17:13):**  It's just my preference to do other type of composting.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:17:16):**  Yeah, I don't, it's not, I don't look down on those things or it's not like I think that  
**[0:17:23-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:17:23):**  they're bad.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:17:24):**  Everything has its place.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:17:25):**  It's just a matter of your environment and what you have to work with.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:17:31):**  And so getting rid of pathogens, and especially killing weed seeds is one of the benefits  
**[0:17:37-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:17:37):**  of thermophilic compost, getting it up to heat so that those organisms can't thrive  
**[0:17:42-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:17:42):**  and that those seeds can't germinate.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:17:44):**  Are there any other ways of eliminating those risks without having to bring it up to temperature?  
**[0:17:50-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:17:50):**  Or is that only achieved by reaching a minimal temperature?  
**[0:17:55-0:17:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:17:55):**  Worms can also help to break down pathogens.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:17:58):**  If the other lady was here, she might not be able to answer this question better.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:18:02):**  I know she's worked a lot with microbes.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:18:05):**  I know from my experience and what I've learned that if you were to not have necessarily put  
**[0:18:13-0:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:18:13):**  something through the thermophilic phase, but feed it to worms, as long as worms work  
**[0:18:18-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:18:18):**  most of that material, they're going to be breaking down pathogens.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:18:23):**  And over time, if you have, you know, like a static compost pile, if you're just like  
**[0:18:30-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:18:30):**  a backyard gardener who's throwing stuff into a heap, you know, you throw some grass in  
**[0:18:35-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:18:35):**  there, you throw some food scraps in there, you know, you may have some pathogens at first,  
**[0:18:39-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:18:39):**  but over time, as it ages and goes more aerobic, if you're able to turn it and work with it  
**[0:18:47-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:18:47):**  and manage it, you know, over a year's time, it should be that you're getting rid of those.  
**[0:18:56-0:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:18:56):**  As long as you're keeping it aerobic and not too wet, you should be getting rid of those  
**[0:18:59-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:18:59):**  pathogens.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:19:00):**  All right, so let's go through other types of composting, starting with the fungal or  
**[0:19:08-0:19:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:19:08):**  the bacterial dominant types.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:19:10):**  There seems to be a lot of hype right now around fungal dominant compost and the advantages  
**[0:19:15-0:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:19:15):**  that they have for creating a forest floor like environment in which a lot of different  
**[0:19:20-0:19:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:19:20):**  plants can thrive, essentially.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:19:26):**  First of all, I've also heard that it's not possible to create fungal dominance in compost,  
**[0:19:32-0:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:19:32):**  that that's something of a myth that it can have more fungal life, but it's unlikely to  
**[0:19:37-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:19:37):**  ever be dominant in comparison to the bacterial life.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:19:41):**  And second of all, are there real benefits to doing it this way, or is it just something  
**[0:19:46-0:19:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:19:46):**  new that we're starting to discover as we learn more about mycology?  
**[0:19:51-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:19:51):**  So according to research that's been done in the past 10 to 20 years, it is beneficial  
**[0:19:59-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:19:59):**  to get fungi, more fungi going into your soils.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:20:04):**  So my, over the past 10 years that I've been doing this, since I worked with Elaine, my  
**[0:20:07-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:20:07):**  entire goal has to be to get more and more fungal compost, or get compost that's more  
**[0:20:13-0:20:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:20:13):**  and more fungal, more fungi in it or fungal dominant.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:20:19):**  It can be extremely difficult, it depends on your starting materials from my experience.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:20:25):**  So I worked with a guy, I consulted with a guy who was getting a lot of material from  
**[0:20:31-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:20:31):**  large old forests in California.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:20:34):**  He somehow was able to get wood chips that they were cutting down like these super old  
**[0:20:40-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:20:40):**  trees in a national forest, and he was composting that with palm leaves and then feeding it  
**[0:20:47-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:20:47):**  to worms.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:20:48):**  So these huge old trees were full of fungi, because fungi is not just in the soil, but  
**[0:20:53-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:20:53):**  it's within tree, the architecture of the tree or the body of the tree, and sorry there's  
**[0:21:00-0:21:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:21:00):**  like a wasp or something, and on the surfaces of the outside, so on the foliage.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:21:06):**  So he's getting this material that's already full of fungi, composting it and feeding it  
**[0:21:12-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:21:12):**  to worms, so he's got a very fungal dominant material to start with, and so when you look  
**[0:21:17-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:21:17):**  at his stuff underneath the microscope, it's definitely fungal dominant.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:21:23):**  Dr. David Johnson, who he and his partner or wife do the Johnson-Sue bioreactor, I think  
**[0:21:35-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:21:35):**  is what they call it, they have a certain method of composting, and he's shown that  
**[0:21:41-0:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:21:41):**  he can get fungal dominance through making compost this way.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:21:45):**  You can find a video on YouTube if you want to look it up after this session, but he's  
**[0:21:50-0:21:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:21:50):**  found that you can apply this compost that he's made that has become fungal dominant  
**[0:21:56-0:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:21:56):**  at a rate of one ton per acre, which is barely anything, if you can think of one ton or like  
**[0:22:05-0:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:22:05):**  basically a couple cubic yards of compost onto one acre, and he's been able to change  
**[0:22:11-0:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:22:11):**  the biology in the soil and advance it in succession to where he's getting more fungi,  
**[0:22:17-0:22:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:22:17):**  and he's using, again, so that you would be considering that compost on inoculant, you're  
**[0:22:22-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:22:22):**  inoculating the soil with compost in order to get these microorganisms into the soil.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:22:29):**  So yeah, and then you had Elaine on, I don't know how much she talked about succession,  
**[0:22:35-0:22:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:22:35):**  but in plant succession, if you were to go out and disturb soil through tilling or just  
**[0:22:43-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:22:43):**  taking away the vegetation on something, you would be making that soil bacterial dominant,  
**[0:22:49-0:22:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:22:49):**  and then as you start, you're going to start out with some pioneer weeds that come up there,  
**[0:22:53-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:22:53):**  and then if you continue to let vegetation grow and not disrupt it, you're going to move  
**[0:22:57-0:23:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:22:57):**  through succession from pioneer weeds to grasses to shrubs to trees to forests, and as you're  
**[0:23:03-0:23:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:23:03):**  moving through succession, you're going from bacterial dominant soils to equal ratio of  
**[0:23:09-0:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:23:09):**  bacteria to fungi to forest systems, which are going to be fungal dominant.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:23:14):**  So what people are trying to achieve through this method is to get more fungi in the soil  
**[0:23:20-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:23:20):**  to a place where the biology is correct as to the kind of crops that you're, crop or  
**[0:23:27-0:23:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:23:27):**  crops that you're growing.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:23:29):**  Did that answer your question, Foley?  
**[0:23:31-0:23:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:23:31):**  Yeah, yeah, that's a really good start.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:23:32):**  Well, let's go a little deeper into that now.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:23:35):**  There's the idea that certain types of compost might be better for certain types of crops  
**[0:23:40-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:23:40):**  or for certain types of growing methods.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:23:43):**  Since you've worked with growers in many different places, have you found that there is any noticeable  
**[0:23:48-0:23:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:23:48):**  difference in the type of composting method used for things like market gardens or for  
**[0:23:53-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:23:53):**  tree planting efforts or for broad scale applications that are significantly better than others?  
**[0:24:02-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:24:02):**  I'm trying to clarify that I have your question correct.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:24:05):**  You're asking that are there certain types of composting, like is thermophilic windrow  
**[0:24:11-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:24:11):**  composting better at producing compost for a certain type of crop than like vermicompost?  
**[0:24:16-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:24:16):**  Is that what you're trying to ask?  
**[0:24:18-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:24:18):**  Yes, exactly.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:24:19):**  If there's tailored types of composting that are better or worse for certain types of growing  
**[0:24:23-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:24:23):**  or certain types of crops?  
**[0:24:28-0:24:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:24:28):**  I wouldn't necessarily say it's the type of composting as much as the quality, but you're  
**[0:24:36-0:24:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:24:36):**  going to have certain types of methods or ways of management that are going to produce  
**[0:24:42-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:24:42):**  better biology in your compost.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:24:44):**  So the Johnson-Sue bioreactor, they've come up with a way that they're able to really  
**[0:24:53-0:24:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:24:53):**  enhance the biology and get a lot more fungi going.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:24:56):**  Or I found I really wasn't a fan of aerated static piles at first.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:25:04):**  And then when I was able to control the feedstocks on my own and practice it on my own scale  
**[0:25:09-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:25:09):**  and at home, I was getting extremely good biology.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:25:15):**  And like I said, vermicompost is normally going to give you really good biology.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:25:20):**  So most vermicompost is going to be more bacterial dominant than fungal dominant.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:25:25):**  So this is kind of a weird situation too, though, because people have found that vermicompost  
**[0:25:33-0:25:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:25:33):**  is great for grapes and grapes should have more fungi in the soil or equal amount fungal  
**[0:25:41-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:25:41):**  to bacterial ratio.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:25:43):**  But people have a great success with using vermicompost on different vineyards.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:25:52):**  That could be like a long drawn out answer as far as you're trying to get to.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:25:57):**  But yeah, really, it's the management of any of the types of composting that you're doing.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:26:05):**  It's the management of it, of paying attention to biology or knowing when to like add air  
**[0:26:11-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:26:11):**  or turn a pile or things like that in order to focus on good biology and beneficial biology.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:26:21):**  But yeah, so like from the experience and research that's been done, like the David  
**[0:26:28-0:26:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:26:28):**  Johnson, the Johnson-Sue bioreactor, that type of fungal dominant compost should be  
**[0:26:32-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:26:32):**  better for, you know, more tree crops, or most any soil is going to be lacking fungi.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:26:41):**  So anytime you can get compost that's more fungal dominant to try and you're trying to  
**[0:26:47-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:26:47):**  balance out a soil, so you're trying to add fungi to the soil.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:26:51):**  So most any soil is going to need more fungi, basically, no matter what crop you're doing,  
**[0:26:56-0:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:26:56):**  as long as it's not, you know, just like lettuce or some early succession crop.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:27:02):**  I hope that makes sense.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:27:03):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:27:05):**  And that makes me wonder what your experience and relationship with using Bokashi is, because  
**[0:27:10-0:27:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:27:10):**  it's kind of an outlier in the composting world.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:27:12):**  It often gets lumped in with composting methods, but technically it's a type of fermentation  
**[0:27:18-0:27:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:27:18):**  that is often used more as a fertilizer, rather than a bacterial rich compost, as we normally  
**[0:27:26-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:27:26):**  think about it.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:27:27):**  Would you include that in the list of composting methods, or does it really stand alone as  
**[0:27:31-0:27:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:27:31):**  a separate type of soil improvement and fertilizer?  
**[0:27:37-0:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:27:37):**  I would consider it part of a composting method.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:27:41):**  So I know people take Bokashi and put it directly onto plants and have some results.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:27:47):**  What I'm trying to do through making compost is get a diversity of microorganisms.  
**[0:27:54-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:27:54):**  So by using a diversity of materials as feedstocks and starting materials, you know, a piece  
**[0:28:01-0:28:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:28:01):**  of hay, certain type of hay is going to have certain bacteria and protozoa on it, where,  
**[0:28:08-0:28:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:28:08):**  you know, wood chips and things like that are going to have other types of bacteria  
**[0:28:11-0:28:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:28:11):**  and fungi on it.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:28:12):**  So you put those together and you're going to get more diversity.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:28:16):**  With Bokashi, I went to the NC State Vermiculture Conference in 2019, and there was a guy there  
**[0:28:26-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:28:26):**  named Zach, Dr. Zach something, from the Rocky Mountain Soil Institute is what I think he  
**[0:28:35-0:28:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:28:35):**  calls it.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:28:36):**  He has a DNA sequencer, and he had done DNA sequencing on compost tea, vermicompost, Bokashi,  
**[0:28:42-0:28:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:28:42):**  and like one other thing.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:28:44):**  And so like compost tea, he did DNA sequencing, and it was just like tons of different DNA,  
**[0:28:50-0:28:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:28:50):**  just all kinds of like a super big diversity of microorganisms.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:28:53):**  With Bokashi, it was 99% bacillus.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:28:57):**  So you're pretty much getting all the same type of bacteria in Bokashi, whereas I'm trying  
**[0:29:04-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:29:04):**  to get, like I said, I'm trying to get a diversity of species.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:29:07):**  So if you use, you know, if you're an apartment dweller who chooses not to have like an indoor  
**[0:29:15-0:29:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:29:15):**  worm bin, or you want to do Bokashi, it can be a good way to break down food scraps before,  
**[0:29:22-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:29:22):**  you know, like feeding, you could do Bokashi and then put that into an outdoor compost  
**[0:29:28-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:29:28):**  pile or do Bokashi and then put that, feed that to worms.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:29:32):**  I would consider it like another type of kind of pre-composting or breaking stuff down in  
**[0:29:38-0:29:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:29:38):**  order to get it ready for composting that's going to make it healthy, full of healthy  
**[0:29:44-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:29:44):**  aerobic microorganisms.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:29:45):**  Well, so we were talking a second ago about the feed materials for compost and how that  
**[0:29:51-0:29:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:29:51):**  can contribute to the diversity of microorganisms and fungi that are in there.  
**[0:29:56-0:30:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:29:56):**  Let's go over some of the common feed and materials that are used for composting and  
**[0:30:02-0:30:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:30:02):**  what they can help to promote and some that are either overrated or downright incorrect  
**[0:30:07-0:30:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:30:07):**  or often troublesome in composting piles.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:30:10):**  Maybe starting with your carbon sources and dividing them between the carbon and the nitrogen  
**[0:30:15-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:30:15):**  sources.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:30:17):**  Yeah, so carbon sources, you have browns and you have greens.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:30:23):**  I think most people are familiar with both of these terms.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:30:25):**  The greens are going to be more nitrogenous materials where the browns are going to be  
**[0:30:29-0:30:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:30:29):**  more carbonaceous materials.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:30:32):**  So brown or carbon material is going to be wood chips, stalks, sticks, paper, cardboard,  
**[0:30:41-0:30:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:30:41):**  sawdust, anything that's woody, got a lot of carbon, lignin, something that's going  
**[0:30:50-0:30:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:30:50):**  to be harder to break down.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:30:53):**  That's going to be a carbon source, whereas green material is going to be anything that's  
**[0:30:57-0:31:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:30:57):**  easier to break down or anything that's cut green or even food scraps.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:31:04):**  So grass, green leaves, not dead leaves in the fall or autumn, but green leaves, weeds.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:31:16):**  So straw and hay are the exact same plant.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:31:21):**  Hay is cut when it's green, straw is cut when it's brown, but it's the exact same plant.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:31:27):**  So if you cut it green and it's hay, that would be considered a green source, whereas  
**[0:31:32-0:31:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:31:32):**  you cut it brown and all the protein, sugars, and carbohydrates have gone seeped into the  
**[0:31:37-0:31:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:31:37):**  roots for the season, that's going to be considered a brown source.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:31:42):**  So straw, brown, hay, green.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:31:46):**  We were kind of talking about succession before and bacteria and fungi.  
**[0:31:51-0:32:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:31:51):**  So green material is going to be more of a bacterial food and brown or carbonaceous material  
**[0:32:00-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:32:00):**  is going to be more of a fungal food.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:32:02):**  So if you're trying to get more fungi into a pile, you'd want to have over 50% or majority  
**[0:32:09-0:32:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:32:09):**  brown material.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:32:11):**  There is a point where you can get too much brown material.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:32:14):**  I would say the threshold that I've experienced is somewhere around 75 or 80% brown to the  
**[0:32:22-0:32:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:32:22):**  rest green, either nitrogen or high nitrogen.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:32:32):**  You can also have too much nitrogen.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:32:35):**  So I was working with one farm and they couldn't get their piles to heat up and I was suggesting  
**[0:32:39-0:32:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:32:39):**  they had some odd starting materials and I wasn't really, couldn't really figure out  
**[0:32:44-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:32:44):**  what their issue was and they ended up sending in a test, a chemical analysis and they realized  
**[0:32:49-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:32:49):**  they had too much nitrogen.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:32:52):**  So they actually had to get more carbon into the compost to get it to heat up.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:32:57):**  And generally when you're trying to do thermophilic compost and not getting temperatures or not,  
**[0:33:02-0:33:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:33:02):**  you're not getting the thermophilic temperatures that you want, you generally want to add more  
**[0:33:08-0:33:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:33:08):**  nitrogen or a high nitrogen source, which would be manure or a luminous plant or alfalfa.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:33:17):**  Was there any other part of that question I didn't answer?  
**[0:33:19-0:33:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:33:19):**  No, no, those are really good start and those are the common ones that people are from working  
**[0:33:24-0:33:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:33:24):**  with.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:33:25):**  Let's talk a little bit about wood sources, wood chips specifically, and the difference  
**[0:33:30-0:33:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:33:30):**  between coniferous trees and deciduous trees, that kind of wood can make a difference.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:33:36):**  How big or small the pieces are can determine how quickly it breaks down and also the types  
**[0:33:41-0:33:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:33:41):**  of microbial life or fungal life that it promotes as well as, I mean, so we're just kind of  
**[0:33:47-0:33:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:33:47):**  generally talking about wood sources here, but also the concern that it can absorb or  
**[0:33:53-0:33:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:33:53):**  extract nutrients from the soil if it's not properly broken down.  
**[0:33:57-0:34:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:33:57):**  Can you kind of just talk about that as a material and how it fits into healthy, sort  
**[0:34:02-0:34:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:34:02):**  of robust and diverse compost?  
**[0:34:06-0:34:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:34:06):**  Yeah, first you mentioned like the particle size.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:34:11):**  So I generally tell people to stick with material that's like, like if you're going to go with  
**[0:34:17-0:34:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:34:17):**  wood chips, something that's two to three inches or smaller, nothing too bigger than  
**[0:34:22-0:34:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:34:22):**  that, because we do need some fluff in a compost pile, something that's going to be porous  
**[0:34:27-0:34:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:34:27):**  and allow for air movement throughout the pile.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:34:31):**  I, while we're on the subject, I'm going to mention sawdust.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:34:38):**  A little bit of sawdust is good.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:34:40):**  What's really weird about sawdust is it has an extremely high carbon to nitrogen ratio,  
**[0:34:45-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:34:45):**  so you would think that sawdust, it's like more broken down, it'd be easier to break  
**[0:34:49-0:34:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:34:49):**  down, but because it has such a, once you turn it into sawdust, it creates such a high  
**[0:34:53-0:34:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:34:53):**  carbon to nitrogen ratio, it's actually harder, it takes longer to break down.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:34:58):**  Sawdust, I just talked about the breathability, and if you've got a lot of small material,  
**[0:35:05-0:35:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:35:05):**  like some coffee grounds are good, but you wouldn't want to load a pile down with something  
**[0:35:09-0:35:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:35:09):**  like coffee grounds or sawdust because you know, like you buy a bag of flour, think of  
**[0:35:14-0:35:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:35:14):**  how much air is going to flow through that material because it's such a small particle  
**[0:35:18-0:35:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:35:18):**  size.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:35:19):**  So you want chunky stuff, you want fluff, you want a variety and diversity of material  
**[0:35:24-0:35:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:35:24):**  sizes to begin with as well.  
**[0:35:25-0:35:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:35:25):**  So from tiny to two to three inches is about what I stick with.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:35:32):**  If you're throwing sticks and stalks in there that are longer, if you're turning this stuff  
**[0:35:37-0:35:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:35:37):**  by hand, it can be really difficult to hit some pieces of material that are like two  
**[0:35:42-0:35:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:35:42):**  feet long and then it's like catching all this other material and you happen to lift  
**[0:35:46-0:35:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:35:46):**  like 50 pounds at once, that can be really difficult when you're doing it by hand.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:35:51):**  Yeah, that was a mistake I made in my early days.  
**[0:35:54-0:36:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:35:54):**  Yeah, it sticks in your pitchfork and makes it such a hassle.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:36:02):**  So as far as like the putting wood chips into, I think that it's been talked about a lot  
**[0:36:12-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:36:12):**  now that you don't want to be putting wood chips directly into soil or mixing wood chips  
**[0:36:16-0:36:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:36:16):**  into soil and most people are worried about it robbing the soil of nitrogen and you're  
**[0:36:23-0:36:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:36:23):**  trying to put fresh plants in there that need this nitrogen.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:36:26):**  People have had luck by putting in wood chips or adding wood chips to certain things but  
**[0:36:31-0:36:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:36:31):**  then also adding like a bone or blood meal so that they're adding a high nitrogen source  
**[0:36:36-0:36:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:36:36):**  to make up for the nitrogen that's taken up.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:36:38):**  So I don't have a chemistry background.  
**[0:36:42-0:36:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:36:42):**  Again, this might be a better question for the lady who was going to be here.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:36:51):**  My understanding would be that even though wood chips are more of a fungal food, you're  
**[0:36:57-0:37:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:36:57):**  going to be having bacteria that's coming in to, you've got a lot of sap and sugary  
**[0:37:01-0:37:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:37:01):**  stuff that they're going to be on the wood chips.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:37:04):**  So right at first, for the first month or so, you're going to be having bacteria that  
**[0:37:08-0:37:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:37:08):**  are going to be grabbing onto those wood chips and eating away at the sugars and the saps  
**[0:37:12-0:37:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:37:12):**  and things like that.  
**[0:37:13-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:37:13):**  I believe that that's why because this bacteria is going to be where your source of nitrogen,  
**[0:37:19-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:37:19):**  like I said in the beginning of our conversation, the nutrients are held within these microorganisms.  
**[0:37:25-0:37:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:37:25):**  Charles is here now, I see.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:37:28):**  The nutrients are going to be held within these microorganisms.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:37:32):**  So if you've got all this bacteria that's migrating to the wood chips to break down  
**[0:37:36-0:37:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:37:36):**  these sugar sources and saps and things like that, then they're going to be taking away  
**[0:37:39-0:37:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:37:39):**  from nitrogen that you might have for plants.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:37:41):**  So that's my understanding of that.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:37:45):**  I think I answered all the parts of your question there.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:37:48):**  Yeah, yeah, that was a really good breakdown.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:37:50):**  I really appreciate it.  
**[0:37:51-0:37:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:37:51):**  And let me just introduce Charles since he's got here.  
**[0:37:54-0:37:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:37:54):**  And thanks for holding down the fort until now, Troy.  
**[0:37:56-0:37:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:37:56):**  Hey, Charles, how's it going?  
**[0:37:58-0:38:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:37:58):**  I'm really glad you're able to make it.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:38:01):**  I hope he can hear us.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:38:03):**  If you want, I could field another question until he gets online here.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:38:09):**  Well, let me quickly give his introduction because I have a feeling he'll be available  
**[0:38:13-0:38:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:38:13):**  in just a second.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:38:14):**  So for anybody who doesn't know Charles Dowding, since 1982, Charles has created and cropped  
**[0:38:20-0:38:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:38:20):**  four no-dig market gardens on different soils from stone to silt to clay.  
**[0:38:25-0:38:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:38:25):**  And in the 1980s, he cropped 7.5 acres, which is three hectares, of no-dig beds.  
**[0:38:31-0:38:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:38:31):**  Currently, he grows vegetables on a third of an acre in Somerset in southwest England,  
**[0:38:36-0:38:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:38:36):**  which is zone eight on your frost zones.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:38:39):**  And he also sells 20,000 pounds, pounds being the British currency, not the weight unit,  
**[0:38:46-0:38:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:38:46):**  of harvest locally, mainly in salad leaves.  
**[0:38:49-0:38:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:38:49):**  And many vegetables are served on the courses at home acres, his farm.  
**[0:38:54-0:38:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:38:54):**  Charles methods are easy to understand and work on small areas as well as large ones.  
**[0:38:59-0:39:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:38:59):**  He has written 10 books and an annual calendar of sewing dates.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:39:02):**  He runs a YouTube channel and writes for National Garden magazines and gives talks and courses  
**[0:39:07-0:39:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:39:07):**  at home and abroad.  
**[0:39:09-0:39:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:39:09):**  Charles, have we got you here now?  
**[0:39:11-0:39:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:39:11):**  All right, I'll leave that in Nick's hands for just a minute.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:39:14):**  Let's continue with what we were talking about, materials for compost, because we've mentioned  
**[0:39:18-0:39:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:39:18):**  the main ingredients, your carbon and your nitrogen sources.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:39:23):**  But there's a lot of talk about other inoculants that can help to accelerate or increase the  
**[0:39:27-0:39:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:39:27):**  diversity of the bacteria or the fungal populations, things like essential microbes, EMs, biochar,  
**[0:39:36-0:39:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:39:36):**  rock dust, and so many others.  
**[0:39:38-0:39:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:39:38):**  Can you talk a little bit about your own experience and the use of those in your own compost production?  
**[0:39:43-0:39:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:39:43):**  Yeah, I don't use any of those things.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:39:51):**  I'm not really a fan of the EM.  
**[0:39:54-0:40:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:39:54):**  Really, if you're wanting to feed microorganisms in a compost pile, you could just use the  
**[0:40:00-0:40:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:40:00):**  same types of things that like I would use for a compost tea.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:40:04):**  So like kelp or fish hydrolysate, maybe a little tiny bit of unsulfured molasses, black  
**[0:40:14-0:40:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:40:14):**  shrub molasses, so mix something up in a watering can and water it down.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:40:19):**  A lot of times what I do is I'll make a compost tea and I'll have extra compost tea, either  
**[0:40:24-0:40:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:40:24):**  full strength or diluted, and I'll dump that onto my compost pile.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:40:29):**  And I've noticed that it breaks down even faster over time.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:40:35):**  So you've got a lot of bacteria and fungi that are floating in the air that, you know,  
**[0:40:42-0:40:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:40:42):**  just by having your compost pile exposed to the air, are going to bring in more microorganisms  
**[0:40:49-0:40:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:40:49):**  to help break things down.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:40:51):**  The best thing, the best suggestion that I can give anybody, I don't know, I didn't think  
**[0:40:58-0:41:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:40:58):**  this right away because it's always my go-to for giving a suggestion, is to get a forest,  
**[0:41:04-0:41:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:41:04):**  what I call a forest soil inoculant, and this is one of the first things that Elaine taught  
**[0:41:08-0:41:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:41:08):**  me that when weeded out at Rodale, go out to your nearest forest or woods.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:41:17):**  If it's a park, you know, you're not supposed to be doing it necessarily, but if you can  
**[0:41:21-0:41:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:41:21):**  go out your back door or know someone that has a woods nearby, go and find some leaves  
**[0:41:27-0:41:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:41:27):**  and look underneath the leaves for some mycelium, which are going to be like white strands on  
**[0:41:33-0:41:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:41:33):**  the leaves or on the sticks or on the surface of the soil.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:41:37):**  This is going to be saprophytic fungi that you know is native and breaks down things  
**[0:41:43-0:41:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:41:43):**  and works in your environment.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:41:45):**  And take some, you know, take a couple handfuls from this area and then go somewhere else  
**[0:41:49-0:41:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:41:49):**  close by in the forest and look for some more, you know, leaves with mycelium.  
**[0:41:54-0:41:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:41:54):**  I'll grab some leaves, I'll grab some sticks.  
**[0:41:57-0:42:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:41:57):**  This, all of these things that we're working with are microscopic, so a lot of this mycelium,  
**[0:42:02-0:42:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:42:02):**  you're not even going to see.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:42:04):**  What you're seeing is a buildup of the mycelium that it's been there so much and overlapped  
**[0:42:08-0:42:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:42:08):**  and overlapped and you're able to see it with your naked eye, but it's come up from the  
**[0:42:12-0:42:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:42:12):**  soil from the forest floor.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:42:14):**  So by grabbing a little bit of this soil, grabbing some leaves, grabbing some sticks,  
**[0:42:18-0:42:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:42:18):**  you're creating an inoculant of native microorganisms, but especially native saprophytic fungi and  
**[0:42:25-0:42:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:42:25):**  saprophytic fungi is what breaks down dead or decaying woody tissue.  
**[0:42:30-0:42:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:42:30):**  So by inoculating your compost pile or whatever it is with this, even a worm bin, you're helping  
**[0:42:37-0:42:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:42:37):**  to add microorganisms that are going to break down woody tissue, especially about work in  
**[0:42:42-0:42:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:42:42):**  your environment and you know that's going to survive in your environment.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:42:46):**  Nice.  
**[0:42:47-0:42:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:42:47):**  I'm going to quickly cut to Charles now.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:42:49):**  Can you hear us all right, Charles?  
**[0:42:50-0:42:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:42:50):**  Yes, I can Oliver.  
**[0:42:52-0:42:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:42:52):**  Sorry for being late.  
**[0:42:53-0:42:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:42:53):**  No problem.  
**[0:42:54-0:42:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:42:54):**  I'm glad that you're here.  
**[0:42:55-0:42:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:42:55):**  It's great for you to join us.  
**[0:42:57-0:43:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:42:57):**  And we were just talking right now about outside inoculants for compost.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:43:02):**  Now I'm pretty familiar with your composting method.  
**[0:43:04-0:43:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:43:04):**  You've got great resources out there and videos on how you do it as well as the materials  
**[0:43:08-0:43:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:43:08):**  that you gather.  
**[0:43:10-0:43:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:43:10):**  And Troy was just talking about the inoculants like saprophytic fungi from samples of soil  
**[0:43:18-0:43:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:43:18):**  from nearby forest that are already established.  
**[0:43:21-0:43:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:43:21):**  Do you use any other inoculants?  
**[0:43:23-0:43:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:43:23):**  Like perhaps biochar or rock dust or really anything else that isn't normally the materials  
**[0:43:30-0:43:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:43:30):**  that you use as the bulk of your compost and seen good results with them?  
**[0:43:36-0:43:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:43:36):**  Kind of.  
**[0:43:37-0:43:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:43:37):**  It's a question a little bit of how you measure results, I feel.  
**[0:43:42-0:43:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:43:42):**  I find it very difficult in quite a general way to assess the effectiveness of many of  
**[0:43:47-0:43:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:43:47):**  the methods I use because I'm doing quite a few different things always.  
**[0:43:51-0:43:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:43:51):**  I want my garden to flourish in the best possible way.  
**[0:43:54-0:43:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:43:54):**  So I'm never going to do just one thing.  
**[0:43:57-0:44:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:43:57):**  And just I'm interested you mentioned rock dust actually there because I've never thought  
**[0:44:00-0:44:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:44:00):**  of it in terms of an inoculant if you like biological quality, but maybe it does.  
**[0:44:05-0:44:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:44:05):**  And I do have it.  
**[0:44:06-0:44:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:44:06):**  That's why I'm interested actually.  
**[0:44:09-0:44:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:44:09):**  Because I feel it does bring something.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:44:10):**  But I would put it more in energy terms.  
**[0:44:15-0:44:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:44:15):**  I get a bit off the scale because it's nothing I could measure.  
**[0:44:20-0:44:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:44:20):**  But I feel there's a lot we can learn from energy gardening like biodynamics and like  
**[0:44:27-0:44:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:44:27):**  all the energy gardening.  
**[0:44:28-0:44:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:44:28):**  Schauberger, you know, going back to some of Schauberger's early discoveries in Austria,  
**[0:44:33-0:44:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:44:33):**  where he found a farmer stirring water and singing.  
**[0:44:37-0:44:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:44:37):**  And his version of his version of the biodynamics which came later, this was in about 1910,  
**[0:44:43-0:44:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:44:43):**  Schauberger found that preceded Steiner's work.  
**[0:44:47-0:44:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:44:47):**  But I think Steiner based his work on this kind of thing.  
**[0:44:49-0:44:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:44:49):**  But basically this guy was energizing the water somehow with his sound.  
**[0:44:54-0:44:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:44:54):**  You know, who does that anymore?  
**[0:44:57-0:44:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:44:57):**  How much do we, or rather, how little do we know about that?  
**[0:44:59-0:45:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:44:59):**  I think there's huge frontiers here of stuff to discover.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:45:03):**  And currently it is quite topical to talk about the biology, which is fantastic because  
**[0:45:07-0:45:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:45:07):**  it wasn't for a long time.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:45:09):**  But I'm actually very interested in the energy, shall we say.  
**[0:45:13-0:45:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:45:13):**  I'm sorry if that sounds vague, by the way.  
**[0:45:15-0:45:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:45:15):**  It's stuff you can't measure really.  
**[0:45:17-0:45:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:45:17):**  No, not at all.  
**[0:45:18-0:45:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:45:18):**  And it is important as we continue to learn more about these frontiers of plant health  
**[0:45:23-0:45:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:45:23):**  and especially soil biology that only just a few years ago were either immeasurable or  
**[0:45:29-0:45:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:45:29):**  we had no idea what we were looking for.  
**[0:45:31-0:45:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:45:31):**  And I think being open minded and creative about the influences on the health of the  
**[0:45:36-0:45:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:45:36):**  biology and the entire ecosystem in our growing environments is really important.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:45:41):**  So I'll throw another question at you.  
**[0:45:43-0:45:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:45:43):**  Since we've covered a lot about composting methods, different types, and what it is you're  
**[0:45:48-0:45:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:45:48):**  looking for, how to analyze its effectiveness with Troy already, can you tell me about in  
**[0:45:56-0:46:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:45:56):**  terms of creating healthy compost for your garden, what are some of the troubleshooting  
**[0:46:02-0:46:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:46:02):**  things that you often work with with your clients or other people that you consult with  
**[0:46:05-0:46:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:46:05):**  or teach that are very common mistakes that you see repeated over and over again that  
**[0:46:10-0:46:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:46:10):**  are easy to avoid?  
**[0:46:12-0:46:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:46:12):**  What are some of the things that you can give us some advice on to avoid those pitfalls?  
**[0:46:18-0:46:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:46:18):**  Probably the biggest one is moisture content, which is so hard again to describe because  
**[0:46:25-0:46:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:46:25):**  it's so variable.  
**[0:46:26-0:46:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:46:26):**  And from my experience, a lot of people get their compost too wet.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:46:31):**  And I actually went on a compost making course about four years ago now with an American  
**[0:46:37-0:46:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:46:37):**  guy, God, I can't remember his name, but his advice was a bit towards a dry climate than  
**[0:46:44-0:46:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:46:44):**  we have here in the UK.  
**[0:46:45-0:46:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:46:45):**  And he was talking about whenever you add something to your compost, he adds some water,  
**[0:46:48-0:46:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:46:48):**  which seemed appropriate to him based on his experience, I guess.  
**[0:46:51-0:46:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:46:51):**  When I tried that, it returned to my fire, it just got too soggy.  
**[0:46:55-0:46:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:46:55):**  And anyway, since then I've added the roof to my compost making area, and that's just  
**[0:46:59-0:47:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:46:59):**  made the world of difference, getting the moisture level right, not too soggy.  
**[0:47:04-0:47:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:47:04):**  It's very rare in the temperate climate, I feel that you need to have water.  
**[0:47:08-0:47:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:47:08):**  And that's partly because every green leaf you add contains moisture already, and that  
**[0:47:12-0:47:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:47:12):**  comes out in the composting process.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:47:15):**  So it's air, I think air is the most common thing that people struggle with, getting enough  
**[0:47:19-0:47:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:47:19):**  air in their compost heap.  
**[0:47:21-0:47:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:47:21):**  But then they come to believe that two mistaken things, one is they believe because they've  
**[0:47:26-0:47:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:47:26):**  been told that air somehow flows in through slatted sites, and I think that's total nonsense.  
**[0:47:31-0:47:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:47:31):**  You know, it doesn't, if you think about it, it doesn't really make sense.  
**[0:47:33-0:47:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:47:33):**  It means your heat was always going to cool down, it's going to dry out, blah, blah, blah.  
**[0:47:37-0:47:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:47:37):**  Solid sites are best, they contain the air and warmth that's already in there.  
**[0:47:42-0:47:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:47:42):**  You get the air level right by adding enough woody matter.  
**[0:47:44-0:47:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:47:44):**  And the woody matter is brilliant for bringing in the fungi that you've already been discussing.  
**[0:47:49-0:47:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:47:49):**  And that's the thing that's made a huge difference to me is adding more wood.  
**[0:47:53-0:47:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:47:53):**  Since I bought a shredder in 2016, and we take green wood from the hedgerows, spare  
**[0:47:59-0:48:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:47:59):**  branches of elder and that kind of thing.  
**[0:48:01-0:48:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:48:01):**  And since doing that, I've noticed a big increase of mushrooms growing in my beds.  
**[0:48:06-0:48:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:48:06):**  And sometimes when we plant our part from actually, we find the soil is almost done  
**[0:48:10-0:48:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:48:10):**  white in places, it's quite dramatic, but plants love it, and they're all growing really well.  
**[0:48:15-0:48:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:48:15):**  So putting more wood in is another thing people are afraid of that, I think a bit, but you  
**[0:48:20-0:48:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:48:20):**  just getting that balance right.  
**[0:48:22-0:48:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:48:22):**  You know, the older I get, the more I realize that composting is an art as well as a science  
**[0:48:26-0:48:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:48:26):**  and takes a lot of practice to get good at.  
**[0:48:29-0:48:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:48:29):**  But one of the other thing I noticed, and it's one of the reasons I was keen to join  
**[0:48:32-0:48:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:48:32):**  this evening is how people's eyes light up when you get them near a compost heap.  
**[0:48:38-0:48:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:48:38):**  And it's a process that draws the imagination of many, many people.  
**[0:48:43-0:48:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:48:43):**  So it's something that is great to talk about.  
**[0:48:46-0:48:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:48:46):**  Awesome.  
**[0:48:47-0:48:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:48:47):**  I'm gonna throw it back to Troy.  
**[0:48:49-0:48:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:48:49):**  Do you have anything to add to that of troubleshooting compost piles and figuring out the things  
**[0:48:54-0:48:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:48:54):**  that most people get wrong and are easy to avoid?  
**[0:48:58-0:49:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:48:58):**  The number one thing that I run across with people is generally a lot of people are trying  
**[0:49:04-0:49:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:49:04):**  to compost food scraps.  
**[0:49:07-0:49:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:49:07):**  And like Charles mentioned, a lot of what he was talking about echoes what I was saying.  
**[0:49:12-0:49:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:49:12):**  But yeah, they're not getting enough brown material in there.  
**[0:49:14-0:49:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:49:14):**  They're adding too much green and not enough brown.  
**[0:49:17-0:49:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:49:17):**  So if you've got some type of food scrap composting that you're doing, or with a worm bin, especially  
**[0:49:26-0:49:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:49:26):**  if you're adding green material in, you want to add just as much brown material, if not  
**[0:49:31-0:49:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:49:31):**  twice as much brown material.  
**[0:49:33-0:49:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:49:33):**  So a one to one ratio or a one to two, green to brown.  
**[0:49:39-0:49:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:49:39):**  Can I add to that as well?  
**[0:49:40-0:49:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:49:40):**  The common misconceptions about...  
**[0:49:43-0:49:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:49:43):**  Is this okay to speak?  
**[0:49:44-0:49:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:49:44):**  Sorry.  
**[0:49:45-0:49:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:49:45):**  Yeah, please.  
**[0:49:46-0:49:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:49:46):**  They've been told, safe until so much faulty information like that you cannot compost,  
**[0:49:51-0:49:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:49:51):**  say roots of perennial weeds.  
**[0:49:53-0:49:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:49:53):**  We compost all of them at the moment.  
**[0:49:55-0:49:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:49:55):**  We're composting huge amounts of bindweed roots, for example.  
**[0:49:59-0:50:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:49:59):**  We compost blighted leaves, late blight on tomato and potato.  
**[0:50:02-0:50:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:50:02):**  It's totally fine to put them in the composting.  
**[0:50:04-0:50:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:50:04):**  People have been made fearful and they're not embracing the full joy of the process.  
**[0:50:08-0:50:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:50:08):**  I feel that you pretty much compost anything.  
**[0:50:11-0:50:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:50:11):**  Yeah, nice.  
**[0:50:12-0:50:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:50:12):**  That gives a little bit of inspiration there.  
**[0:50:16-0:50:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:50:16):**  So before we move into the listener question portion, I want to ask one more question,  
**[0:50:20-0:50:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:50:20):**  which is what is some of the advice that you would give for people who are just starting  
**[0:50:24-0:50:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:50:24):**  out?  
**[0:50:25-0:50:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:50:25):**  And we covered a lot of different types of materials and techniques for composting.  
**[0:50:30-0:50:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:50:30):**  But if you want to have success early on, which is often really key to encouraging people  
**[0:50:35-0:50:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:50:35):**  to dig further in and increase their knowledge and keep trying and experimenting, what would  
**[0:50:40-0:50:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:50:40):**  you recommend that they start by doing to get that early win and continue forward?  
**[0:50:45-0:50:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:50:45):**  Charles?  
**[0:50:46-0:50:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:50:46):**  Okay.  
**[0:50:47-0:50:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:50:47):**  Yeah, start small.  
**[0:50:50-0:50:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:50:50):**  Don't make too big a heap.  
**[0:50:52-0:50:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:50:52):**  You need to accept that you need a lot of material to fill a heap of any size.  
**[0:50:57-0:51:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:50:57):**  And so you're going to score results with a small heap, which will fill reasonably quickly.  
**[0:51:02-0:51:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:51:02):**  It may or may not get hot.  
**[0:51:04-0:51:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:51:04):**  That's a key understanding.  
**[0:51:05-0:51:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:51:05):**  Heat is not vital to make great compost.  
**[0:51:08-0:51:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:51:08):**  That would just happen more quickly if you get it hot.  
**[0:51:10-0:51:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:51:10):**  But you start small and that will get your hand in.  
**[0:51:14-0:51:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:51:14):**  And also don't underestimate how much material you need to make good compost because you  
**[0:51:20-0:51:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:51:20):**  do.  
**[0:51:21-0:51:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:51:21):**  Adding it more quickly with a decent amount will give you a faster and more interesting  
**[0:51:26-0:51:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:51:26):**  result with no doubt about that.  
**[0:51:27-0:51:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:51:27):**  Troy, you want to give your answer to that question?  
**[0:51:32-0:51:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:51:32):**  Sure, yeah.  
**[0:51:34-0:51:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:51:34):**  Did you see that Adrian's on here now?  
**[0:51:35-0:51:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:51:35):**  I did, yes.  
**[0:51:36-0:51:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:51:36):**  Okay.  
**[0:51:37-0:51:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:51:37):**  I'll go to her in just a second.  
**[0:51:40-0:51:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:51:40):**  There's so many.  
**[0:51:42-0:51:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:51:42):**  I would encourage people to get into worm composting.  
**[0:51:48-0:51:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:51:48):**  Other than that, kind of like Charles mentioned a couple minutes ago, making sure that your  
**[0:51:54-0:51:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:51:54):**  moisture is correct.  
**[0:51:57-0:52:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:51:57):**  Really most people that I know that are really just getting into composting are usually doing  
**[0:52:02-0:52:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:52:02):**  something in their backyard where they're mowing their lawn and they're throwing that  
**[0:52:06-0:52:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:52:06):**  in a pile and then raking up their leaves in the autumn and throwing that in a pile.  
**[0:52:10-0:52:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:52:10):**  So really just the two most basic things that work and especially, you know, I'm talking  
**[0:52:17-0:52:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:52:17):**  about microorganisms, is air and water, just like Charles had mentioned.  
**[0:52:22-0:52:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:52:22):**  So we want to make sure that you're getting air in there sometime, you know, by at least  
**[0:52:26-0:52:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:52:26):**  turning it once a month if it's just kind of a static pile, making sure that it's not  
**[0:52:31-0:52:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:52:31):**  getting too wet by having it just getting rained on or too dry.  
**[0:52:38-0:52:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:52:38):**  Like Charles mentioned, having a roof over the compost pile.  
**[0:52:43-0:52:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:52:43):**  It's great to have things, especially in the summertime or very hot climate, it's really  
**[0:52:47-0:52:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:52:47):**  good to keep things from getting dried out and to make sure and keep them moist.  
**[0:52:51-0:52:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:52:51):**  So yeah, just the two most essential things are air and moisture.  
**[0:52:55-0:53:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:52:55):**  Troy, can I take you up on something there, which is, I don't agree actually that you  
**[0:53:00-0:53:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:53:00):**  need to turn it once a month.  
**[0:53:01-0:53:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:53:01):**  I mean, you kind of threw that one out a bit, but I would say that I wouldn't want to give  
**[0:53:05-0:53:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:53:05):**  anyone the impression that's obligatory because it's something I've come across a lot.  
**[0:53:08-0:53:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:53:08):**  They feel bad if they're not turning their heat.  
**[0:53:11-0:53:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:53:11):**  I always want to make people feel good about it.  
**[0:53:13-0:53:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:53:13):**  And you know, as much as that might give a nice result, it's not obligatory.  
**[0:53:18-0:53:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:53:18):**  I'm sure you didn't mean that.  
**[0:53:20-0:53:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:53:20):**  Yeah, I was just throwing a number out there.  
**[0:53:22-0:53:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:53:22):**  I meant, you know, every so often you want to be adding air.  
**[0:53:26-0:53:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:53:26):**  I would say, you know, like if you're checking on it and having a relationship with it, if  
**[0:53:33-0:53:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:53:33):**  you're smelling something funky, then you want to make sure and turn it.  
**[0:53:36-0:53:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:53:36):**  But yeah, Charles is totally correct.  
**[0:53:38-0:53:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:53:38):**  I was just throwing a number out there once a month.  
**[0:53:40-0:53:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:53:40):**  That's not necessarily, you know, like, and that's absolutely correct.  
**[0:53:45-0:53:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:53:45):**  Like I don't want to discourage anyone from feeling guilty about their compost pile.  
**[0:53:49-0:53:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:53:49):**  Yeah, and you know, they do though.  
**[0:53:50-0:53:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:53:50):**  I don't know.  
**[0:53:51-0:53:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:53:51):**  They, you know, they hate to feel they're doing something wrong.  
**[0:53:54-0:53:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:53:54):**  I find I have to be really careful what I say.  
**[0:53:57-0:54:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:53:57):**  I always try to keep it as simple as possible so they really grasp the simplicity of the  
**[0:54:01-0:54:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:54:01):**  process.  
**[0:54:02-0:54:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:54:02):**  And I find actually one turn is recommended, but I will say, you know, you don't have to  
**[0:54:06-0:54:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:54:06):**  because some people benefit a lot if they don't even manage one turn.  
**[0:54:09-0:54:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:54:09):**  But one turn I feel does give great value.  
**[0:54:13-0:54:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:54:13):**  And I like the phrase, you know, you know, the phrase law of diminishing returns because  
**[0:54:17-0:54:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:54:17):**  I feel that that applies here.  
**[0:54:19-0:54:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:54:19):**  If you turn it more than once, you're not going to get a huge value from that in proportion  
**[0:54:24-0:54:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:54:24):**  to the very first turn that you make.  
**[0:54:26-0:54:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:54:26):**  For us, that makes a huge difference because it improves the quality and evenness and speeds  
**[0:54:31-0:54:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:54:31):**  up the final spreading actually as well.  
**[0:54:32-0:54:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:54:32):**  So we kind of get a return on time invested in the one turn.  
**[0:54:36-0:54:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:54:36):**  So I look at it.  
**[0:54:38-0:54:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:54:38):**  Yeah, I completely agree.  
**[0:54:40-0:54:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:54:40):**  I'm glad that you mentioned that.  
**[0:54:41-0:54:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:54:41):**  But yeah, so generally when I'm making a compost pile, I may be making layers of, you know,  
**[0:54:46-0:54:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:54:46):**  a couple inches of this and a couple inches of that.  
**[0:54:49-0:54:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:54:49):**  And you absolutely need at least one turn to incorporate all that material to get it  
**[0:54:54-0:54:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:54:54):**  touching up against each other.  
**[0:54:55-0:54:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:54:55):**  So you don't want all straw touch everything to each other.  
**[0:54:58-0:55:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:54:58):**  You want straw and leaves and manure and food scraps so that that's kind of what activates  
**[0:55:04-0:55:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:55:04):**  that biology and gets it going.  
**[0:55:07-0:55:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:55:07):**  Like Charles was mentioning, for a more rapid breakdown.  
**[0:55:14-0:55:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:55:14):**  There you have it.  
**[0:55:15-0:55:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:55:15):**  As great as it is to include multiple experience perspectives on the topics that we covered  
**[0:55:19-0:55:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:55:19):**  in this panel, it's impossible to include the full range of opinions and viewpoints  
**[0:55:23-0:55:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:55:23):**  out there.  
**[0:55:24-0:55:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:55:24):**  And that's why I'm inviting you to join the growing community building regenerative skills

**[0:56:01-0:56:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:56:01):**  Are you doubtful that you are achieving the levels of fungal and bacterial life that you're  
**[0:56:05-0:56:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:56:05):**  hoping for?  
**[0:56:06-0:56:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:56:06):**  Now though I've done many interviews on soil health and composting methods in the past,  
**[0:56:11-0:56:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:56:11):**  it's something that I'll continue to dig into and learn more about because of just how important  
**[0:56:15-0:56:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-make-and-analyse-high-quality-compost-expert-panel-8/#t=0:56:15):**  it is to the restoration of our soil and the holistic health of the entire farm ecology.

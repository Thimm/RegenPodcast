### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 19 Jun 2020 08:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:00:09):**  You're in the right place for all things regenerative living, ecological restoration,  
**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:00:14):**  permaculture and natural building.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:00:16):**  I'm your host Oliver Gaucher.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:00:18):**  In this show, it's my job to interview leaders, innovators and rebels on the cutting edge  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:00:22):**  of their fields as we look for solutions to our generation's most urgent challenges  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:00:27):**  and share these techniques and information so that you can join us in creating a healthy  
**[0:00:31-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:00:31):**  and abundant world for everyone.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:00:33):**  So let's get started.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:00:41):**  Without a doubt, the most important mission of our lifetimes will be regenerating this  
**[0:00:44-0:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:00:44):**  planet and creating a new culture based on care and stewardship for all life.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:00:50):**  But it can be hard to know where to start.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:00:52):**  After more than 150 episodes of speaking to leaders and innovators in the regenerative  
**[0:00:57-0:01:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:00:57):**  fields around the world, and working with clients and organizations to help them reach  
**[0:01:01-0:01:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:01:01):**  their regenerative goals, I've compiled many lists of essential skills and steps that  
**[0:01:06-0:01:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:01:06):**  anyone can take today to begin their journey towards a brighter future for themselves,  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:01:10):**  their families and communities, and for the ecosystems that support them.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:01:14):**  Every Monday, to get your week started off right, I'll send you a new regenerative  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:01:18):**  skill that you can develop and expand on in your own life right away.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:01:22):**  What's more is that I'm creating a community of skill builders like you who are sharing  
**[0:01:26-0:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:01:26):**  their results and stories of success to inspire you towards greater action.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:01:31):**  You can sign up right now in the show notes for this episode or on the homepage at AbundantEdge.com.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:01:37):**  Start your week off right by building your skills for a regenerative future.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:01:41):**  Alright hey everybody, welcome back to another episode in the ongoing series on regenerative  
**[0:01:47-0:01:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:01:47):**  agriculture.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:01:49):**  Up until now I've spoken with growers and producers on the cutting edge of profitable,  
**[0:01:53-0:01:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:01:53):**  regenerative land-based enterprises and management techniques in rural areas.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:01:58):**  But there's also a growing movement to produce food closer to where the heaviest concentration  
**[0:02:02-0:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:02:02):**  of people are, and that's in cities.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:02:05):**  While the basics of growing food are fairly universal, there are a lot of unique challenges  
**[0:02:09-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:02:09):**  that farmers in the city face that just aren't present in rural or even suburban areas.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:02:15):**  And to get an experience point of view on urban farming, I reached out to Michael Abelman  
**[0:02:19-0:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:02:19):**  to learn more.

**[0:04:03-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:04:03):**  Hey Michael, thanks so much for taking the time to be on the podcast today.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:04:06):**  How you doing?  
**[0:04:07-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:04:07):**  Good, great, Oliver, thanks for having me.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:04:09):**  Hey, it's my pleasure.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:04:10):**  Now look, I've got so many things that I'd love to ask you about, and the world of urban  
**[0:04:15-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:04:15):**  farming is quite deep, so what do you say we just jump into the questions?  
**[0:04:19-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:04:19):**  Sounds great.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:04:20):**  Alright, so to get us started off, could you tell us a little bit about your personal background  
**[0:04:24-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:04:24):**  and how you got started in urban farming, because when you got started, this was really  
**[0:04:29-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:04:29):**  kind of an unknown concept to a lot of people.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:04:32):**  Yeah, I was farming in California and delivering once a week doing a farmer's market in Santa  
**[0:04:41-0:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:04:41):**  Monica in Los Angeles, and along the way I would visit some of the neighborhoods in Los  
**[0:04:48-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:04:48):**  Angeles, in particular a neighborhood called Watts, and I noticed that there were a number  
**[0:04:57-0:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:04:57):**  of things that occurred to me in that neighborhood, first abandoned lots, there were throngs of  
**[0:05:03-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:05:03):**  people without work, and there was virtually no access to fresh food.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:05:08):**  The supermarkets had left, the only food that was available was what you could get from  
**[0:05:15-0:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:05:15):**  a liquor store or a 7-Eleven.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:05:17):**  So I thought, you know, if we did all these elements together, I thought, well what if  
**[0:05:23-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:05:23):**  we could create viable economic enterprises based on food production, abandoned lots,  
**[0:05:32-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:05:32):**  employing local people and providing fresh food, we would essentially be achieving what  
**[0:05:38-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:05:38):**  my friend Wendell Berry calls solid and addressing a number of issues in one elegant solution.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:05:44):**  And so I formed a non-profit organization which I called the Center for Urban Agriculture,  
**[0:05:51-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:05:51):**  which when I would use those words, urban and agriculture, in the same sentence in the  
**[0:05:56-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:05:56):**  early 1980s, people looked at me quite strangely.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:06:01):**  Couple to me today that there's an international movement around that.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:06:06):**  But we formed that organization and we did our first project on three acres next to the  
**[0:06:14-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:06:14):**  Jordan Downs housing project in Watts, a neighborhood that may be downtown east side where I currently  
**[0:06:22-0:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:06:22):**  work in urban agriculture look like Beverly Hills.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:06:26):**  So we established, we loaded our farm tractors onto a semi-truck and moved them down to this  
**[0:06:39-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:06:39):**  neighborhood in Los Angeles, a neighborhood known for its extreme violence and challenges.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:06:50):**  And we removed, I don't know, it was like 25 tons of trash and rubble, dead animals,  
**[0:06:56-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:06:56):**  and cleaned the site up and began growing production levels of fruits and vegetables.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:07:07):**  And I think that this was a time when I was fairly young and naive and I hadn't really  
**[0:07:16-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:07:16):**  thought deeply about what it really means to help and how we do that well.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:07:24):**  And since discovered what a dangerous thing it is to think you know what other people  
**[0:07:29-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:07:29):**  need.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:07:30):**  And I think that experience in Watts while we were successful agricultists, we had a  
**[0:07:35-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:07:35):**  lot to learn socially.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:07:39):**  And while that project to some degree continues, we in the end had to turn it over to the people  
**[0:07:49-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:07:49):**  who should really have been running it from the beginning.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:07:51):**  That was those who were living in that neighborhood.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:07:54):**  Sure, sure.  
**[0:07:55-0:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:07:55):**  And was that one of the major things that you learned that kind of led to greater success  
**[0:07:59-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:07:59):**  in the other places where you opened farms since then?  
**[0:08:02-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:08:02):**  Well, I think that it's an important thing.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:08:06):**  I mean, I think that, you know, my work in urban agriculture is in a tied to its potential  
**[0:08:15-0:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:08:15):**  impact on communities that are underserved.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:08:20):**  And to really understand and to really dig deeply into one's intentions and achieve is  
**[0:08:33-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:08:33):**  important and to make those projects well-rooted and grounded in the community itself so that,  
**[0:08:40-0:08:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:08:40):**  you know, I'm not the one doing it for someone else, in other words.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:08:46):**  Sure, sure.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:08:47):**  So look, let's start and talk about some of the unique differences that farming in the  
**[0:08:53-0:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:08:53):**  city, opposed to what we're much more familiar with, which is, you know, rural and in some  
**[0:08:59-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:08:59):**  cases suburban farming.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:09:01):**  What are some of the major differences that you need to take into account when shifting  
**[0:09:05-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:09:05):**  environments like that?  
**[0:09:08-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:09:08):**  One of the things, of course, you know, there's a number of elements.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:09:12):**  Space is huge.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:09:13):**  I mean, the value of urban land, especially on the coasts, is so extreme that no land  
**[0:09:19-0:09:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:09:19):**  owner, whether it be the municipal, the city or private landowners, can ever afford to  
**[0:09:27-0:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:09:27):**  buy that land for very long.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:09:30):**  So you have to have a system that addresses that.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:09:33):**  Are you able to move on short notice?  
**[0:09:35-0:09:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:09:35):**  The other issues, of course, are most soil, every urban area in the world are too contaminated  
**[0:09:42-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:09:42):**  to grow in.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:09:43):**  So you have to address that issue.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:09:47):**  And another major challenge is that most urban areas do not have the skill level.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:09:55):**  There are not individuals to have the kind of agricultural production skill that might  
**[0:10:04-0:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:10:04):**  exist in peri-urban or rural areas.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:10:07):**  And my success is in the project that I currently run, Soul Food Street Farms in Vancouver,  
**[0:10:14-0:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:10:14):**  has been that we have, I think, to some degree, those three very significant issues.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:10:22):**  And so when you're coming up with, I guess, a business plan for starting up an enterprise  
**[0:10:27-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:10:27):**  in the city like this, like you said, some of those challenges that you just mentioned,  
**[0:10:33-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:10:33):**  like the high cost of real estate, the lack of maybe farm skilled labor in the area, how  
**[0:10:39-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:10:39):**  do you sort of compensate for those in the business planning stage?  
**[0:10:43-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:10:43):**  Well, to address the physical challenges, for example, of contaminated soil or pavement,  
**[0:10:51-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:10:51):**  which is in every city, and the high land values, we, again, address this issue by solving  
**[0:11:02-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:11:02):**  for designed a box.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:11:07):**  It appears very simple.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:11:09):**  It's had a lot of thinking gone into it that both isolates the growing medium from either  
**[0:11:14-0:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:11:14):**  contaminated soil or pavement, but also allows us to move on short notice.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:11:19):**  It has forklift tabs, it's stackable, nestable, destructible.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:11:26):**  And so that box itself allows us to grow on a production scale without having concerns  
**[0:11:38-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:11:38):**  about food safety, and also allows us to move if a developer needs us to move.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:11:44):**  The skill level is a different thing.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:11:46):**  That's required.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:11:49):**  I think that to some degree, every urban agricultural enterprise, and I use the word  
**[0:11:56-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:11:56):**  agriculture very specifically, I'm not talking about gardening here.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:12:00):**  The farms that we run in Vancouver are far 25 tons of food annually on a few acres of  
**[0:12:07-0:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:12:07):**  pavement.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:12:08):**  They are highly skilled enterprises that are serving restaurants and stores and farmers'  
**[0:12:15-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:12:15):**  markets.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:12:16):**  And so the skill level that is required to do that on that scale and really agricultural  
**[0:12:25-0:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:12:25):**  is often something that might have to be drawn from somewhere else, at least in the development  
**[0:12:32-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:12:32):**  phase.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:12:35):**  And there's a lot of training that is required to get local residents up to speed in order  
**[0:12:42-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:12:42):**  to run and manage those farms.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:12:44):**  To some degree, Oliver, that's why this last book, Farming the City, which was kind of  
**[0:12:54-0:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:12:54):**  on the heels of the book that I wrote about the spiritual underpinnings of the project  
**[0:13:01-0:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:13:01):**  we started in Vancouver, the Urban Agriculture Project.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:13:05):**  Yeah, I really like that section at the end of the book on human capital and resources  
**[0:13:11-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:13:11):**  and how much that plays into these factors.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:13:14):**  So we just talked about a lot of the disadvantages of trying to get established with the farming  
**[0:13:19-0:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:13:19):**  enterprise and agricultural enterprise in the city.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:13:22):**  Let's talk about some of the advantages, some of the ways that it can actually be helpful  
**[0:13:27-0:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:13:27):**  to have access to a market like that so close by.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:13:30):**  Well, yeah, I mean, you know, of course, is that you are not just near but in the heart  
**[0:13:37-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:13:37):**  of a great marketplace.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:13:41):**  You're surrounded by eaters when you're farming the city.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:13:45):**  And as we all know, most food is shipped in to every city in the world is serviced by  
**[0:13:53-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:13:53):**  an armada of beans and ships and trains and trucks that are bringing food in, in a system  
**[0:14:00-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:14:00):**  which is in many ways very precarious and not sustainable.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:14:06):**  I don't ever suggest that we're going to feed our cities entirely from within our cities.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:14:12):**  And I think that's an illusion or illusion.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:14:16):**  I do think that we need to talk about what is the primary benefit of farms that exist  
**[0:14:25-0:14:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:14:25):**  within said a great one in addition to having that market is that is educational.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:14:31):**  I think it's really important for urban dwellers to be able to literally simply participate  
**[0:14:37-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:14:37):**  in food production in the city, because many people have become so disconnected from it.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:14:45):**  I think there are other advantages.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:14:47):**  I mean, as crazy as it sounds, we find that production of food in the city and the way  
**[0:14:53-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:14:53):**  we do it benefits from the urban heat sink.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:14:58):**  You have a bit of a microclimate there.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:15:02):**  Yeah, products are always accelerated and faster and coming to fruition.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:15:11):**  But I do think that education is a really important and modeling is our incredibly important  
**[0:15:21-0:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:15:21):**  pieces of these that urban agriculture can provide.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:15:28):**  In the case of our project in Vancouver, Soul Food Street Farms are now running a fairly  
**[0:15:37-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:15:37):**  substantial orchard.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:15:40):**  And we've noticed that there are ecological services that orchard is bringing habitat  
**[0:15:45-0:15:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:15:45):**  for insects and small animals, birds, the shade that it provides.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:15:58):**  It's the general atmosphere that is created socially, ecologically, otherwise within and  
**[0:16:07-0:16:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:16:07):**  below those trees.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:16:08):**  It's really quite amazing what we've seen.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:16:10):**  All right.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:16:11):**  So let's shift gears here and talk a little bit about how you first go about selecting  
**[0:16:17-0:16:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:16:17):**  the land in the city that might be appropriate to get an enterprise that actually makes money.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:16:24):**  What are some of the key things that you look for and what are some of the things that discount  
**[0:16:28-0:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:16:28):**  the options for you?  
**[0:16:29-0:16:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:16:29):**  Well, one of the things is that on our scale, and I have to continuously repeat this because  
**[0:16:36-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:16:36):**  the first thing that is critically important considering urban agriculture enterprise is  
**[0:16:42-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:16:42):**  to really try to come to terms with what's the point?  
**[0:16:46-0:16:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:16:46):**  What's the purpose?  
**[0:16:47-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:16:47):**  What is your goal?  
**[0:16:48-0:16:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:16:48):**  Is it employment?  
**[0:16:51-0:16:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:16:51):**  Is it education?  
**[0:16:53-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:16:53):**  Is it production of food?  
**[0:16:56-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:16:56):**  Is it a gathering place for the neighborhood?  
**[0:16:58-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:16:58):**  What trying to achieve and in what order of priority because that in a sense determines  
**[0:17:05-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:17:05):**  the land you're looking for and the establishment set up scale of the enterprise.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:17:13):**  In our case, it's been the jobs.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:17:17):**  We are a social enterprise that is established to provide training and employment to individuals  
**[0:17:24-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:17:24):**  who are dealing with long-term addiction, material poverty, and as such the jobs are  
**[0:17:31-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:17:31):**  critical.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:17:32):**  They provide a sense of belonging and purpose and income.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:17:39):**  Our scale, because jobs are important, has to be significant.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:17:44):**  If your scale is significant, then the size of the spaces that we require have got to  
**[0:17:50-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:17:50):**  be a minimum at the very least of half an acre and preferably nowadays we look for more  
**[0:17:57-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:17:57):**  of an acre or larger.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:17:59):**  That's the scale we're looking for for our operation.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:18:03):**  It may not be the scale for every operation.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:18:06):**  That makes it clear there aren't a lot of large plots of land in our coastal cities  
**[0:18:15-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:18:15):**  of that scale.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:18:17):**  And so we have lots, which as it turns out is not a bad thing because any contaminated  
**[0:18:24-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:18:24):**  soil is capped.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:18:25):**  It's easy to work on those parking lots, especially with there is that added heat potential.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:18:32):**  We look for a parking lot or an area that's large enough that is not going to be shaded  
**[0:18:38-0:18:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:18:38):**  by surrounding buildings.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:18:41):**  We try to understand the neighborhood that it's located in.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:18:43):**  Will there be issues with vandalism or theft and how will we address those?  
**[0:18:48-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:18:48):**  Habers like to eat, for example.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:18:51):**  How can we engage the neighborhood in our process?  
**[0:18:55-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:18:55):**  We look at things like access to water, potential contamination from other sources, for example,  
**[0:19:02-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:19:02):**  pollution from traffic in the neighborhood.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:19:08):**  So all of these things, I have a whole list of both challenges and advantages of farming  
**[0:19:16-0:19:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:19:16):**  in the city.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:19:19):**  But all these things have to be taken as kind of a matrix.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:19:25):**  And the matrix has to be viewed through the lens of your ultimate goal.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:19:31):**  Yeah, defining those goals early on is really key.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:19:35):**  And that's just about any enterprise that I've learned from this point.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:19:39):**  Let's talk about now how you decide on what to grow, especially in such reduced spaces  
**[0:19:45-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:19:45):**  and for the specific market within your city.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:19:49):**  Yeah, well, I think in most situations, even on the scale we're operating on, the scale  
**[0:19:56-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:19:56):**  we operate on relative to rural or peri-urban production is quite small.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:20:04):**  And the smaller the scale, the more important every leaf, every root, every fruit becomes  
**[0:20:12-0:20:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:20:12):**  economic viability of that farm.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:20:16):**  And so selecting the products that will create the most value within the smallest amount  
**[0:20:23-0:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:20:23):**  of space is important.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:20:27):**  And so, again, I can't dictate that because it depends on where it is you're farming,  
**[0:20:34-0:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:20:34):**  who your market is, what your skill level is.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:20:40):**  That's really important because certain crops require a lot more skill than others.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:20:47):**  You wouldn't start off growing white asparagus or French melons, for example, as a bee.  
**[0:20:54-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:20:54):**  You'd start off doing maybe greens and radishes and things like that.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:21:00):**  So, again, the principle is what can I produce with my skill level in this small space that's  
**[0:21:09-0:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:21:09):**  going to make the most productive plants and economic sense?  
**[0:21:14-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:21:14):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:21:15):**  There's always that kind of breakdown that you have to go through to assess which are  
**[0:21:21-0:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:21:21):**  going to be worth it, depending on the goals that you set for yourself earlier.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:21:26):**  Now, product marketing is something that you cover really well in this book, and I love  
**[0:21:30-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:21:30):**  the creative solutions that you outline.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:21:34):**  Can you go through a couple of these with me here, starting with farmers markets?  
**[0:21:39-0:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:21:39):**  Because I know this is how you started even before you began with urban farming.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:21:43):**  What are some of the advantages and some of the things to consider if this is going to  
**[0:21:47-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:21:47):**  be one of your major outlets for marketing?  
**[0:21:52-0:22:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:21:52):**  I think, first of all, general principle, and I spend a fair amount of space in this  
**[0:22:02-0:22:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:22:02):**  new book on this subject.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:22:08):**  Most people, when they start in any kind of agricultural enterprise, may sometimes not  
**[0:22:14-0:22:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:22:14):**  realize that products is only the first step.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:22:20):**  You can do that really well or learn to do that really well, but if you have not identified  
**[0:22:25-0:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:22:25):**  where those products are going to be distributed or sold or for what price or how, then you're  
**[0:22:35-0:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:22:35):**  missing a very important in completing the cycle.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:22:39):**  So I like to say that before the first seed is planted, I should know where that product  
**[0:22:44-0:22:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:22:44):**  is actually going to be going.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:22:47):**  A farmer's market is an ideal consideration for an urban farm.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:22:56):**  Obviously the markets are in the natural market.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:23:00):**  It's right there.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:23:01):**  It's easy to enter into on different scales.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:23:07):**  But when I'm planning my crop plan in the late fall or winter and ordering my seeds,  
**[0:23:14-0:23:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:23:14):**  I am pre-visiting my display at the farmer's market in April, May, June, July, August,  
**[0:23:23-0:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:23:23):**  and September.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:23:24):**  I'm actually seeing it in my mind's eye.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:23:27):**  At the moment, I'm actually ordering the seeds.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:23:31):**  And I think this is important because I think that the ability to pre-visualize every step  
**[0:23:38-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:23:38):**  of the way is a great source of both comfort and success.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:23:47):**  And the markets, in my experience, are successful when you have built your product line, your  
**[0:23:59-0:24:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:23:59):**  crop mix, in a way that those products relate to each other and relate to the kinds of man  
**[0:24:07-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:24:07):**  needs, culture, et cetera, of the farmer's markets in which you're going to operate.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:24:17):**  And then as the season progresses and those products come to fruition, each market day,  
**[0:24:29-0:24:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:24:29):**  I actually have designed my stand and how it's going to be laid out in advance of arriving  
**[0:24:36-0:24:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:24:36):**  at the market.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:24:37):**  I know exactly where things are going to go, alternating colors, putting foods together  
**[0:24:42-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:24:42):**  in guilds, the tomatoes and the basil and the garlic in some relationship, helping people  
**[0:24:50-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:24:50):**  make choices by creating relation crops in a sense.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:24:57):**  And then, of course, providing endless samples, offering recipes, engaging, using the farmer's  
**[0:25:09-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:25:09):**  market as almost like theater where you're constantly in motion, bringing the farm and  
**[0:25:22-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:25:22):**  its productivity into people's world by telling stories and explaining how things were grown,  
**[0:25:29-0:25:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:25:29):**  talking about the varieties and where they came from, exposing people to the incredibly  
**[0:25:34-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:25:34):**  rich world of food and how it comes to them.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:25:39):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:25:40):**  There's endless things that you can display and educate just around those.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:25:45):**  Let's talk about the advantage of having a retail place on your site since you're already  
**[0:25:50-0:25:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:25:50):**  in the center or very close to the center of your ideal market there.  
**[0:25:55-0:26:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:25:55):**  How has it worked out for you being able to sell directly to customers from the farm itself?  
**[0:26:00-0:26:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:26:00):**  I think that obviously a private market or a pop-up market at your actual growing site  
**[0:26:10-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:26:10):**  is wonderful for many reasons.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:26:13):**  Certainly the efficiency of it makes a lot of sense.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:26:16):**  People can come from the neighborhood, they can buy the food where they can actually see  
**[0:26:21-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:26:21):**  it growing.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:26:23):**  All these relationships come together, but it takes a lot longer to develop an onsite  
**[0:26:28-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:26:28):**  market or a pop-up market than joining an existing farmer's market where you have a  
**[0:26:35-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:26:35):**  broader customer base, an existing kind of attraction and advertising on the part of  
**[0:26:42-0:26:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:26:42):**  a broader group of people.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:26:46):**  And so that's a little bit more of a long term if you know your security on that site  
**[0:26:52-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:26:52):**  is going to be around for a while, if the neighborhood is already to some degree engaged  
**[0:27:01-0:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:27:01):**  in what you're doing, if you're giving tours, because you won't get the numbers of people  
**[0:27:08-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:27:08):**  that you'll get at a farmer's market.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:27:09):**  However, I do think it's a fabulous thing from the perspective of efficiency and connectivity  
**[0:27:17-0:27:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:27:17):**  and context.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:27:19):**  Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:27:22):**  And let's touch on one more option here that I know a lot of especially market grower types  
**[0:27:26-0:27:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:27:26):**  have experimented with in the past and are doing now, which is CSAs.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:27:31):**  Did you start out doing those with your urban farms or is that something that developed  
**[0:27:36-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:27:36):**  later on?  
**[0:27:38-0:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:27:38):**  I started what is or was, I should say, the longest running CSA on the West Coast back  
**[0:27:47-0:27:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:27:47):**  in the 1980s.  
**[0:27:51-0:28:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:27:51):**  This was a movement that had come to the U.S. from Europe and Japan.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:28:02):**  Robin Van Ann in Massachusetts, I believe, adopted this concept and really spread it  
**[0:28:11-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:28:11):**  around.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:28:13):**  She's no longer with us.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:28:15):**  And I thought, wow, what a great idea.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:28:17):**  What a great way to create a stronger bond and relationship between the growers and eaters.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:28:28):**  And in California, when I was doing it, we had mixed results early on, to be frank.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:28:35):**  People did not want necessarily to have their weekly produce chosen for them based on what  
**[0:28:43-0:28:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:28:43):**  was available at the farm.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:28:46):**  And this is a system on a weekly basis.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:28:49):**  People pay upfront for a year's supply of products.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:28:52):**  They get a weekly box of products that are what's in season.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:28:58):**  They don't have choice.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:29:01):**  They pick up those products and then use whatever is in the box or not.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:29:12):**  And I found that people were not used to this concept.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:29:17):**  It took a while for them to come to terms with it.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:29:21):**  And of course, now this is a big movement all around the world, and the most successful  
**[0:29:30-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:29:30):**  CSAs now are those where people can actually select and what they get.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:29:38):**  Yeah, I could see that kind of going both ways.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:29:41):**  People preferring the selection, but also really the building of connection and I guess  
**[0:29:46-0:29:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:29:46):**  loyalty to those programs, too.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:29:49):**  Just pros and cons to each.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:29:51):**  Now, let's talk a little bit about some of the other marketing tactics that you go over  
**[0:29:55-0:29:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:29:55):**  in the book, such as value-added products.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:29:59):**  What sort of advantages have you found in processing or adding other types of value  
**[0:30:04-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:30:04):**  to the products that you would otherwise sell in their raw form?  
**[0:30:09-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:30:09):**  One of the things that happens on any farm is that there are percentages of every crop  
**[0:30:17-0:30:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:30:17):**  that are not cosmetically perfect or have other issues or not saleable directly, but  
**[0:30:28-0:30:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:30:28):**  in a processed form are quite wonderful.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:30:36):**  Everybody's acutely aware now of the issues around food waste, and there is a fair amount  
**[0:30:41-0:30:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:30:41):**  of waste in quotation marks on farms.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:30:47):**  In the context of most farms, I don't ever consider it to be any waste because whatever  
**[0:30:52-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:30:52):**  is not used ends up back in the compost and returning as part of the fertility.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:31:01):**  When you have put months of work into producing a crop and for whatever reason that crop is  
**[0:31:10-0:31:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:31:10):**  unsaleable, there is already embodied energy built into that product, but you would like  
**[0:31:19-0:31:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:31:19):**  to get some value out of it.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:31:22):**  Strawberries is an example.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:31:25):**  In a particular week, maybe the market is not strong.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:31:29):**  You're left with 40 or 50 cases of strawberries.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:31:35):**  That fruit at that stage that is not saleable at the market or to any wholesaler can be  
**[0:31:43-0:31:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:31:43):**  processed into jam or jelly and probably many other things.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:31:50):**  Could be fruit leather, could be frozen and sold later.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:31:58):**  By doing that, by processing those strawberries, not only have you saved and preserved the  
**[0:32:08-0:32:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:32:08):**  embodied value energy that you've put into that product, but you actually increase that  
**[0:32:13-0:32:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:32:13):**  value by processing it, putting it into a jar, labeling it.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:32:21):**  It now has more value.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:32:22):**  You have added value.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:32:23):**  I think it's a great strategy to stabilize one's market and to allow you to ride through  
**[0:32:31-0:32:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:32:31):**  the ups and downs of either conditions that occur that make for unsaleable product or  
**[0:32:40-0:32:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:32:40):**  saturated markets, etc.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:32:42):**  It allows you to stabilize those perishable items and be able to sell them over a long  
**[0:32:47-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:32:47):**  period of time.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:32:49):**  It adds value to the products that were previously unsaleable.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:32:53):**  Are you at the point with certain products that you expect a certain amount to need to  
**[0:32:59-0:33:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:32:59):**  be processed in this manner or is it really just a reaction to fluctuations in the market  
**[0:33:05-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:33:05):**  or when you can't sell the things at the price or at the quality that you would like to in  
**[0:33:10-0:33:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:33:10):**  their raw form?  
**[0:33:11-0:33:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:33:11):**  Well, we try to do our crop planning in a way that any potential losses are minimized.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:33:26):**  As your skill level improves over the years, your losses go down as well.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:33:33):**  But in any farm situation, no matter how long you've been doing it, how much skill you have,  
**[0:33:38-0:33:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:33:38):**  how well you've planned, the quantity you're growing relative to the market you know is  
**[0:33:44-0:33:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:33:44):**  dependable, you're still going to have, I mean, this is a biological system impacted  
**[0:33:50-0:34:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:33:50):**  by numerous unforeseen, etc., that eventually you're going to have products you can't sell.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:34:03):**  There are farms that are entirely everything they grow being processed, but we try to cut  
**[0:34:11-0:34:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:34:11):**  those you know that potential down to its lowest point.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:34:22):**  We're not geared, at least at Soul Food Street Farms, towards growing specifically for a  
**[0:34:31-0:34:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:34:31):**  processing market, in part because the access to cultural kitchens that is required or someone  
**[0:34:39-0:34:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:34:39):**  to do that processing for you is expensive and not as easy.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:34:45):**  Yeah, that makes sense.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:34:47):**  All right, so moving now to kind of the importance of building relationships with your clients.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:34:54):**  Tell me where the importance of having a story comes into that.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:34:59):**  Well, I think the story is really always important.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:35:03):**  It doesn't matter where you are, urban, rural, what product, you know, putting a face on  
**[0:35:15-0:35:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:35:15):**  the products you grow and making a connection between the people who are going to be eating  
**[0:35:22-0:35:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:35:22):**  them and the farm and the people who are doing the farming, that kind of complex community  
**[0:35:32-0:35:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:35:32):**  of relationships that we once had between the eaters and the farmers is really important.  
**[0:35:44-0:35:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:35:44):**  And there's no better way to do it than by creatively telling your story.  
**[0:35:53-0:35:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:35:53):**  And that can be done in a lot of ways.  
**[0:35:54-0:36:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:35:54):**  It can be done through pictures, through films, through social media, through displays at  
**[0:36:02-0:36:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:36:02):**  your farmers market or through your personal presence at the places where those foods are  
**[0:36:08-0:36:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:36:08):**  being distributed at the farmers market or elsewhere.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:36:12):**  It can be done by bringing people to your farm to give tours or hosting them or other  
**[0:36:18-0:36:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:36:18):**  events.  
**[0:36:20-0:36:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:36:20):**  All these things we've of course been doing for a lot of years and we're always reinventing  
**[0:36:24-0:36:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:36:24):**  ourselves.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:36:27):**  But the story is important.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:36:29):**  Who are you?  
**[0:36:30-0:36:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:36:30):**  Why are you doing this?  
**[0:36:33-0:36:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:36:33):**  You know, who makes up your staff?  
**[0:36:38-0:36:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:36:38):**  Soils like you're working with.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:36:39):**  Why are the strawberries so sweet this week but incredibly small?  
**[0:36:45-0:36:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:36:45):**  You know, all these amazing little subtle details that those of us who are doing the  
**[0:36:56-0:37:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:36:56):**  work of farming, granted to some degree or see on a daily basis, become incredibly rich  
**[0:37:06-0:37:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:37:06):**  components involved with this work.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:37:08):**  And they want to hear about it.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:37:10):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:37:11):**  I mean, from so many people that I've talked to both through this podcast, through my own  
**[0:37:15-0:37:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:37:15):**  life and working on farms and having started one myself in the past, it seems like people  
**[0:37:20-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:37:20):**  really connect not only with the quality of the product, but like you said, the story  
**[0:37:25-0:37:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:37:25):**  behind it, how these people came to produce what they have and hearing from, like you  
**[0:37:32-0:37:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:37:32):**  said, the people who work with these systems every day and see the fluctuations and the  
**[0:37:36-0:37:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:37:36):**  variables and can explain it and can kind of teach at the same time.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:37:41):**  I've always seen that really translate into customer loyalty and a deeper level of connection  
**[0:37:47-0:37:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:37:47):**  that keeps people coming back.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:37:49):**  Now, all of these things that we just talked about kind of factor into how you might start  
**[0:37:55-0:37:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:37:55):**  to price your products.  
**[0:37:57-0:38:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:37:57):**  Can you give me an idea of some of the other factors that you need to consider when coming  
**[0:38:02-0:38:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:38:02):**  at the proper price for what you want to sell, what you're making?  
**[0:38:09-0:38:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:38:09):**  That's a big question.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:38:10):**  I mean, I like to say that pricing, which I believe was your question, is a little bit  
**[0:38:21-0:38:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:38:21):**  of art and a little bit of science and at the same time, neither of both and all of  
**[0:38:32-0:38:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:38:32):**  each.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:38:36):**  It's kind of one of those things that requires almost a weak ability to take into account  
**[0:38:48-0:38:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:38:48):**  a whole complexity of how much production of a particular product is there, how much  
**[0:38:57-0:39:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:38:57):**  production do you have and how much does everybody else have?  
**[0:39:01-0:39:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:39:01):**  What's what you're selling at a particular moment?  
**[0:39:04-0:39:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:39:04):**  Because that can vary even from week to week, depending on conditions.  
**[0:39:09-0:39:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:39:09):**  How much do you have to move at a particular moment?  
**[0:39:16-0:39:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:39:16):**  Where are you selling it and who else is selling into that market?  
**[0:39:23-0:39:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:39:23):**  And on and on.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:39:24):**  And then at a certain point, there is a decision that one has to make that is part of your  
**[0:39:37-0:39:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:39:37):**  self-respect, if you will.  
**[0:39:40-0:39:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:39:40):**  I don't think there's any value in being the cheapest, because when you're the cheapest,  
**[0:39:50-0:39:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:39:50):**  you often are ripping off every link in the chain, all the way down to the land, people  
**[0:39:56-0:39:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:39:56):**  doing the work, etc.  
**[0:39:58-0:40:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:39:58):**  There's also no honor in the most expensive, necessarily, unless I should qualify, unless  
**[0:40:08-0:40:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:40:08):**  everyone around you has the desire to value the work they have done or to properly value  
**[0:40:18-0:40:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:40:18):**  their products and all that has gone into them.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:40:21):**  If it's, for example, a new market, if you're at the farmers market and everyone has just  
**[0:40:28-0:40:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:40:28):**  started, they don't understand those values.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:40:30):**  But there's certainly no honor in the most expensive for the sake of being most expensive.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:40:36):**  I think that you really have to understand what has gone into every aspect of the production  
**[0:40:45-0:40:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:40:45):**  of a particular product.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:40:48):**  And I think that can involve some pretty serious thinking, what we would call an enterprise  
**[0:40:57-0:41:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:40:57):**  budget where you've really looked at every stage, every single piece, the cost of the  
**[0:41:03-0:41:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:41:03):**  seeds and the soil amending and improvement that was required for that crop, how much  
**[0:41:09-0:41:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:41:09):**  labor went into it from the way through the end, a whole range of things.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:41:17):**  And then you have to balance that against what the market will hold and will handle.  
**[0:41:24-0:41:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:41:24):**  And whether you're in a position to where the volume of product you produced can be  
**[0:41:33-0:41:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:41:33):**  held at a certain price.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:41:35):**  Like I say, it's neither art nor science, but it's both.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:41:37):**  It sounds like it's quite a reactionary thing and you need to have your finger on the pulse  
**[0:41:42-0:41:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:41:42):**  of a lot of what's going on in order to put the prices where they should be or how they,  
**[0:41:46-0:41:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:41:46):**  like you said, value every link in that chain to get it there as well.  
**[0:41:50-0:41:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:41:50):**  Now, how do you want to see urban farming grow and evolve in the years to come?  
**[0:41:55-0:41:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:41:55):**  And what are some of the important factors that you think are going to be necessary to  
**[0:41:59-0:42:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:41:59):**  achieving this?  
**[0:42:01-0:42:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:42:01):**  I think the most important thing for me is that all of us have a kind of a realistic  
**[0:42:11-0:42:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:42:11):**  rather than a romantic view of what urban agriculture is and what it can do and where  
**[0:42:18-0:42:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:42:18):**  it fits into the broader food system.  
**[0:42:22-0:42:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:42:22):**  I hear all the time people looking at urban agriculture as I think I might have mentioned  
**[0:42:28-0:42:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:42:28):**  earlier on as somehow that we're going to feed our cities entirely from within our cities.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:42:39):**  And I think that's an unreasonable and romantic idea.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:42:43):**  Not going to happen.  
**[0:42:45-0:42:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:42:45):**  I think a more intelligent conversation is how does urban agriculture fit into a broader  
**[0:42:52-0:43:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:42:52):**  integrated food system that includes rural agriculture, peri-urban and urban?  
**[0:43:00-0:43:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:43:00):**  What is appropriate to grow where and what is the, because of the spatial limitations  
**[0:43:09-0:43:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:43:09):**  and physical limitations of urban agriculture, what is the ultimate and most important role  
**[0:43:20-0:43:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:43:20):**  in the food system?  
**[0:43:23-0:43:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:43:23):**  These are questions I think we need to have in a conversation that involves looking at  
**[0:43:31-0:43:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:43:31):**  the broader system rather than urban agriculture as an isolated piece that I think make for  
**[0:43:39-0:43:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:43:39):**  a healthier set of values and decisions and relationships.  
**[0:43:48-0:43:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:43:48):**  And I also think that we need to, in respect for myself and all my colleagues who have  
**[0:43:55-0:44:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:43:55):**  been a lot of years of their life, in my case 43 years, developing these agricultural skills  
**[0:44:04-0:44:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:44:04):**  that word agriculture lightly.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:44:07):**  A lot of my colleagues roll their eyes when urban agriculture, the word agriculture is  
**[0:44:14-0:44:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:44:14):**  used to describe somebody's yard, garden bed.  
**[0:44:21-0:44:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:44:21):**  In my view, the garden scale growing is incredibly important and may in the end become our salvation  
**[0:44:33-0:44:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:44:33):**  for many reasons.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:44:34):**  It localizes it and it's really where fruits and vegetables should be produced.  
**[0:44:42-0:44:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:44:42):**  At the skill level, to be a farmer and to be operating agriculturally is quite complex  
**[0:44:51-0:44:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:44:51):**  and like any other highly refined profession, usually a minimum of 10 years to really begin  
**[0:44:58-0:45:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:44:58):**  to feel like you're developing some level of mastery.  
**[0:45:04-0:45:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:45:04):**  And so as such, the words is important.  
**[0:45:10-0:45:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:45:10):**  So I encourage people to use the language carefully and respectfully.  
**[0:45:17-0:45:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:45:17):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:45:20-0:45:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:45:20):**  Now before I let you go, can you tell our listeners how they can get in contact with  
**[0:45:23-0:45:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:45:23):**  you and find the book Farm the City as well as all of the other books that you've put  
**[0:45:29-0:45:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:45:29):**  out?  
**[0:45:30-0:45:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:45:30):**  You've been quite prolific.  
**[0:45:31-0:45:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:45:31):**  Well, that's a good question.  
**[0:45:36-0:45:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:45:36):**  I have three different websites that I'm involved with, although I suspect all of them need  
**[0:45:44-0:45:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:45:44):**  to be updated.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:45:46):**  One is the Soul Food Street Farms website, which is by the way, soul food is spelled  
**[0:45:52-0:45:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:45:52):**  S-O-L-E, F-O-O-D, not S-O-U-L.  
**[0:45:59-0:46:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:45:59):**  So that is soulfoodfarms, I believe, S-O-L-E, F-O-O-D, farms.com.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:46:10):**  Our family farm, the rural farm that my wife and I run on Salt Spring Island is called  
**[0:46:18-0:46:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:46:18):**  Foxglove Farm and that's Foxglove, F-O-X-G-L-O-V-E, farm, B-C,.com, B-C,.com.  
**[0:46:28-0:46:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:46:28):**  And then I have a website which addresses more of my teaching and public speaking and  
**[0:46:35-0:46:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:46:35):**  books which is MichaelAbleman.com and that's Michael, M-I-C-H-A-E-L-A-B-L-E-M-A-N.com.  
**[0:46:47-0:46:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:46:47):**  And I'm not going to give out my email.  
**[0:46:52-0:46:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:46:52):**  No, I wouldn't, sorry.  
**[0:46:53-0:46:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:46:53):**  That's a good idea.  
**[0:46:55-0:47:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:46:55):**  Hopefully it looks more diligently they can find it.  
**[0:47:01-0:47:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:47:01):**  But I would really encourage people, the book is called Farm the City.  
**[0:47:05-0:47:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:47:05):**  It's being published by New Society and I would encourage people to check that out as  
**[0:47:11-0:47:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:47:11):**  well as my last book which is as I mentioned kind of the story of the people we work with  
**[0:47:18-0:47:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:47:18):**  and the spiritual story of Soul Food Street Farms called Street Farm, Growing Food Jobs  
**[0:47:22-0:47:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:47:22):**  and Hope on the Urban Frontier and that's available through Chelsea Green.  
**[0:47:28-0:47:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:47:28):**  So I encourage you to, I think both those books are good companions because I think  
**[0:47:33-0:47:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:47:33):**  without the understanding the philosophical underpinnings of a project, it's the physical  
**[0:47:41-0:47:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:47:41):**  how to do that project, it becomes meaningless.  
**[0:47:45-0:47:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:47:45):**  That's all I have to say.  
**[0:47:46-0:47:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:47:46):**  Okay.  
**[0:47:47-0:47:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:47:47):**  No, no, fair enough.

**[0:47:55-0:48:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:47:55):**  Yeah, I mean I've been involved in so many different types of farming ever since I started  
**[0:48:00-0:48:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:48:00):**  working both massive industrial farms and small scale permaculture ones, both working,  
**[0:48:06-0:48:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:48:06):**  designing and managing and I actually learned a whole bunch of things that I didn't know  
**[0:48:11-0:48:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/michael-ableman/#t=0:48:11):**  from this book and I really recommend that people check it out.

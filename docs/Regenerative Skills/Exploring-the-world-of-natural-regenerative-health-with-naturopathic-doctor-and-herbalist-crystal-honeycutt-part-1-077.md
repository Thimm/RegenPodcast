**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:02:10):**  outdated model of consumption and destruction into one of health, stewardship, cooperation

**[0:02:23-0:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:02:23):**  We're looking forward to seeing you here.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:02:27):**  Regenerative living can be a very wide and nuanced topic, especially depending on how  
**[0:02:31-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:02:31):**  broadly you interpret that term.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:02:34):**  So today we'll start on a two-part journey into a tricky and sometimes controversial  
**[0:02:38-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:02:38):**  world of holistic health and what it means to experience regenerative well-being.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:02:43):**  My guest today, Crystal Honeycutt, is an accomplished naturopathic doctor and registered clinical  
**[0:02:49-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:02:49):**  herbalist who has been in private practice for more than 10 years specializing in chronic  
**[0:02:53-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:02:53):**  illness, stress and trauma.  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:02:55):**  Now I've been a client of hers in the past and she's helped me immensely in my recovery  
**[0:02:59-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:02:59):**  from chronic digestive problems and through working with her I've gotten a completely  
**[0:03:03-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:03:03):**  new perspective on just about every aspect of personal health and how closely it relates  
**[0:03:08-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:03:08):**  to emotional and environmental health as well.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:03:12):**  In this first installment of the two-part series, Crystal talks about how her interest  
**[0:03:16-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:03:16):**  in health comes from her own experiences with chronic disease and trauma.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:03:20):**  We start out by exploring the fundamentals of nutrition and how to navigate the minefield  
**[0:03:25-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:03:25):**  of fad diets, nutritional advice and more.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:03:29):**  Crystal helps to guide us through the basic self-reflection and self-diagnosis that it  
**[0:03:33-0:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:03:33):**  takes to make the best dietary decisions for our bodies too.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:03:37):**  In the second episode of this series, we'll explore why you may want to look to your herb  
**[0:03:41-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:03:41):**  garden before heading to the pharmacy, the role that supplementation can play in helping  
**[0:03:45-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:03:45):**  us to recover from disease, what regenerative health means and so much more.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:03:51):**  I hope you get as much out of this conversation as I did and don't miss next week's session  
**[0:03:55-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:03:55):**  for the conclusion as well.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:03:57):**  Now I'll hand things over to Crystal.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:04:00):**  Hey Crystal, man, it's been so long since I talked to you.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:04:03):**  How have you been?  
**[0:04:04-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:04:04):**  Oh, I know Oliver really has been too long.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:04:06):**  I'm doing so well right now.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:04:08):**  I can hardly even stand it.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:04:10):**  It's it's life is so sweet.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:04:12):**  It almost freaks me out.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:04:15):**  That is fantastic.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:04:16):**  I'm so glad to hear that.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:04:17):**  Look, even though it's been a while since we've talked, you've been a huge influence  
**[0:04:21-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:04:21):**  on my progression through health and nutrition over the last year since we first started  
**[0:04:26-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:04:26):**  chatting and there's a ton of more questions that I would love to ask you for the benefit  
**[0:04:30-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:04:30):**  of our listeners.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:04:31):**  So what do you say we just jump right on in?  
**[0:04:33-0:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:04:33):**  Please.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:04:34):**  Let's yeah, let's talk.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:04:35):**  Let's do our thing.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:04:36):**  All right.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:04:37):**  So for those people who don't know you, could you give us a little intro, give us some of  
**[0:04:41-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:04:41):**  your certifications and your background and how you got working in the healthcare field.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:04:46):**  Yeah.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:04:47):**  So I'm a traditional naturopathic doctor and registered clinical herbalist.  
**[0:04:52-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:04:52):**  I've been in private practice for 10 years now and I specialize in chronic illness, stress,  
**[0:05:00-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:05:00):**  trauma, and I'm always looking to lay people's quality of life.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:05:04):**  So that's really my passion.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:05:07):**  And gosh, I see, I see everything from the common cold to cancer, to mystery illnesses,  
**[0:05:14-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:05:14):**  to people being super proactive and just wanting to be healthy and stable in their lives.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:05:21):**  And that really encourages me to continue doing this work because I feel like the health  
**[0:05:29-0:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:05:29):**  of the human body is one of our primary access points to the rest of our lives and in discovering  
**[0:05:36-0:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:05:36):**  who we are, working into our passions, promoting world peace, all of those good things, I really  
**[0:05:43-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:05:43):**  believe have to begin with the quality of human health.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:05:48):**  And so I find that healthcare to be enormously enriching for my personal mission, but also  
**[0:05:56-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:05:56):**  I don't know, in the probably even hundreds now of people that I've worked with, I've  
**[0:06:03-0:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:06:03):**  seen these same principles apply again and again and again.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:06:09):**  And I got into holistic medicine through my own healthcare journey.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:06:13):**  I was a super sick kid in the late 80s and early 90s when healthcare was just really  
**[0:06:21-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:06:21):**  beginning to get a sense of what asthma, allergies, and other types of immune, common immune system  
**[0:06:30-0:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:06:30):**  disorders was really about.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:06:32):**  And so I went through the conventional healthcare system and only really had minimum results  
**[0:06:38-0:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:06:38):**  with that.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:06:39):**  I felt pretty sick most of my childhood, which for better or worse made me into a total nerd  
**[0:06:45-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:06:45):**  because I fell in love with books because it was literally so hard for me to be outside  
**[0:06:51-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:06:51):**  because I was allergic to everything.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:06:54):**  And I also had a traumatic background.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:06:57):**  And so I found out later on in my career the strong connection between a history of trauma  
**[0:07:06-0:07:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:07:06):**  and chronic illness and that has really inspired me further in the types of programs and trauma-centric  
**[0:07:14-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:07:14):**  therapies.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:07:15):**  But it wasn't until I started taking a really good multivitamin in college that my health  
**[0:07:25-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:07:25):**  significantly began to turn around.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:07:29):**  And I literally left a full scholarship at a university to pursue medicine, much to the  
**[0:07:36-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:07:36):**  chagrin of my parents.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:07:39):**  I fell in love with medicine and I've been obsessed with it ever since, especially holistic  
**[0:07:44-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:07:44):**  medicine.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:07:45):**  Well, that passion and that personal experience really comes through with the small amount  
**[0:07:50-0:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:07:50):**  of work that you and I have done over the last year.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:07:52):**  But I've also heard you talk about the effects that you've gotten working with people from  
**[0:07:57-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:07:57):**  similar backgrounds because you can relate to them on a lot of those levels.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:08:02):**  Now before we dive really deep into all the questions, I would love to start with the  
**[0:08:06-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:08:06):**  beginning and I think this is where it all originates and definitely one of the things  
**[0:08:11-0:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:08:11):**  that you advocate for and that is nutrition.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:08:14):**  And fortunately, it seems like nutrition is finally getting the attention that it deserves,  
**[0:08:19-0:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:08:19):**  especially in alternative lifestyle circles, but also increasingly in the mainstream.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:08:24):**  And there's all sorts of debates now over things like superfoods, diets, Ayurvedic or  
**[0:08:30-0:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:08:30):**  Chinese medicine, vegans versus vegetarians, organic versus local food and so much more.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:08:37):**  So rather than creating controversy and having you pick sides, could you simply tell us from  
**[0:08:42-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:08:42):**  your experience, what are the most important factors for someone to consider when weighing  
**[0:08:47-0:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:08:47):**  all the options in front of them?  
**[0:08:48-0:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:08:48):**  Because it can be a kind of a nightmare of decisions.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:08:54):**  It really is a total nightmare.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:08:59):**  So nutrition really is at the heart of an empowered healthcare practice.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:09:07):**  I focus on nutrition with my clients in a lot of different ways.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:09:13):**  We certainly utilize therapeutic strategies with diet, but most importantly, I really  
**[0:09:19-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:09:19):**  love to encourage my clients to be educated about their personal relationship with food.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:09:28):**  And by that, I mean to just put all of the fad science to the side and really look at  
**[0:09:39-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:09:39):**  what is your specific relationship with food.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:09:44):**  How does food nourish your body, what kinds of foods feel good in your body, how does  
**[0:09:52-0:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:09:52):**  your relationship with food reflect your ethics and your values and how can you engage with  
**[0:09:59-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:09:59):**  food that is – I'm going to throw that word out there that you have a love-hate relationship  
**[0:10:06-0:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:10:06):**  with, but sustainable and also nourishing to the body, mind and soul.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:10:14):**  So in my practice, there's not one diet or dietary strategy that I promote.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:10:21):**  What I promote is helping my clients find their own relationship with food.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:10:26):**  And sometimes that might mean avoiding foods that trigger food intolerances or just make  
**[0:10:34-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:10:34):**  the body too inflamed.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:10:36):**  That is a real thing.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:10:37):**  And certainly when we're looking at the practices of modern agriculture, we're seeing more and  
**[0:10:43-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:10:43):**  more challenges that people are having eating modern food.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:10:46):**  So that is a very real piece of working with your food therapeutically.  
**[0:10:52-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:10:52):**  But at the same time, having a personal relationship with food can make all the difference in regards  
**[0:11:01-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:11:01):**  to your empowerment as a person with your own healthcare.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:11:07):**  This is the place that I get excited because most of the people I end up working with are  
**[0:11:12-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:11:12):**  really sick and they haven't been able to find the care or support that they need in  
**[0:11:18-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:11:18):**  the conventional healthcare system.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:11:20):**  So they end up at my doorstep.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:11:23):**  And one of the things that happens so commonly within that chronic illness process is the  
**[0:11:29-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:11:29):**  sense of being disempowered.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:11:32):**  And the foods that you choose to eat on a daily basis is truly one of the most significant  
**[0:11:41-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:11:41):**  decisions that you can engage in on a daily basis that positively influences your health.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:11:48):**  So if I'm looking at a client who's suffering from chronic illness and they also have this  
**[0:11:54-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:11:54):**  foundation of feeling very disempowered, helping them to reengage with food is one of the best  
**[0:12:00-0:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:12:00):**  ways that I can help hand them power over their healthcare.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:12:06):**  And that supersedes any diet, any dietary strategy, any research that's out there.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:12:14):**  And nutrition as a scientist is in its infancy and that's part of the reason why it's so  
**[0:12:19-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:12:19):**  challenging, figuring out how to navigate nutrition is because there's still just so  
**[0:12:26-0:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:12:26):**  much that we don't know and it's very hard to study nutrition from a scientific standpoint.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:12:32):**  But if you can begin developing a relationship with food that feels empowering and nourishing  
**[0:12:38-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:12:38):**  to you, then you're ahead of the game.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:12:41):**  Then a person like me can come in and help you tweak that process if you really do need  
**[0:12:46-0:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:12:46):**  some therapeutic suggestions, if you need to look at the ratios of the foods that you're  
**[0:12:53-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:12:53):**  in taking or just increasing your general knowledge of nutrition and nutritional science  
**[0:12:58-0:13:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:12:58):**  in general, that's where I come in.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:13:00):**  But if I can help you develop an intuitive sense of food, then you are well on your way  
**[0:13:10-0:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:13:10):**  to becoming an empowered person.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:13:13):**  That is incredible.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:13:14):**  Now, because of all of these different factors that we talked about earlier, all the different  
**[0:13:19-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:13:19):**  considerations and fad diets and everything like that, instead of getting lost in the  
**[0:13:25-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:13:25):**  clutter and to find a personal relationship with food like you mentioned, what are some  
**[0:13:29-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:13:29):**  of the questions that we should be asking ourselves and some of the indicating factors  
**[0:13:34-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:13:34):**  that can help us make decisions that are correct for ourselves?  
**[0:13:37-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:13:37):**  Oh, question.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:13:39):**  Well, first place to begin is just, I would say literally, stop.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:13:46):**  Whatever you're putting in your mouth right now, just stop and ask yourself, how am I  
**[0:13:51-0:13:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:13:51):**  feeling right now?  
**[0:13:52-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:13:52):**  How is my body feeling?  
**[0:13:54-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:13:54):**  How is my mind feeling?  
**[0:13:55-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:13:55):**  How is my heart feeling?  
**[0:13:57-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:13:57):**  And what is it that I really want to get out of my food?  
**[0:14:03-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:14:03):**  I mean, we think, oh, well, I want nutrition.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:14:05):**  I want that nutritional value.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:14:07):**  I want that energy.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:14:09):**  I want healthy skin.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:14:11):**  I want beautiful hair.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:14:12):**  I want to grow into my fullest potential at the physiological level.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:14:17):**  But you need to ask even more specific questions than that, such as, is this Big Mac really  
**[0:14:23-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:14:23):**  feeding me or is it convenient or do I not feel like I deserve to take an hour out of  
**[0:14:33-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:14:33):**  my workweek to eat a decent meal?  
**[0:14:37-0:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:14:37):**  Or what are my resources?  
**[0:14:39-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:14:39):**  Are my resources right now such that I have a really limited food budget?  
**[0:14:44-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:14:44):**  And how does that impact my health and well-being?  
**[0:14:46-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:14:46):**  I mean, these are all really real considerations for people.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:14:51):**  Yeah, those are really important questions.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:14:53):**  It seems like we're getting to the base of a lot of other issues that may be the stem  
**[0:14:59-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:14:59):**  of issues with food or nutrition.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:15:02):**  We're going a little deeper now.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:15:03):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:15:05):**  It's really, it's so complicated.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:15:08):**  I mean, food is just second to water, right, in keeping us alive outside of oxygen.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:15:15):**  So we have an enormously complicated relationship with food.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:15:22):**  And I think that from my perspective, especially being in botanical medicine, our relationship  
**[0:15:29-0:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:15:29):**  with food isn't just about how food serves us, but also about how we conserve our source.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:15:37):**  We start, you know, we can even get into the dynamics of modern agriculture versus traditional  
**[0:15:45-0:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:15:45):**  agricultural practices, the quality of our soil, the way that we use herbicides and pesticides  
**[0:15:53-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:15:53):**  and how that negatively impacts our health, especially over the long term.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:15:57):**  And this is incredibly dynamic and it really is at the center of our human experience.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:16:06):**  It's not a coincidence that in most traditional medicine systems, the digestive tract is considered  
**[0:16:14-0:16:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:16:14):**  to be the center of the physiological access or the health access.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:16:21):**  So in every traditional medicine system I've ever studied, the relationship that you have  
**[0:16:28-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:16:28):**  with food, and this isn't specific foods, it's the relationship that you have with food  
**[0:16:33-0:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:16:33):**  in general ends up being the fulcrum that helps you to stay balanced in your health  
**[0:16:39-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:16:39):**  and well-being.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:16:40):**  Let me pause there for a second.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:16:42):**  I want to take that in a little bit before I just jump into another question.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:16:46):**  These are some powerful criteria by which we're at this point, we're now analyzing our  
**[0:16:51-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:16:51):**  entire life and how it relates to food is kind of one of those steps that's a little  
**[0:16:57-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:16:57):**  further down.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:16:58):**  If we're not asking the questions that help us to get to the root cause of some of our  
**[0:17:04-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:17:04):**  issues or hang-ups or aversions to food or problems in our diet, then we're not really  
**[0:17:11-0:17:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:17:11):**  causing or affecting a real solution.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:17:14):**  Oh, absolutely.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:17:15):**  Yeah, that's then we get caught up in the nitpicky-ness of whether or not wheat is a  
**[0:17:24-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:17:24):**  food that is nourishing or degrading to the body.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:17:31):**  We can look at that particular issue from every side.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:17:35):**  There is a valid argument for every fraction of that.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:17:41):**  We can get caught up in nitpicking our nutrition to death, especially if we do not have a holistic  
**[0:17:50-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:17:50):**  scope of vision for what health and wellness really is.  
**[0:17:54-0:18:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:17:54):**  So there is a valid argument for every aspect of the wheat or gluten.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:18:05):**  Some of that is valid for an individual person and some of it's not valid for another person.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:18:10):**  However, if we can maintain this large vision of what health and wellness really is, then  
**[0:18:18-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:18:18):**  we might actually put our energy into supporting healthy soils and promoting heritage breeds  
**[0:18:27-0:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:18:27):**  of wheat that have normal amounts of gluten in them and then therefore the gluten is probably  
**[0:18:36-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:18:36):**  altogether.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:18:38):**  There's so many different ways that we can approach our relationship with food and nutrition  
**[0:18:45-0:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:18:45):**  in particular and I think it really is worthwhile having this large scope and becoming educated  
**[0:18:52-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:18:52):**  and informed to be able to maintain that big picture of what's really happening within  
**[0:18:56-0:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:18:56):**  our relationship with food.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:18:58):**  But it all has to begin from an empowered place.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:19:02):**  It can't happen from the perspective of, I feel like crap and somebody told me to stop  
**[0:19:09-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:19:09):**  eating gluten and I stopped eating gluten and I felt better and now I'm a fanatic that  
**[0:19:14-0:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:19:14):**  gluten is E protein designed to cause all of us gastrointestinal stress.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:19:20):**  It's really not that way.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:19:23):**  It's really about balance.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:19:25):**  In fact, holistic medicine is always about balance.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:19:28):**  Yeah, if I'm understanding you correctly, it seems like the mentality that many people  
**[0:19:33-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:19:33):**  criticize modern sort of industrial approach to medicine like you would find in a conventional  
**[0:19:39-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:19:39):**  hospital is much more of an approach where it's reactionary.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:19:44):**  It's responding to some sort of emergency or a symptom and treating it as an isolated  
**[0:19:49-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:19:49):**  event.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:19:50):**  Whereas holistic medicine is trying to take in as much of the whole picture as possible  
**[0:19:55-0:20:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:19:55):**  and rather than cure things on an individual basis or alleviate symptoms when they arise,  
**[0:20:01-0:20:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:20:01):**  we're trying to develop an entire healthy lifestyle here that works as a preventative  
**[0:20:06-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:20:06):**  measure for many of the things that would come up later due to bad habits or disease  
**[0:20:11-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:20:11):**  in the entire lifestyle, not just relating to some minor imbalance here or there.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:20:17):**  Is that correct?  
**[0:20:18-0:20:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:20:18):**  Yes, absolutely.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:20:20):**  From a naturopathic perspective, we're interested in the entire ecology of health and wellness.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:20:27):**  So just like standard permaculture principles, we're looking at the optimal balance between  
**[0:20:34-0:20:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:20:34):**  the interrelated variables that make up our environment or our life or our hopes and dreams.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:20:43):**  We could lump all of that stuff into the same pot.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:20:48):**  It basically comes down to for you as an individual, where is your balance point in your own life?  
**[0:20:59-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:20:59):**  It's not paleo necessarily.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:21:02):**  It's not ketogenic necessarily.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:21:04):**  It's not vegetarianism or veganism or all of those things.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:21:08):**  That might be right for a person as an individual, but it's not the way to live.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:21:16):**  There is not a single way to live.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:21:19):**  If I've learned anything through holistic medicine, that there are no real rules and  
**[0:21:27-0:21:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:21:27):**  that because there are no real rules, we get invited to become co-creators with nature  
**[0:21:35-0:21:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:21:35):**  in order to be a dynamic part of the entire ecosystem, which is life.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:21:42):**  Sure.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:21:43):**  And it seems like all of these things can be true within a time period as well.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:21:47):**  So the diet that you may be following right now may suit you just fine and agree with  
**[0:21:52-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:21:52):**  your disposition and your internal chemistry.  
**[0:21:55-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:21:55):**  But given another 10 or 20 years with many different factors within your life, with perhaps  
**[0:22:00-0:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:22:00):**  access to different types of food and nutrition around you, that could completely change for  
**[0:22:05-0:22:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:22:05):**  you.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:22:06):**  And if I understand you correctly, you need to be open and at least self-aware enough  
**[0:22:10-0:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:22:10):**  to understand when something is serving you or is possibly expired within your personal  
**[0:22:17-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:22:17):**  timeline.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:22:18):**  Exactly.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:22:19):**  You've hit the nail on the head, Oliver.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:22:21):**  It's really about being in a relationship with yourself so that you can navigate your  
**[0:22:28-0:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:22:28):**  changing needs.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:22:30):**  Human beings get sick when they become static, when they become stuck in their viewpoint  
**[0:22:37-0:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:22:37):**  about anything, when they become stuck in their lives.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:22:41):**  People develop illness.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:22:43):**  And it is incredibly important to, one, recognize that human beings are meant to grow.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:22:51):**  We're meant to grow physiologically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:22:58):**  And if we're inhibited in any of those factors, then we can have problems arise at multiple  
**[0:23:08-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:23:08):**  different levels.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:23:10):**  Nutrition is one of those really easy things to see.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:23:14):**  So many times I've had people come into seeing at the clinic and they're leading quote-unquote  
**[0:23:21-0:23:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:23:21):**  really healthy lifestyles.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:23:22):**  I'm actually going to pick on veganism a little bit here.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:23:26):**  I don't mind being controversial.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:23:28):**  That's good.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:23:29):**  I have seen quite a few people come into my office who have led very devoted vegan life  
**[0:23:40-0:23:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:23:40):**  cycles.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:23:41):**  And they're really heartbroken at the fact that they're quite sick and they're not sure  
**[0:23:48-0:23:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:23:48):**  why.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:23:49):**  And one of the first questions I always ask them, are you vegan because of ethical considerations  
**[0:23:57-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:23:57):**  or are you vegan because you read a book somewhere that this was the way that you maintain longevity?  
**[0:24:03-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:24:03):**  And depending on whatever their answer is, is how I proceed in helping them reestablish  
**[0:24:08-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:24:08):**  a balance point.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:24:09):**  But more times than not, the vegans that I worked with are sick because they're chronically  
**[0:24:16-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:24:16):**  malnourished.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:24:18):**  And that may seem like a contradiction, but if we go back to modern agricultural issues,  
**[0:24:26-0:24:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:24:26):**  so much of the common vegetables that we eat and plant-based products that we eat are coming  
**[0:24:34-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:24:34):**  from horrifically depleted and chemicalized soils.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:24:41):**  And then the plants themselves are dependent upon chemical-based nutrition to grow.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:24:49):**  And they're not necessarily even developing the same immune systems that plants normally  
**[0:24:54-0:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:24:54):**  have or that would have in the wild.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:24:58):**  They don't contain a typical amount of core vitamins and minerals that they would normally  
**[0:25:04-0:25:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:25:04):**  have.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:25:05):**  A good example of this is cabbage has about 50% less calcium in it than it had even 100  
**[0:25:15-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:25:15):**  years ago.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:25:16):**  So in my opinion, it is very difficult to maintain quality of life or good quality of  
**[0:25:25-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:25:25):**  health through a vegan diet, not because veganism is wrong, but because the underpinnings, the  
**[0:25:37-0:25:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:25:37):**  core components of plant-based nutrition are chronically deficient.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:25:46):**  And so I get to have a great conversation with these clients about how veganism unfortunately  
**[0:25:52-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:25:52):**  isn't serving them even if it's coming from this ethical place.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:25:57):**  And it's because of modern agricultural practices.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:26:02):**  And if you want to be an advocate for the health and welfare of animals and nature on  
**[0:26:10-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:26:10):**  this planet and you want to practice veganism, you really need to become an advocate for  
**[0:26:18-0:26:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:26:18):**  helping to regenerate our agricultural practices.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:26:22):**  I'm so glad that you mentioned that because I would really like to congratulate vegans  
**[0:26:28-0:26:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:26:28):**  on their ethical stance.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:26:29):**  I totally support that.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:26:31):**  I'm supportive of anyone who takes a stand for the environment, for the welfare of animals.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:26:38):**  I completely agree with all of those things.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:26:41):**  But many of the points that you've already mentioned, I really echo in that the vegan  
**[0:26:46-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:26:46):**  friends that I have are still importing huge amounts of their food from really far away  
**[0:26:51-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:26:51):**  and foods that are grown in a way that does very similar amounts of ecological damage.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:26:58):**  The problem is that the entire food system is broken, not just the meat system, right?  
**[0:27:03-0:27:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:27:03):**  Oh, absolutely.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:27:04):**  Like you mentioned, so many other products are deficient in nutrition that they used  
**[0:27:09-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:27:09):**  to have.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:27:10):**  And this is across the board.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:27:11):**  It's not by any means just the meat industry.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:27:14):**  And again, I really do support that ethic and the dedication that it takes to live that  
**[0:27:20-0:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:27:20):**  way.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:27:21):**  But it also, I think, comes from kind of a poor understanding of ecological regeneration  
**[0:27:27-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:27:27):**  and what is really needed to help the food system bounce back from this complete lack  
**[0:27:32-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:27:32):**  of priorities, really.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:27:36):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:27:38):**  I can echo all of that that you just said.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:27:41):**  And I think that it's challenging, right?  
**[0:27:45-0:27:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:27:45):**  Because we all want to live a life from a strong ethical and moral place.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:27:49):**  I mean, that is what builds our character and it's often what makes our hearts feel  
**[0:27:53-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:27:53):**  full.  
**[0:27:54-0:28:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:27:54):**  But at the same time, if you are sick and depleted, you're not able to really be out  
**[0:28:00-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:28:00):**  there.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:28:01):**  And I think that there are a lot of different ethical standards that you wish to live from  
**[0:28:06-0:28:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:28:06):**  and be healthy.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:28:08):**  But unfortunately, in our modern era, this means supplementation.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:28:12):**  Unfortunately, supplementation is the way that you really do have to live in this modern  
**[0:28:19-0:28:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:28:19):**  era right now.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:28:20):**  And I know that it's frustrating, especially when it takes a lot of time, effort, and resources  
**[0:28:28-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:28:28):**  especially to eat in a healthy way.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:28:30):**  And that is tragic.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:28:33):**  But one of the conditions within all of this as well is that our nutritional needs of our  
**[0:28:39-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:28:39):**  body are different than they were even 150 years ago.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:28:43):**  And one of the main factors that is responsible for that is stress in our modern lifestyle.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:28:50):**  So our need for B vitamins is much higher now than it was, just because our nervous  
**[0:28:59-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:28:59):**  system and the way that our bodies are trying to cope with stress, they specifically need  
**[0:29:06-0:29:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:29:06):**  B vitamins in order to do that.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:29:09):**  You need trace minerals at higher amounts now than you probably needed because the demands  
**[0:29:14-0:29:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:29:14):**  of the body on those particular minerals such as magnesium are higher when you're chronically  
**[0:29:20-0:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:29:20):**  stressed.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:29:21):**  So these are considerations that often the public don't recognize.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:29:28):**  And this is where someone like me can come in and say, wow, you're doing everything right,  
**[0:29:32-0:29:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:29:32):**  but you're sick because you're chronically stressed and your needs are higher than the  
**[0:29:37-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:29:37):**  RDA.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:29:38):**  And we actually need to look at the individual person and not just this kind of hypergeneralization  
**[0:29:46-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:29:46):**  of nutritional needs for the general population.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:29:52):**  It's just not working.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:29:54):**  It's completely not working.  
**[0:29:55-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:29:55):**  Yeah, those are some great points.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:29:57):**  And I know that supplementation is really a hot button issue.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:30:00):**  And it's one of the things that you really recommended to me when we were doing work  
**[0:30:03-0:30:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:30:03):**  together on helping me overcome some of the digestive issues that I had been suffering  
**[0:30:08-0:30:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:30:08):**  from chronically for a long time.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:30:11):**  And you know, it's not to say that I'm entirely out of the woods or entirely cured, but I've  
**[0:30:15-0:30:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:30:15):**  made huge strides, thanks in large part to some of the supplementary recommendations  
**[0:30:20-0:30:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:30:20):**  that you made for me that helped to accelerate the recovery process, which otherwise probably  
**[0:30:25-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:30:25):**  would have taken much longer with simple foods alone.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:30:29):**  Can you talk about when it's necessary to bring supplementation in and when you should  
**[0:30:34-0:30:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:30:34):**  be looking to improve your diet in order to get most of the nutrition that you need?  
**[0:30:40-0:30:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:30:40):**  That's a great question.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:30:43):**  And it's a challenging one because once again, we have to look at every person as an individual.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:30:48):**  However, I will say that I have a standard where I say everybody should be on a whole  
**[0:30:58-0:31:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:30:58):**  food-based multivitamin, multimental, and you should be getting some form of Omega-3s  
**[0:31:04-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:31:04):**  into your diet on a daily basis.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:31:07):**  I happen to prefer fish oils for those Omega-3s, but you can also do it through plant-based  
**[0:31:12-0:31:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:31:12):**  sources as well.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:31:13):**  Those are kind of the core needs that we all have on a regular basis.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:31:20):**  And if you're eating fast food multiple times a week or you just don't have the opportunity  
**[0:31:28-0:31:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:31:28):**  or resources to – or education even, dare I say, to cook healthy meals for you, then  
**[0:31:36-0:31:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:31:36):**  you really are chronically depleted.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:31:39):**  And it is worthwhile investing in some good quality supplementation for that.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:31:45):**  I would say that if you have any type of chronic pain, digestive issues, chronic sleep issues,  
**[0:31:54-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:31:54):**  any strong family history of illness, it would probably be wise for you to have a consultation  
**[0:32:02-0:32:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:32:02):**  with a holistic health practitioner or nutritionist and just get a sense of what your individual  
**[0:32:08-0:32:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:32:08):**  needs are within that.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:32:10):**  Lots of times, chronic headaches and fatigue and pain and weight gain and all those things  
**[0:32:16-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:32:16):**  can easily be corrected through just changes in your diet and nourishing the body.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:32:25):**  I mean really in that dense, valuable nutrition.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:32:31):**  And that was a lot of what we did is we needed to correct some of the malnutrition that was  
**[0:32:37-0:32:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:32:37):**  happening and then we layered on herbal therapies, which is one of my specialties, to help rebalance  
**[0:32:44-0:32:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:32:44):**  out the immune system and other fractions in your body that were really fatigued and  
**[0:32:50-0:32:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:32:50):**  overburdened due to the infection that you initially had had.  
**[0:32:55-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:32:55):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:32:57):**  Now let's do the exact opposite right now.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:33:00):**  We talked about adding extra to help recover from malnutrition, but one of the concepts  
**[0:33:05-0:33:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:33:05):**  that I've been getting a lot out of recently is this idea that you can subtract your way  
**[0:33:09-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:33:09):**  to solutions.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:33:10):**  I think our society really promotes this idea that if there's something not right or out  
**[0:33:16-0:33:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:33:16):**  of balance in your life, the solution is to add more.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:33:20):**  And I've found that not only can this become kind of a way of cluttering different aspects  
**[0:33:25-0:33:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:33:25):**  of your life, it can also be a huge chore when it comes to nutrition and diet because  
**[0:33:31-0:33:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:33:31):**  I was at a point previously where I was, you know, multiple times a day thinking, OK, I  
**[0:33:36-0:33:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:33:36):**  have to take this at this time.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:33:37):**  I need to make sure that I put this in my food.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:33:39):**  And it became really overwhelming.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:33:42):**  And I know that in the case of especially a lot of people who live in contaminated environments,  
**[0:33:46-0:33:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:33:46):**  which is basically anyone in the Western world, your food sources are already largely contaminated  
**[0:33:53-0:33:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:33:53):**  unless you have some really reputable supplier.  
**[0:33:56-0:34:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:33:56):**  Like, for example, a minimalist can declutter their life by getting rid of any unnecessary  
**[0:34:00-0:34:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:34:00):**  stuff or someone can become more productive by eliminating distractions and menial tasks.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:34:05):**  And it seems very popular now for people to remove certain foods, especially like we mentioned  
**[0:34:10-0:34:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:34:10):**  gluten or even whole categories of foods.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:34:13):**  I've heard things like nightshades from their diets in an effort towards better health and  
**[0:34:18-0:34:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:34:18):**  even more ecologically sustainable lifestyles.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:34:21):**  So how would you recommend that somebody try to remove foods and how can they tell what  
**[0:34:26-0:34:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:34:26):**  they took out and if it was causing the problem or not?  
**[0:34:30-0:34:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:34:30):**  Yeah.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:34:31):**  Great, great, great, great, great question.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:34:35):**  So I have a two part answer here.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:34:38):**  Let me let me address the nutritional piece of it first.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:34:42):**  So once again, due to the long term issues within our agricultural practices, it is my  
**[0:34:55-0:35:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:34:55):**  belief and it's a common lay out belief within my field of medicine that many people are  
**[0:35:03-0:35:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:35:03):**  developing inflammatory responses to common foods due to the alterations or within a conventional.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:35:16):**  So sometimes it really is worthwhile at a therapeutic standpoint to remove certain foods  
**[0:35:23-0:35:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:35:23):**  or certain food groups like you were saying nightshade vegetables.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:35:28):**  Nightshades for some people can cause immune responses that are pro-inflammatory and it  
**[0:35:35-0:35:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:35:35):**  often can look like arthritic issues.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:35:40):**  There are other common food groups such as dairy tends to cause inflammatory responses  
**[0:35:49-0:35:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:35:49):**  in most people.  
**[0:35:51-0:36:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:35:51):**  There's only small genetic populations that actually are able to even break down dairy,  
**[0:36:00-0:36:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:36:00):**  let alone be able to thrive off of dairy.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:36:04):**  So dairy is a common food group that I recommend that people look at very critically in their  
**[0:36:13-0:36:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:36:13):**  life and see how that is supporting them and the research, the scientific research actually  
**[0:36:19-0:36:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:36:19):**  backs that up.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:36:21):**  My practice is science based, so all of the things that I end up recommending to my clients  
**[0:36:26-0:36:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:36:26):**  are validated through science.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:36:30):**  So there has been research connecting the intake of milk for children in type 1 diabetes  
**[0:36:40-0:36:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:36:40):**  and that has to do with the way that milk proteins can trigger inflammation in a sensitive  
**[0:36:47-0:36:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:36:47):**  immune system and end up causing autoimmunity for certain types of people.  
**[0:36:52-0:37:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:36:52):**  So there's a difference between eating and being stable in your health versus eating  
**[0:37:02-0:37:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:37:02):**  in a therapeutic fashion.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:37:05):**  I would say more times than not, people would really benefit from simplifying their diets.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:37:11):**  If you're going to take anything out, let it be those rich sauces and these fancy flavors  
**[0:37:19-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:37:19):**  that are coming in and all of that kind of stuff.  
**[0:37:25-0:37:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:37:25):**  Really when it comes down to it, having a small amount of grains, small amounts of especially  
**[0:37:33-0:37:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:37:33):**  meat-based proteins, moderate amounts of healthy fats and lots of vegetables is really the  
**[0:37:40-0:37:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:37:40):**  center of a healthy diet for just about everybody.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:37:45):**  That's really the thing, right?  
**[0:37:46-0:37:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:37:46):**  We just got done talking about how nuanced everybody's personal diet can be, but there  
**[0:37:51-0:37:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:37:51):**  are some broad strokes that can give you kind of a shortcut to making an educated guess  
**[0:37:56-0:37:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:37:56):**  to get you started on the right path, right?  
**[0:37:59-0:38:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:37:59):**  Oh, absolutely.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:38:01):**  And this is becoming the message through nutritional fads, which is really good, is that simplicity  
**[0:38:10-0:38:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:38:10):**  is best and doing whatever you can to recognize which foods are not working for you at that  
**[0:38:17-0:38:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:38:17):**  individual level.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:38:18):**  So a lot of my clients, I lead them through elimination diets where we take out these  
**[0:38:23-0:38:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:38:23):**  kind of big categories of foods for 10 to 20 to six week periods and then slowly reintroduce  
**[0:38:35-0:38:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:38:35):**  them and see how everybody responds to it.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:38:38):**  If you have eliminated gluten for a month and then you go back and you have a piece  
**[0:38:42-0:38:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:38:42):**  of toast and you get a stuffy nose and then later on you develop a headache and then you  
**[0:38:46-0:38:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:38:46):**  feel bloated by the end of the day, we can pretty much blame it on the gluten.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:38:52):**  And a guide will help you to understand why that is, right?  
**[0:38:59-0:39:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:38:59):**  So one of the things is, as I say, okay, well it seems like gluten is causing inflammation  
**[0:39:04-0:39:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:39:04):**  in your body.  
**[0:39:05-0:39:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:39:05):**  Let's talk about the physiology of that.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:39:08):**  Why would gluten be something that's aggravating your system?  
**[0:39:13-0:39:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:39:13):**  Is it because you've got a permeable membrane in your intestine right now that you shouldn't  
**[0:39:19-0:39:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:39:19):**  normally have in your physiology?  
**[0:39:22-0:39:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:39:22):**  Is it because you're genetically sensitive to it?  
**[0:39:25-0:39:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:39:25):**  Is it because you have a virus that is causing something called molecular mimicry?  
**[0:39:29-0:39:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:39:29):**  I mean there are a lot of different reasons why something like gluten can be inflammatory  
**[0:39:35-0:39:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:39:35):**  to the body, but it comes down to do I feel better eating gluten or do I not?  
**[0:39:42-0:39:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:39:42):**  And that's the empowering piece, right?  
**[0:39:45-0:39:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:39:45):**  It always comes back to self-empowerment for me.  
**[0:39:49-0:39:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:39:49):**  If a person knows that they end up getting headaches when they eat gluten, it becomes  
**[0:39:54-0:39:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:39:54):**  their choice of whether or not they're going to engage in that and that choice might  
**[0:39:59-0:40:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:39:59):**  mean getting to enjoy birthday cake on your birthday or it might mean avoiding gluten  
**[0:40:04-0:40:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:40:04):**  altogether because you end up having bloody diarrhea.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:40:09):**  It can be that kind of level of extreme and that's why I'm saying like the empowerment  
**[0:40:17-0:40:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:40:17):**  piece is so important.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:40:18):**  Yes, we should be advocating for healthy grains in our diet, but at the same time, if you  
**[0:40:26-0:40:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:40:26):**  know a food is bothering you, you're no longer ignorant to it and then it becomes a part  
**[0:40:31-0:40:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:40:31):**  of building your integrity with yourself to decide whether or not you're going to choose  
**[0:40:36-0:40:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:40:36):**  to eat those foods.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:40:37):**  Yeah, those are fantastic guidelines and advice for so many things even apart from just nutrition.  
**[0:40:44-0:40:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:40:44):**  Just a little self-diagnosis and awareness often can really help to write you on the  
**[0:40:48-0:40:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:40:48):**  path that you're intending to go on.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:40:50):**  Right, it really does.  
**[0:40:52-0:40:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:40:52):**  Now the second thought that I had when it comes to what can you take away to make your  
**[0:40:57-0:41:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:40:57):**  life better, which I love that idea.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:41:00):**  I've really actually been exploring a lot of minimalism principles myself and the first  
**[0:41:06-0:41:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:41:06):**  thing...  
**[0:41:07-0:41:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:41:07):**  Yeah, I've been applying a lot to the business.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:41:08):**  Nice.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:41:09):**  Yeah.  
**[0:41:10-0:41:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:41:10):**  The first thing that came to mind even before the nutritional piece of things was the fact  
**[0:41:15-0:41:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:41:15):**  that stress kills us.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:41:21):**  Stress is the origin of illness in all of us.  
**[0:41:25-0:41:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:41:25):**  And so when we're looking at what can we do, what are the handful of things that we can  
**[0:41:31-0:41:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:41:31):**  really do that maximizes our health and wellbeing, it's to take a really hard look at what is  
**[0:41:38-0:41:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:41:38):**  causing or contributing to stress in your life and managing that the best of your ability.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:41:44):**  And sometimes that means letting go of toxic relationships.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:41:49):**  Sometimes that means really investing in therapy.  
**[0:41:52-0:41:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:41:52):**  Sometimes that means ditching the sugar in your life or the other types of addictions  
**[0:41:59-0:42:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:41:59):**  that you may have.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:42:01):**  Sometimes it looks like getting rid of your TV and reading books instead.  
**[0:42:05-0:42:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:42:05):**  Sometimes it looks like shutting off all your electronics and making sure to go to bed by  
**[0:42:11-0:42:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:42:11):**  10 o'clock or 11 o'clock at night.  
**[0:42:13-0:42:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:42:13):**  So I really feel like nutrition is something that it's a tool, it's a modality.  
**[0:42:23-0:42:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:42:23):**  We all need it, but it's something that we can manipulate a lot to help us live better  
**[0:42:30-0:42:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:42:30):**  quality of life.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:42:31):**  But when we really look at health, and I like to think of it truly as quality of life because  
**[0:42:39-0:42:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:42:39):**  there are some people that live chronic illness or my clients, but they have a quality of  
**[0:42:44-0:42:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:42:44):**  life that is satisfactory to them.  
**[0:42:47-0:42:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:42:47):**  So the concept of quality of life, I think is a better indicator of health than your  
**[0:42:53-0:42:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:42:53):**  blood pressure.  
**[0:42:54-0:43:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:42:54):**  In fact, quality of life often tends to be the primary ideology of your blood pressure  
**[0:43:02-0:43:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:43:02):**  being high.  
**[0:43:03-0:43:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:43:03):**  Yeah, I can imagine.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:43:05):**  So if you as a person are willing to take a really hard look at what's working for your  
**[0:43:14-0:43:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:43:14):**  life and what isn't and being rather ruthless in your practice of eliminating variables  
**[0:43:26-0:43:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:43:26):**  and situations and qualities that are causing you harm.  
**[0:43:37-0:43:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:43:37):**  I know it's a strong word, but from the perspective of a health practitioner, those things actually  
**[0:43:44-0:43:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:43:44):**  cause harm.  
**[0:43:47-0:43:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:43:47):**  You are ahead of the game.  
**[0:43:49-0:43:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:43:49):**  You could be a total foodie and end up spending lots of resources, time and energy on having  
**[0:43:57-0:44:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:43:57):**  amazing food experiences, and they wouldn't necessarily have the same negative impact  
**[0:44:04-0:44:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:44:04):**  on your health if your stress level is low.  
**[0:44:08-0:44:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:44:08):**  Because if your stress level is high, the way that the body compensates with that is  
**[0:44:16-0:44:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:44:16):**  by literally redirecting your energy.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:44:23):**  It re prioritizes where your energy goes when you're stressed out.  
**[0:44:27-0:44:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:44:27):**  It essentially puts you in a survival mode, doesn't it?  
**[0:44:31-0:44:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:44:31):**  Kind of a flight or flight response.  
**[0:44:33-0:44:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:44:33):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:44:34):**  Yeah, it's a survival mode, but even deeper than fight or flight, you end up going into  
**[0:44:41-0:44:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:44:41):**  this kind of energetic formation.  
**[0:44:45-0:44:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:44:45):**  And so at the pathophysiological level, cortisol, which is an important hormone and it certainly  
**[0:44:53-0:44:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:44:53):**  has a dual nature, but out of balance, cortisol, one of the things that it does is it down  
**[0:44:58-0:45:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:44:58):**  regulates your thyroid function, which basically means it turns your metabolism down.  
**[0:45:04-0:45:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:45:04):**  And sometimes it can make your metabolism seem like it's non-existent.  
**[0:45:10-0:45:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:45:10):**  Cortisol amplifies your resting blood sugar level, which means that people are more prone  
**[0:45:15-0:45:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:45:15):**  to developing something called insulin resistance.  
**[0:45:18-0:45:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:45:18):**  And this makes you gain weight and it makes you tired and it makes you crave carbohydrates  
**[0:45:22-0:45:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:45:22):**  and fats.  
**[0:45:24-0:45:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:45:24):**  And it makes you really stuck in a pattern that's headed towards diabetes if you don't  
**[0:45:29-0:45:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:45:29):**  interrupt that, especially in the modern era.  
**[0:45:33-0:45:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:45:33):**  It influences your circadian rhythm.  
**[0:45:36-0:45:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:45:36):**  And so one of the most common issues within having a chronic stress response is you're  
**[0:45:42-0:45:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:45:42):**  not sleeping well.  
**[0:45:44-0:45:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:45:44):**  Your quality of sleep is poor.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:45:46):**  You might be waking up throughout the night.  
**[0:45:49-0:45:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:45:49):**  It might be hard for you to go to sleep.  
**[0:45:51-0:45:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:45:51):**  But I tell my clients, think about it this way.  
**[0:45:54-0:46:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:45:54):**  If your body and mind are perceiving that you are chronically unsafe because at that  
**[0:46:00-0:46:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:46:00):**  kind of basic animal level, that's what's happening when we're stressed out.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:46:06):**  So if you're perceiving that you're chronically not safe, it doesn't make sense to go into  
**[0:46:12-0:46:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:46:12):**  a deep sleep because you're vulnerable when you sleep.  
**[0:46:17-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:46:17):**  So that's what the chronic stress response does.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:46:21):**  It reprioritizes your energy and it reprioritizes certain physiological functions over others.  
**[0:46:28-0:46:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:46:28):**  And literally, it keeps you in something called sympathetic dominance of the nervous system,  
**[0:46:34-0:46:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:46:34):**  which is the fight or flight.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:46:36):**  And we cannot rest, we cannot digest, and we cannot repair if we're stuck in this sympathetic  
**[0:46:44-0:46:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:46:44):**  dominance response.  
**[0:46:46-0:46:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:46:46):**  So I love the question of what can we take away in order to amplify our quality of life.  
**[0:46:53-0:47:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:46:53):**  And I would say that looking at those stressors and really figuring out how to manage those  
**[0:47:02-0:47:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:47:02):**  stressors whether it's through soul searching, whether it's telling your boss to shove off,  
**[0:47:07-0:47:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:47:07):**  whether it's letting go of toxic relationships, whether it's just taking that vacation all  
**[0:47:12-0:47:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:47:12):**  by yourself where you do nothing but read a book and paint your toenails, that's what  
**[0:47:18-0:47:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:47:18):**  you need to do.  
**[0:47:19-0:47:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:47:19):**  That's what I would prioritize for myself through maybe using supplementation or herbal  
**[0:47:25-0:47:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:47:25):**  therapies or superfoods to help augment your health or to help literally you recover state.  
**[0:47:32-0:47:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:47:32):**  In holistic medicine, we call that being depleted and it can be depleted in a lot of different  
**[0:47:38-0:47:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:47:38):**  levels of the being but ultimately you are from being in that state.  
**[0:47:43-0:47:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:47:43):**  And so sometimes supplementation is not necessarily addressing malnutrition as it is helping  
**[0:47:50-0:47:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:47:50):**  to restore the normal function of your endocrine system, your immune system, your circadian  
**[0:47:57-0:48:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:47:57):**  rhythm and your digestive processes, all of that because they get significantly impaired  
**[0:48:04-0:48:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:48:04):**  through the chronic stress response.  
**[0:48:06-0:48:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:48:06):**  All right, I hate to cut this short but there's more than 40 minutes left in this interview  
**[0:48:10-0:48:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:48:10):**  and I thought it'd be better to split this into a two-part series.  
**[0:48:13-0:48:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:48:13):**  Part two will be released next Friday when Crystal will talk in depth about herbal medicine,  
**[0:48:18-0:48:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:48:18):**  what regenerative health really means and how you can go beyond the standard to reach  
**[0:48:22-0:48:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:48:22):**  superhuman vitality.  
**[0:48:24-0:48:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-honeycutt/#t=0:48:24):**  So we'll see you again in one week.

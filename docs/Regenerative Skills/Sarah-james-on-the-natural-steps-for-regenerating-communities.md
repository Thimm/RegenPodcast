**[0:00:08-0:00:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:00:08):**  an abundant and connected future.  
**[0:00:10-0:00:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:00:10):**  I'm your host, Oliver Gautier.  
**[0:00:15-0:00:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:00:15):**  If you're enjoying the ideas and inspiration from the wide variety of guests and their  
**[0:00:19-0:00:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:00:19):**  experiences from the last five seasons of this podcast, just know that the best way  
**[0:00:23-0:00:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:00:23):**  to take the next step and deepen your knowledge in order to apply the skills and learning  
**[0:00:28-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:00:28):**  to regenerate your world is to read a book.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:00:31):**  New Society Publishers' vision is to provide the world with fundamental tools to help build  
**[0:00:36-0:00:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:00:36):**  a just and ecologically sustainable society, and many of the guests that I've interviewed  
**[0:00:41-0:00:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:00:41):**  here on the show are authors published by them.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:00:44):**  You can find all of their work in ebook, audiobook, and classic paperback at newsociety.org.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:00:53):**  Hey everybody and welcome back!  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:00:54):**  In today's episode, I'm going to bring us back to an aspect of strengthening community  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:00:59):**  that I first began to explore in this series with David Holmgren and Charles Morone.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:01:04):**  Back then, we looked deeply into how suburbs and towns can work at a foundational level  
**[0:01:08-0:01:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:01:08):**  to regenerate their communities through civic planning and collaboration through each level  
**[0:01:13-0:01:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:01:13):**  of local government.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:01:15):**  In today's episode, I spoke to Sarah James, the co-author of the book The Natural Step  
**[0:01:20-0:01:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:01:20):**  for Communities, which provides inspiring examples of communities that have made dramatic  
**[0:01:24-0:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:01:24):**  changes towards sustainability, and explains how others can emulate their success.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:01:30):**  Sarah is the principal of a city and town planning consulting firm specializing in participatory  
**[0:01:35-0:01:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:01:35):**  planning methods.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:01:36):**  She co-authored the American Planning Association's Planning for Sustainability Policy Guide,  
**[0:01:42-0:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:01:42):**  and has published articles and given workshops throughout the United States.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:01:46):**  In this interview, Sarah breaks down the Natural Step framework designed to guide changemakers  
**[0:01:51-0:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:01:51):**  through the process of coordinating positive change through many different aspects of their  
**[0:01:56-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:01:56):**  community.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:01:57):**  She recounts the inspiration that she found in the eco-municipalities in Sweden that she  
**[0:02:02-0:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:02:02):**  visited and the examples that prove that sustainable towns are possible.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:02:06):**  We also navigate the obstacles that you are likely to face in the change-making process,  
**[0:02:11-0:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:02:11):**  as well as strategies that have been shown to work.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:02:14):**  We also go into the mindset of successful sustainability leaders, advice for aspiring  
**[0:02:18-0:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:02:18):**  changemakers, some of Sarah's own learnings while teaching these steps, and much more.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:02:23):**  So, if you've been following along since the beginning of this series, you'll undoubtedly  
**[0:02:27-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:02:27):**  be picking up on many recurring patterns in the advice and success examples from many  
**[0:02:32-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:02:32):**  of these interviews.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:02:34):**  And this session with Sarah is a wonderful reinforcement of these important learnings.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:02:38):**  So with that said, I'll hand things over now to Sarah James.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:02:42):**  Sarah, look, it's a pleasure to have you here.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:02:46):**  It's great to finally connect.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:02:47):**  I know it's taken a little while to schedule this properly, but I am interested in knowing  
**[0:02:52-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:02:52):**  how you first got started with working with communities and creating solutions for their  
**[0:02:58-0:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:02:58):**  development.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:02:59):**  Right.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:03:00):**  Well, I am a city planner by education and trade.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:03:07):**  So I've been working in that area for many years, and in the 1990s started to get interested  
**[0:03:15-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:03:15):**  in sustainability and in particular what this meant for planners in communities.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:03:23):**  And I heard of these remarkable communities in Sweden that sounded like they were just  
**[0:03:30-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:03:30):**  way ahead of the curve.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:03:33):**  So in 2001, I went on a tour of some of them, and I couldn't believe what I was seeing.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:03:42):**  They were so far ahead of anywhere in this country.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:03:47):**  And so I came back to this country thinking, well, probably the best thing I could do is  
**[0:03:53-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:03:53):**  to let people know what they're doing over there.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:03:56):**  So I emailed the tour leader who happened to be a fellow planner named Torbjorn Lottie,  
**[0:04:05-0:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:04:05):**  who founded the Swedish Sheikah municipality movement.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:04:08):**  And I said, do you want to write a book about all this?  
**[0:04:11-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:04:11):**  And he said, sure, why not?  
**[0:04:13-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:04:13):**  So we wrote the book.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:04:16):**  And that's what kind of got us started in this.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:04:21):**  So we then we did a book tour in 2004, I think, and quite a few communities got excited about  
**[0:04:30-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:04:30):**  this process and idea and decided they wanted to do it themselves.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:04:36):**  So since then, I would say about 30 to 35 communities in the United States have followed  
**[0:04:42-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:04:42):**  this particular path to becoming a sustainable community.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:04:46):**  Okay, so I would love to know more about these examples from Sweden.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:04:51):**  What were some of the aspects of them that stood out to you and inspired you to write  
**[0:04:55-0:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:04:55):**  the book?  
**[0:04:56-0:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:04:56):**  Oh, so many in such, well, first of all, they're really, they've been working towards sustainable  
**[0:05:03-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:05:03):**  change in a broad range of issue areas.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:05:06):**  And I think this is one of the characteristics of becoming municipalities is they work broadly  
**[0:05:11-0:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:05:11):**  to change rather than working in a few separate sustainable development projects, what we  
**[0:05:19-0:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:05:19):**  often call the silo approach to sustainable development.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:05:24):**  Having said that, just in particular, well, for example, the city of Umeå in the north  
**[0:05:29-0:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:05:29):**  of Sweden, population of about 100,000.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:05:35):**  They for almost two decades have been heating and powering their city almost entirely from  
**[0:05:44-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:05:44):**  the city's own solid waste stream.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:05:48):**  And one of the other things they've done is they helped to develop an industrial park  
**[0:05:54-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:05:54):**  that's called Green Zone, where it's one of the earliest examples of circular development,  
**[0:06:01-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:06:01):**  circular construction.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:06:02):**  They were doing it long before that term was even in use.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:06:05):**  So they, all their power comes from renewable energy.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:06:10):**  They've reduced their power and heating needs by 60% in the first place.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:06:16):**  Their fresh water needs by another 60%.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:06:21):**  They recycle 100% of their stormwater onsite.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:06:27):**  For example, one of the things they do is they clean and filter the stormwater for an  
**[0:06:33-0:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:06:33):**  onsite carwash.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:06:36):**  That's one of the things they've done.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:06:39):**  In their building, they've reduced, largely reduced their use of virgin materials.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:06:48):**  They've constructed all the buildings so that they can be disassembled and their parts recycled.  
**[0:06:54-0:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:06:54):**  99% of the building, building materials are recyclable.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:07:00):**  So that's just one example of the amazing things that these cities are doing and towns.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:07:08):**  And since you published your findings over there and the examples that you just mentioned,  
**[0:07:13-0:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:07:13):**  have you gotten the types of criticism that I always hear from other places, which is,  
**[0:07:17-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:07:17):**  oh, that's wonderful, it works over there, but there's no way that we could make it happen  
**[0:07:21-0:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:07:21):**  here.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:07:22):**  Is it mostly an issue of upfront investment or not seeing how it's going to pay off in  
**[0:07:27-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:07:27):**  the long term?  
**[0:07:29-0:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:07:29):**  What sort of criticisms have you found?  
**[0:07:31-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:07:31):**  We certainly did hear that when the book came out and before anything got started here,  
**[0:07:36-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:07:36):**  but since 35 communities have gone this path over there, you can't say that anymore because  
**[0:07:45-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:07:45):**  it's clearly, and it's also worked, there are eco-missipalities now around the world.  
**[0:07:54-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:07:54):**  So the evidence is pretty clear that it's not just because it's Sweden.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:08:00):**  Sweden certainly led the way with its examples, but we have found that it's a process that  
**[0:08:08-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:08:08):**  works anywhere.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:08:10):**  One of the questions you said you wanted to talk about is what I've learned throughout  
**[0:08:15-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:08:15):**  this process, and one of the things that I have learned is that the process of becoming  
**[0:08:22-0:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:08:22):**  an eco-missipality, which is different than any other path towards becoming a sustainable  
**[0:08:28-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:08:28):**  community that I have encountered, what I've learned is that this process, the principles  
**[0:08:35-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:08:35):**  involved, sustainability and the process, work almost anywhere in a broad range of types  
**[0:08:44-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:08:44):**  of communities, different geographies, different income levels, sizes, and that has been one  
**[0:08:51-0:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:08:51):**  of the most rewarding and exciting things that I have learned in this process.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:08:59):**  So let's bring this all together now and talk about the book, The Natural Step for Communities,  
**[0:09:05-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:09:05):**  in which you give an overview of the natural step framework that you helped to put together.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:09:10):**  Can you tell me what that is and what it's used for?  
**[0:09:12-0:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:09:12):**  Yes, it's a combination of using four sustainability principles, which we've come to call the eco-missipality  
**[0:09:22-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:09:22):**  principles, coupled with a process model.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:09:29):**  And the other thing that sets it apart, this is what sets it apart in my mind from all  
**[0:09:34-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:09:34):**  the other different approaches, is that it takes a systems approach to community change  
**[0:09:43-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:09:43):**  and to sustainable development.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:09:44):**  Again, not the silo, the project by project approach, but this is what makes it different.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:09:51):**  This is the main characteristic of the eco-missipality model.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:09:57):**  So what we do is we create a process whereby all different sectors in the community are  
**[0:10:09-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:10:09):**  all working basically with the same set of principles.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:10:13):**  There are just four of them.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:10:17):**  And they can be used in almost any level, so that all the different departments of the  
**[0:10:27-0:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:10:27):**  city could be using them, the public facilities, recreation, housing, fiscal affairs, the business  
**[0:10:37-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:10:37):**  sector can use it, the education sector, community households can use it.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:10:44):**  And so what happens if you can create a process whereby all these different community sectors  
**[0:10:51-0:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:10:51):**  are working with these, they're all working in very different areas, and they come up  
**[0:10:58-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:10:58):**  with their own ideas within their own issue area for what needs to be changed, but they're  
**[0:11:05-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:11:05):**  all working in the same direction.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:11:08):**  And this is how a systems approach works.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:11:12):**  So even though the recreation department will come up with a very different set of ideas  
**[0:11:17-0:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:11:17):**  for change using those principles than say the public works department or community groups,  
**[0:11:30-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:11:30):**  they're all going to be working towards the same goal.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:11:33):**  And when you do that in the systematic way, then you really minimize the chance that some  
**[0:11:42-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:11:42):**  people's project ideas are going to conflict with others because they're all, again, they're  
**[0:11:48-0:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:11:48):**  all heading in the same direction.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:11:53):**  And that's why this process has proved so successful.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:11:58):**  And that's also another reason that it can work very fast because you're not waiting  
**[0:12:04-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:12:04):**  when you're putting solar panels on the school, and then maybe next year you're working on  
**[0:12:11-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:12:11):**  green building design guidelines, or you're not doing this, everybody's working on this  
**[0:12:21-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:12:21):**  at the same time.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:12:23):**  So really fast, extensive change can come in a relatively short period of time.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:12:32):**  So that sounds amazing.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:12:33):**  And I know you have examples of this, but it's still hard for me to see how you can  
**[0:12:37-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:12:37):**  get so many different disciplines and different people coming to a consensus and getting on  
**[0:12:42-0:12:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:12:42):**  the same page.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:12:43):**  What does that process look like?  
**[0:12:44-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:12:44):**  How do you initiate those conversations?  
**[0:12:47-0:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:12:47):**  Well it's, again, it's actually pretty simple.  
**[0:12:53-0:13:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:12:53):**  If you can get, hopefully, if local officials are on board with this, and that's an important  
**[0:13:00-0:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:13:00):**  part for sure, what we do is we hold training workshops or community workshops very early  
**[0:13:09-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:13:09):**  in the process to introduce the sustainability principles so everybody knows what they are  
**[0:13:15-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:13:15):**  and how to work with them.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:13:18):**  And we often have a community workshop.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:13:21):**  We work to get as broad a participation of the different types of community interest  
**[0:13:26-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:13:26):**  into that workshop.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:13:28):**  We have other workshops, hopefully concurrently with municipal department heads, and we introduce  
**[0:13:34-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:13:34):**  these principles and we get them going, working right away on action plans.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:13:42):**  Setting the vision, an important part is setting the vision.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:13:45):**  Where do we want to end up?  
**[0:13:46-0:13:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:13:46):**  What would our community or our department look like if we met these four sustainability  
**[0:13:52-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:13:52):**  principles?  
**[0:13:53-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:13:53):**  And that kind of sets what you're trying to work for.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:13:56):**  And then all these different groups try to work on preparing plans for how they're going  
**[0:14:02-0:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:14:02):**  to get there.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:14:04):**  And that's how the broad, you know, everybody's working on this at the same time, ideally.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:14:13):**  And then when they come up with their action plans, then all those different seemingly  
**[0:14:18-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:14:18):**  separate plans get put together in one big sustainability action plan, which is then  
**[0:14:25-0:14:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:14:25):**  hopefully approved by the local officials and then off we go.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:14:31):**  So that's in a nutshell how it can work broadly and quickly.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:14:37):**  So in two parts of that process, you mentioned the need to work with local officials and  
**[0:14:41-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:14:41):**  leadership and that's all well and good if they're on your side from the beginning, but  
**[0:14:46-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:14:46):**  I would imagine you've come across some scenarios where there's some opposition at those levels.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:14:51):**  Do you have some advice or experience in getting people on your side in order to start the  
**[0:14:57-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:14:57):**  ball rolling?  
**[0:14:58-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:14:58):**  Sure.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:14:59):**  Now that's a good question.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:15:00):**  Well, first of all, you know, the term eco-municipality sounds very clunky, but there's actually a  
**[0:15:08-0:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:15:08):**  reason for it, which is that again, and this is our approach, it's very important to get  
**[0:15:18-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:15:18):**  the municipality involved and on board with this process.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:15:21):**  If you don't, then it could be a very laudable local effort or community effort, but it's  
**[0:15:28-0:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:15:28):**  not going to be the same.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:15:31):**  So that's an important one.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:15:34):**  What we have found, you know, in some cases it's been a local official who got this started  
**[0:15:40-0:15:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:15:40):**  in the first place and then they convinced their other city councilors or mayor or selectmen,  
**[0:15:48-0:15:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:15:48):**  whoever it may be.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:15:51):**  In the case where the local officials don't know very much about this process, what we  
**[0:15:57-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:15:57):**  suggest, actually the way that this has gotten going pretty much in almost every case is  
**[0:16:05-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:16:05):**  by finding people who we call fire souls, people with a burning interest in sustainable  
**[0:16:12-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:16:12):**  development and who are willing to work hard to make that happen.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:16:17):**  And all it takes is really two or three, maybe just one or two to get things going.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:16:24):**  But if they have ties to, if they know any of the local officials, and in one case this  
**[0:16:31-0:16:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:16:31):**  happened by going out and playing golf with a city councilor, that's the place to start.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:16:41):**  And if they don't have those relationships, then the likelihood is that they know people  
**[0:16:47-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:16:47):**  who do.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:16:49):**  So that really is the most effective avenue we found for getting local officials involved.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:16:57):**  And the first step is usually if they're willing to find out more about this process, which  
**[0:17:05-0:17:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:17:05):**  can be accomplished by a workshop or a presentation, either done by one of us as an outside consultant  
**[0:17:12-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:17:12):**  or someone within the community who's familiar with it, just explaining what it is and how  
**[0:17:18-0:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:17:18):**  it works, and then asking the local officials for a commitment to go forward.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:17:26):**  And again, in almost all cases, this has involved the local officials, be that city again, city  
**[0:17:35-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:17:35):**  council, mayor, county commissioners, to actually pass a resolution officially adopting the  
**[0:17:42-0:17:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:17:42):**  these eco-missipality principles as official policy.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:17:48):**  And that tells everybody else, including people in the local government, that the local officials  
**[0:17:54-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:17:54):**  mean business.  
**[0:17:55-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:17:55):**  And it lets the community people know that this is serious.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:18:01):**  What they come up with is going to be taken seriously by their elected officials.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:18:07):**  So that's a couple of reasons why that's such an important thing to do fairly early on.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:18:14):**  And so that is a potential obstacle that if it's not in place, can really slow things  
**[0:18:19-0:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:18:19):**  down or prevent people from getting on the same page.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:18:22):**  And I know you've outlined other obstacles for communities working towards change.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:18:28):**  What are some of those hurdles that need to be either looked at from the beginning or  
**[0:18:33-0:18:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:18:33):**  anticipated along the way in order to prevent stoppages?  
**[0:18:37-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:18:37):**  Right.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:18:38):**  I would say the biggest obstacle I've seen is getting stuck in the silo approach.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:18:48):**  You know, either getting so into one or two project areas that you lose sight of the forest  
**[0:18:56-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:18:56):**  through the trees.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:18:57):**  You know, you're all focused on, you know, wastewater management or solar panels on the  
**[0:19:04-0:19:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:19:04):**  school and you lose sight of the fact that what you're trying to do is to change the  
**[0:19:12-0:19:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:19:12):**  whole community, change the broad range of issues in a community to move in a sustainable  
**[0:19:19-0:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:19:19):**  direction.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:19:23):**  And I've seen, you know, or sometimes the people who are interested in farming and eco-missipality  
**[0:19:30-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:19:30):**  are so involved in a particular issue already that that's what they want to focus.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:19:36):**  They say, well, let's start here, you know, and then if it works, we can go on and do  
**[0:19:41-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:19:41):**  other areas.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:19:42):**  Well, it's possible that that could work, but there are risks involved because, again,  
**[0:19:48-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:19:48):**  all the resources and focus and it is a silo approach to get focused on that area and without  
**[0:19:56-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:19:56):**  being able to pay attention to the broad range of issues that involve the broader sectors  
**[0:20:05-0:20:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:20:05):**  of the community.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:20:06):**  So I would say that's probably the biggest pitfall I've seen, just getting stuck in that  
**[0:20:13-0:20:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:20:13):**  way.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:20:14):**  It sounds like instead of going for these big mammoth projects that can definitely move  
**[0:20:18-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:20:18):**  things forward, there need to be a lot of smaller projects in different sectors that  
**[0:20:23-0:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:20:23):**  start to grow and gain community support as they develop.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:20:27):**  Am I getting that right?  
**[0:20:30-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:20:30):**  Yeah, that's pretty accurate.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:20:34):**  But I think it's important to realize that even if there's a particular group really  
**[0:20:40-0:20:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:20:40):**  focused on one area, it's important for them to understand that working in a broader way  
**[0:20:49-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:20:49):**  doesn't preclude them from working on their particular issue.  
**[0:20:53-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:20:53):**  It just allows everybody else to work on their issues concurrently.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:21:00):**  And so, yeah, it doesn't have to.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:21:06):**  And also, when an action plan is developed, there will be scores of initiatives that people  
**[0:21:16-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:21:16):**  want to do, people, different departments and different community members want to do.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:21:24):**  But at some point, the next step after you have all those on the table is to start to  
**[0:21:33-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:21:33):**  prioritize though.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:21:34):**  And anybody who works with the municipality knows you can't do everything at once.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:21:39):**  You have to develop plans over time.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:21:41):**  Well, that's what a capital improvements plan is, which cities do as a matter of course  
**[0:21:46-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:21:46):**  anyway, just to develop a plan where this is what we do in the first three years, this  
**[0:21:51-0:21:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:21:51):**  is what we do in five years, 10 years, and then get that down and get that codified again  
**[0:21:58-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:21:58):**  in an official kind of way.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:22:00):**  And once again, that gives people in the community or people who work with the city confidence  
**[0:22:05-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:22:05):**  that their projects that they've worked so hard and they want so much, they're on the  
**[0:22:12-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:22:12):**  table.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:22:13):**  And it's just a question of getting them done over time.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:22:18):**  I would imagine that's essential for getting full buy-in from the community as well, because  
**[0:22:22-0:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:22:22):**  otherwise people feel like they're starting to be left behind as other initiatives move  
**[0:22:26-0:22:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:22:26):**  forward.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:22:27):**  Oh, I think you've really, I think you've just hit on the crux of why community participation  
**[0:22:32-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:22:32):**  is so important.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:22:36):**  Because if the community isn't in back of this, it's not going to go and they'll be  
**[0:22:42-0:22:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:22:42):**  angry and they'll show up at public meetings and they'll fight it.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:22:45):**  And I've seen this ever since I began as a planner.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:22:51):**  I couldn't understand why the planners would work on these great plans and people would  
**[0:22:56-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:22:56):**  come out and be angry about it or would end up on the shelf and not get done.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:23:02):**  Well, in almost all cases, it was because community people were not involved from the  
**[0:23:08-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:23:08):**  beginning in creating it.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:23:11):**  And that is the key to success is involving people from the beginning.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:23:19):**  And this is, you know, this is when local officials first hear about this part of the  
**[0:23:26-0:23:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:23:26):**  process, they often feel very threatened.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:23:29):**  Well, you know, what about what we want to do?  
**[0:23:32-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:23:32):**  We can't, and what if the community comes up with something really outlandish and here  
**[0:23:37-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:23:37):**  we've said we're open to it.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:23:39):**  Well, you know, well, first of all, that almost that rarely if ever happens.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:23:46):**  It's understandable.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:23:47):**  Of course they feel threatened.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:23:49):**  But when they, when I think when they come to understand that, you know, that what the  
**[0:23:57-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:23:57):**  community wants, you know, needs to be considered, you know, it doesn't mean they will, they'll  
**[0:24:03-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:24:03):**  have the final say.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:24:05):**  They're the ones who officially have to approve the plan.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:24:09):**  So it's not like they're totally giving up control here.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:24:12):**  But I think when they can come to understand that the chances of ultimate success of what  
**[0:24:17-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:24:17):**  they want and the community want is enhanced by this.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:24:23):**  They'll usually accept it.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:24:28):**  And so, and the other piece of this is, again, I don't think I've ever seen a process where  
**[0:24:38-0:24:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:24:38):**  when you get through it, what the community wants for the future, their future and what  
**[0:24:42-0:24:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:24:42):**  the local officials want for their future is radically different.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:24:46):**  They're almost always the same, you know, or at least similar.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:24:51):**  That's fantastic, because it's not what a lot of people think of, especially at local  
**[0:24:53-0:24:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:24:53):**  government levels, right?  
**[0:24:56-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:24:56):**  There's a perception that those who are in charge, elected officials have mostly their  
**[0:25:00-0:25:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:25:00):**  own interests at heart, or there's a lot of mistrust based on, you know, buying sway or  
**[0:25:08-0:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:25:08):**  influence from from industry and from private interests.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:25:12):**  Have you seen that come into conflict in this process at all?  
**[0:25:15-0:25:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:25:15):**  Um, let's say I'm just trying to think I are.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:25:20):**  I don't think I've ever seen a chance or a situation where a business tried to sway the  
**[0:25:28-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:25:28):**  results.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:25:29):**  But remember, again, if this is done properly, the you know, the business sector of the community  
**[0:25:35-0:25:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:25:35):**  is involved from the get go as well.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:25:40):**  It either involved as a part of the community process or, you know, having their own workshops.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:25:46):**  That's another involvement.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:25:47):**  I think, you know, I think it's better if you have a process where community people  
**[0:25:53-0:25:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:25:53):**  and business people can mix and get to know each other and work together.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:25:59):**  But again, if you if you do, if you do a good job in the beginning of really carefully identifying  
**[0:26:09-0:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:26:09):**  the different sectors of the community, and the different interests of the community,  
**[0:26:15-0:26:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:26:15):**  and trying to making sure that in the participatory process and workshops that that broad range  
**[0:26:22-0:26:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:26:22):**  of interests, including the businesses are represented from the beginning in those workshops  
**[0:26:29-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:26:29):**  when you're trying to when you're coming up with the broader vision and then and then  
**[0:26:33-0:26:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:26:33):**  the action plans to follow them up, then that's the place where a lot of this gets worked  
**[0:26:40-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:26:40):**  out.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:26:41):**  So that by the time you get farther on, you know, again, everybody's working, you're all  
**[0:26:46-0:26:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:26:46):**  and they're all working with the same set of principles.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:26:50):**  So so so those differences kind of get smoothed out.  
**[0:26:55-0:26:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:26:55):**  Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.  
**[0:26:57-0:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:26:57):**  And it also goes right into a nice transition, because we've been talking now about the things  
**[0:27:02-0:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:27:02):**  that are challenging what are the obstacles for communities moving forward and implementing  
**[0:27:07-0:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:27:07):**  plans like this.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:27:08):**  You also outline three change processes that have been shown to work in the book.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:27:13):**  What are those?  
**[0:27:15-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:27:15):**  I think I think the change processes are well, the one that I think probably works the best  
**[0:27:23-0:27:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:27:23):**  and this is common almost all of them is, you know, the first step is, if you know,  
**[0:27:28-0:27:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:27:28):**  if you're is to find the fire stoles in a community, the people who are really interested  
**[0:27:33-0:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:27:33):**  in making change happen in a sustainable way, and, you know, educating them about this and  
**[0:27:41-0:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:27:41):**  getting them on board and willing to work, and then maybe involving their help in reaching  
**[0:27:47-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:27:47):**  out to the local elected officials and getting them getting them on board.  
**[0:27:55-0:28:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:27:55):**  And then another step is then making, you know, if you if they do, they do get on board,  
**[0:28:05-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:28:05):**  persuading them to adopt those for the municipality principles as official policy, again, because  
**[0:28:13-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:28:13):**  that tells everybody, community, business and government departments that, you know,  
**[0:28:22-0:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:28:22):**  municipality is serious about this thing.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:28:24):**  You know, they really want to do it with those four, coupled with the commitment to a participatory  
**[0:28:32-0:28:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:28:32):**  bottom up process of coming up with the with the vision for the community and an action  
**[0:28:38-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:28:38):**  plan to to to carry it out.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:28:43):**  And then finally, you know, when those those steps are done, which can take anywhere from  
**[0:28:49-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:28:49):**  several months to a year, a year or so, then then, you know, commitments to implementation,  
**[0:28:59-0:29:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:28:59):**  putting those putting those those the community, business and department action plans into  
**[0:29:08-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:29:08):**  action.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:29:10):**  You know, rewriting the zoning codes so that they meet the four principles, revamping how  
**[0:29:18-0:29:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:29:18):**  how capital plans are come up with so that they're they're using the four the four principles  
**[0:29:26-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:29:26):**  or the public works department or, you know, how the community house households and community  
**[0:29:33-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:29:33):**  groups, you know, how what they're doing, what the businesses are are doing.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:29:38):**  And then some way of, you know, of monitoring someone.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:29:43):**  Someone has to keep track of all of this.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:29:48):**  The overview you had asked in your in your list of questions about the mindset of a process  
**[0:29:57-0:29:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:29:57):**  leader.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:29:58):**  And I think the most important one is is to keep the broad overview and to keep track  
**[0:30:04-0:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:30:04):**  of this broad range of of initiatives that's going on in the community.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:30:12):**  Keep track of that and make sure they're moving forward.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:30:17):**  And then over time, the city, you know, to make this this this needs to become part of  
**[0:30:23-0:30:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:30:23):**  the ongoing fabric of everyday life and business for a municipality and the community.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:30:30):**  So so that that those implementation steps need to be put in place to track this and  
**[0:30:39-0:30:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:30:39):**  and help keep it keep it going over time.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:30:43):**  And to build on that leadership topic, you also mentioned sort of fire starters within  
**[0:30:47-0:30:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:30:47):**  a community, identifying them and helping to support the energy that they already bring.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:30:53):**  What if you don't find those people?  
**[0:30:55-0:30:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:30:55):**  How do you become one yourself?  
**[0:30:56-0:31:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:30:56):**  What are some of the characteristics that you have identified in the people that you  
**[0:31:00-0:31:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:31:00):**  have noticed in these projects that are worth sort of giving the extra support to who have  
**[0:31:06-0:31:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:31:06):**  already started things going?  
**[0:31:08-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:31:08):**  Yeah, well, in most cases where we've been approached to help people start one of these  
**[0:31:17-0:31:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:31:17):**  one an eco-missipality, it's been by local fire souls.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:31:22):**  You know, they have read our book or heard about the Swedish eco-missipalities or, you  
**[0:31:29-0:31:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:31:29):**  know, they know people involved.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:31:31):**  So so they're they're all set to go.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:31:35):**  They just need the, you know, the tools and the process for someone in cases where those  
**[0:31:47-0:31:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:31:47):**  people don't exist.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:31:48):**  I think it's, you know, someone who's interested.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:31:54):**  It might be an outsider.  
**[0:31:55-0:32:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:31:55):**  It might be a community person just talking, talking this up, giving talks.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:32:00):**  In fact, one of the first this is one of the there's a region in Wisconsin, the Suomacong  
**[0:32:10-0:32:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:32:10):**  Bay, which is which was the first region in the U.S. to kind of latch on to this and want  
**[0:32:17-0:32:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:32:17):**  to get it going.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:32:19):**  And there were two women who had heard about this.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:32:24):**  I read the book who just started going around their community, giving presentations and  
**[0:32:32-0:32:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:32:32):**  talks about this, getting people interested.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:32:34):**  They went to the Elks and the VFW and the Chamber of Commerce and the City Council and  
**[0:32:41-0:32:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:32:41):**  different community groups.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:32:45):**  And they got people interested and and they actually started this groundswell of people  
**[0:32:50-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:32:50):**  who wanted to go in this direction.  
**[0:32:52-0:33:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:32:52):**  And that's when we were invited in to help help introduce the process and give the work  
**[0:33:00-0:33:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:33:00):**  training workshops.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:33:03):**  So yeah, it's just one or two people who are fired up about the idea and willing to talk  
**[0:33:12-0:33:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:33:12):**  to other people about it and try to get them interested.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:33:15):**  All right.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:33:16):**  So at this point, we've identified obstacles.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:33:18):**  We've talked about processes towards change, how to embody the characteristics of being  
**[0:33:23-0:33:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:33:23):**  a leader or getting things started.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:33:26):**  Where do you start these logical steps so that things kind of move forward in a linear  
**[0:33:30-0:33:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:33:30):**  fashion?  
**[0:33:32-0:33:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:33:32):**  Where do you begin and how do you start to proceed in order to get real change done?  
**[0:33:37-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:33:37):**  Well, we talked about the fire souls.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:33:41):**  We talked about having them or people they know talk to local officials and getting them  
**[0:33:50-0:33:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:33:50):**  on board.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:33:52):**  If they do that, then the first step would be a training session or a presentation with  
**[0:33:57-0:33:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:33:57):**  local officials.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:33:59):**  And if they're receptive to that, then the next step would be trying to get them to pass  
**[0:34:07-0:34:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:34:07):**  an official adoption of those principles and an agreement to a change process, which involves  
**[0:34:16-0:34:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:34:16):**  community participation and department and business participation as well.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:34:23):**  And then the next step would be running workshops in each of those sectors or combined to immediately  
**[0:34:34-0:34:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:34:34):**  start getting community people familiar with those principles, how to work with them and  
**[0:34:40-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:34:40):**  setting the vision for their communities.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:34:43):**  And meanwhile, with department workshops, departments are setting the vision using those  
**[0:34:47-0:34:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:34:47):**  principles for their departments.  
**[0:34:52-0:34:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:34:52):**  Then all of these groups start working on action plans for how their departments or  
**[0:34:58-0:35:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:34:58):**  the community or the city or the town as a whole is going to meet those.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:35:04):**  And then they're working.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:35:05):**  Meanwhile, the process leaders keeping track of all these different groups, which happen  
**[0:35:10-0:35:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:35:10):**  to be many and where they are and where they're going.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:35:15):**  And then that comes back together when they're done with maybe a whole community-wide workshop  
**[0:35:20-0:35:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:35:20):**  where all these different groups present their plans to the larger community, to the city  
**[0:35:28-0:35:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:35:28):**  and departments.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:35:30):**  And hopefully those get approved officially.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:35:34):**  And then the implementation process begins.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:35:37):**  So that's kind of it in a nutshell.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:35:41):**  It sounds so simple when you lay it out like that, but I can see it.  
**[0:35:44-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:35:44):**  Well, it is pretty simple.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:35:45):**  But there must be a lot of complexity baked into this.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:35:48):**  Of course there are.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:35:49):**  Of course there are.  
**[0:35:50-0:36:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:35:50):**  But I think if people can really understand conceptually how simple it is and life happens,  
**[0:36:00-0:36:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:36:00):**  of course.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:36:01):**  But if you can get that and again, hold the broad overview and have enough people skills  
**[0:36:12-0:36:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:36:12):**  to get you over rough patches, I think the chances of success are pretty high.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:36:19):**  And so that role of a process manager who's kind of fielding the new ideas, the proposals  
**[0:36:24-0:36:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:36:24):**  or the progress from all of these different wings or specialties within the larger project  
**[0:36:30-0:36:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:36:30):**  is that what's the skill set involved there and who tends to take on that role and do  
**[0:36:35-0:36:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:36:35):**  well with it?  
**[0:36:37-0:36:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:36:37):**  Well, like I think I said earlier that I think the most important mindset for a process leader  
**[0:36:46-0:36:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:36:46):**  is this ability to hold the bigger picture and to not lose sight of it as different groups  
**[0:36:52-0:36:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:36:52):**  get more and more immersed in their particular issue area.  
**[0:36:57-0:37:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:36:57):**  But to hold that and to keep reminding people that, yes, you're working on this really important  
**[0:37:05-0:37:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:37:05):**  project to build a sustainable daycare center.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:37:09):**  But remember that this is part what we also want to see is the whole community move toward  
**[0:37:16-0:37:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:37:16):**  change.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:37:18):**  I think a process leader needs to have the people skills to deal with differences, which  
**[0:37:26-0:37:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:37:26):**  of course there will be.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:37:29):**  And to be able to have people see, again, when they're sort of caught in their own particular  
**[0:37:37-0:37:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:37:37):**  perspective, the process leader can really help people to see things from another perspective.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:37:49):**  Because again, this is part of the systems approach.  
**[0:37:56-0:38:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:37:56):**  And it's easy when you get bogged down to get caught in your own mindset.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:38:01):**  But this is where working for a common goal can really help.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:38:07):**  And working, you know, when everybody agrees that we're all, no matter what our different  
**[0:38:13-0:38:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:38:13):**  issue or department roles are, we're all working toward these four same sustainability objectives,  
**[0:38:25-0:38:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:38:25):**  then it's going to be a lot easier.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:38:26):**  Again, the process leader can help with this to get people to see that even though the  
**[0:38:34-0:38:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:38:34):**  affordable housing advocates on the one hand and the green conservation people maybe at  
**[0:38:42-0:38:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:38:42):**  loggerheads over whether a particular parcel or area is going to be housing, then I think  
**[0:38:48-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:38:48):**  a good process leader can help them try to see that both of these things are important  
**[0:38:56-0:39:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:38:56):**  and whether there is a way of satisfying both issue goals in this situation.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:39:06):**  And I'm curious what sort of projects and initiatives you've seen come out of this process  
**[0:39:11-0:39:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:39:11):**  that you've been teaching for a while.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:39:13):**  What are some of the emerging characteristics that maybe you didn't even see coming when  
**[0:39:18-0:39:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:39:18):**  you first presented it?  
**[0:39:22-0:39:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:39:22):**  Well I think one of the most wonderful things to see is, well there was a community that  
**[0:39:33-0:39:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:39:33):**  we visited, the very first Swedish econ municipality called Overtornio, and we visited that and  
**[0:39:40-0:39:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:39:40):**  we talked to a lot of the local folks who had been working in this direction for more  
**[0:39:49-0:39:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:39:49):**  than a decade.  
**[0:39:52-0:40:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:39:52):**  And one of them said, well what's it like, what's it like doing all these things in such  
**[0:40:00-0:40:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:40:00):**  a great sustainable way?  
**[0:40:01-0:40:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:40:01):**  And he said, this is just the normal way of doing things here.  
**[0:40:07-0:40:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:40:07):**  And I thought that was one of the most wonderful outcomes to come out of a process like this,  
**[0:40:16-0:40:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:40:16):**  that working towards sustainable goals becomes just part of what you do naturally.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:40:25):**  And we have seen that happen in cases.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:40:29):**  And I think that's, to me, that's one of the most wonderful outcomes I've seen.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:40:36):**  And I know since this book, you're telling me before this interview, you've also written  
**[0:40:40-0:40:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:40:40):**  a process manual, especially geared towards open planning for sustainability.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:40:46):**  Can you tell me about that manual and some of the learnings since writing the book that  
**[0:40:50-0:40:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:40:50):**  went into it?  
**[0:40:51-0:40:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:40:51):**  Sure.  
**[0:40:53-0:41:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:40:53):**  The idea there was to really write down in a way that we didn't do in a very detailed  
**[0:41:00-0:41:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:41:00):**  way in a book, but just the step by step processes that a group of interested people or local  
**[0:41:09-0:41:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:41:09):**  officials can go through to really create an eco-missipality.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:41:14):**  And it involves a lot of what we've talked about here, the finding the fire souls, doing  
**[0:41:22-0:41:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:41:22):**  the community workshops, how you design a training process, what the process leader  
**[0:41:33-0:41:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:41:33):**  should do, all these steps so that it's pretty clear for anyone interested how you can move  
**[0:41:41-0:41:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:41:41):**  forward.  
**[0:41:42-0:41:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:41:42):**  So that's why we put together and put online our manual, the Open Planning for Sustainability.  
**[0:41:51-0:41:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:41:51):**  And the term open planning is to get the idea across that this is a participatory approach.  
**[0:41:59-0:42:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:41:59):**  Is this meant, this is a process that's meant to involve everyone in a systematic way, in  
**[0:42:07-0:42:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:42:07):**  an organized way.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:42:11):**  And that it's a process where the community and the local government and the business  
**[0:42:17-0:42:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:42:17):**  sector can work together concurrently to make change over time in a sustainable way.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:42:27):**  Now before we wrap up, can you tell me about your personal vision and the potential for  
**[0:42:33-0:42:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:42:33):**  communities all around the world, or at least the ones that you have referenced to, when  
**[0:42:37-0:42:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:42:37):**  implementing or practicing these types of processes, what can they achieve?  
**[0:42:43-0:42:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:42:43):**  What do you see as the potential for the communities that you've worked with in reaching their  
**[0:42:49-0:42:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:42:49):**  sustainability goals?  
**[0:42:53-0:43:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:42:53):**  I see the potential for rapid change, rapid comprehensive systematic change toward becoming  
**[0:43:03-0:43:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:43:03):**  a sustainability over time.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:43:08):**  Being a planner and working in sustainability for quite a few years now, I've had the chance  
**[0:43:16-0:43:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:43:16):**  to see other types of sustainable community processes that are out there and why they're,  
**[0:43:26-0:43:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:43:26):**  while many if not most of them are laudable, I have yet to see a change process that is  
**[0:43:39-0:43:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:43:39):**  as successful as ours, if I could say so.  
**[0:43:42-0:43:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:43:42):**  It's successful in terms of involving the broad range of community sectors in a systematic  
**[0:43:51-0:44:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:43:51):**  way and a broad set of issues over time and resulting in change that sticks.  
**[0:44:02-0:44:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:44:02):**  So that's what I would say.  
**[0:44:06-0:44:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:44:06):**  I love it.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:44:07):**  So Sarah, how can our listeners get in touch with you, learn how to get access to the process  
**[0:44:14-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:44:14):**  manual and see some of the other resources that you put up?  
**[0:44:19-0:44:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:44:19):**  We are in the process of developing a new platform for this which involves not just  
**[0:44:29-0:44:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:44:29):**  people in the United States but people around the world and it's called EcoMuna and my co-author  
**[0:44:36-0:44:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:44:36):**  and partner Torbjorn Lati is working on that as is our helpmate and coordinator Cindy Conte.  
**[0:44:49-0:45:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:44:49):**  Cindy Conte is the coordinator for EcoMuna and so people should contact her.  
**[0:45:01-0:45:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:45:01):**  I think if people go to the Sustainablesweden.org website and look for EcoMuna, they can see  
**[0:45:09-0:45:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:45:09):**  the progress on EcoMuna.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:45:12):**  We're in the process of training process leaders right now but we'll be doing a broader outreach  
**[0:45:23-0:45:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:45:23):**  effort in a few months.  
**[0:45:26-0:45:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:45:26):**  So look on that website, Sustainablesweden.org and then look for EcoMuna when you get to  
**[0:45:34-0:45:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:45:34):**  that website.  
**[0:45:35-0:45:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:45:35):**  I think it's a good place to wrap it up.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:45:38):**  Sarah, thank you so much for making the time to chat with me.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:45:41):**  It's my pleasure, it's been fun to talk to you.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:45:46):**  Thank you for your interest, I appreciate it.

**[0:46:00-0:46:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:46:00):**  Now before we wrap this up, remember that these episodes are only the beginning of the  
**[0:46:04-0:46:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:46:04):**  ongoing conversations happening around these topics on the Regenerative Skills Discord

**[0:46:23-0:46:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:46:23):**  it's all happening there.  
**[0:46:24-0:46:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:46:24):**  So come join the growing community of Earth Regenerators on the forum by signing up through

**[0:46:33-0:46:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:46:33):**  And that's our show for this week, as always, don't forget to keep taking those little steps  
**[0:46:37-0:46:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/sarah-james-on-the-natural-steps-for-regenerating-communities/#t=0:46:37):**  every day towards a regenerative future, and I'll be right by your side along the way.

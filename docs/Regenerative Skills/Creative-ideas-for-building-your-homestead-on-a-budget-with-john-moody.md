**[0:00:38-0:00:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:00:38):**  Alright, welcome to another episode on this ongoing series on homesteading.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:00:45):**  Now in this session, I reached out to Jon Moody, the author of many books including

**[0:01:09-0:01:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:01:09):**  Like many of the people interviewed in this series, Jon decided to take a major transition  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:01:12):**  in his lifestyle when he discovered that his diet was literally killing him with duodenal  
**[0:01:17-0:01:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:01:17):**  ulcers, seasonal allergies and other health problems.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:01:21):**  So he and his growing family began to transition to real local foods and local food distribution  
**[0:01:27-0:01:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:01:27):**  and eventually a life on a homestead on 35 acres in rural Kentucky.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:01:33):**  Since then, he has become a well-known speaker at conferences, events and media including  
**[0:01:37-0:01:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:01:37):**  Mother Earth news, wise traditions and others.

**[0:01:47-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:01:47):**  More than just a list of tips and tricks, Jon promotes a mindset of resourcefulness

**[0:03:15-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:03:15):**  I'm doing really well.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:03:16):**  It sounds like from our little chat before this we've both been working outside quite  
**[0:03:19-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:03:19):**  a bit today.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:03:21):**  You're chopping up a bunch of wood for use of fires and stuff later?  
**[0:03:26-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:03:26):**  Yeah we're just, we had our property selectively logged this past fall and so now we're going  
**[0:03:34-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:03:34):**  back through and cleaning up all the leftover wood.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:03:40):**  Some of it's going to go to firewood, some of it's going to go to crafting, some of it's  
**[0:03:45-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:03:45):**  going to go to soil building and then there's you know some of the areas we had them log  
**[0:03:51-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:03:51):**  and inspecting and then we're going to get them overseeded to transition some of our  
**[0:03:58-0:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:03:58):**  kind of semi-productive woodland to hopefully more productive silvopasture type land.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:04:04):**  Hey that's exciting and if I remember correctly you're on 35 acres?  
**[0:04:10-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:04:10):**  Yeah roughly, I think that's about right.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:04:13):**  So what was the motivation for having it selectively logged like this?  
**[0:04:18-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:04:18):**  Are you able to generate some money this way or is it just like a larger part of the plan  
**[0:04:22-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:04:22):**  to transition it towards silvopasture?  
**[0:04:26-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:04:26):**  Well it was, you know when I do consulting work with people who want a farmer homestead  
**[0:04:32-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:04:32):**  I always talk about like stacking goals and functions.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:04:38):**  So we had some trees that either had disease or lightning strike or here in the states  
**[0:04:46-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:04:46):**  we have a problem with something called the emerald ash borer.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:04:52):**  So had a part of the farm that had some really good trees that if we let them sit another  
**[0:04:59-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:04:59):**  five to ten years they were no longer going to be good trees.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:05:06):**  So it was and it was part of the farm as well that I really wanted to open up some access  
**[0:05:12-0:05:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:05:12):**  to in terms of expanding the pasture land.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:05:18):**  You know so basically it was just it was a number of different things coming together  
**[0:05:22-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:05:22):**  where it makes sense financially to get some of these trees taken down right now.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:05:28):**  It makes sense ecologically that if you can find you know a responsible logger to work  
**[0:05:34-0:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:05:34):**  with you know everything's going to benefit once we finally finish all the parts and pieces.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:05:43):**  Very interesting that sounds like a really cool project.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:05:46):**  I'm interested to see how this continues to move forward but before we go into more of  
**[0:05:50-0:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:05:50):**  the details about your situation why don't you give us an idea of your background because  
**[0:05:55-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:05:55):**  you did not start out homesteading.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:05:57):**  How did you go from the lifestyle that you led growing up to well give me the steps into  
**[0:06:05-0:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:06:05):**  how you got into homesteading from the beginning.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:06:08):**  Yeah I'll give you this I'll give you like the cliff notes version.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:06:11):**  It would have to be right it's a long story.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:06:13):**  It is a long story you know basically I grew up just off of the edge of being an inner

**[0:06:42-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:06:42):**  seasonal allergies and dental decay and you're on antibiotics and a couple other pharmaceuticals  
**[0:06:48-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:06:48):**  a few times a year that's how the average American defines health.

**[0:07:33-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:07:33):**  ulcers are basically just like you're getting ripped apart from the inside out just constant  
**[0:07:40-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:07:40):**  debilitating pain and through that and some other influences instead of going the route  
**[0:07:51-0:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:07:51):**  of pharmaceuticals and surgeries me and my then fiance now my wife we completely rethought  
**[0:08:03-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:08:03):**  you know our entire approach to food which also then bled over in our approach to lifestyle  
**[0:08:10-0:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:08:10):**  which eventually just like gobbled up everything.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:08:14):**  Wow.

**[0:08:24-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:08:24):**  Wendy's to you know now we live on 35 acres and we home birthed all of our kids like we  
**[0:08:34-0:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:08:34):**  went all we went about as far down the rabbit hole as you can possibly go.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:08:39):**  Yeah that's a major transition and like even though you see it from a different perspective  
**[0:08:44-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:08:44):**  now I'm sure a lot of listeners can relate to that situation that you came from as well.

**[0:09:00-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:09:00):**  sprinting on a fairly undeveloped piece of land in Kentucky?  
**[0:09:07-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:09:07):**  I think insanity.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:09:10):**  Fair enough fair enough.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:09:12):**  Well so after my health crisis I founded a local foods buying club in Louisville, Kentucky  
**[0:09:22-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:09:22):**  called Louisville Whole Life because I began to realize that like the kind of food that  
**[0:09:29-0:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:09:29):**  would build my health you can't really find in grocery stores.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:09:35):**  You know especially this would have been back in like 2004-2005.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:09:42):**  It's a grocery stores and the states were a completely different world because this  
**[0:09:48-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:09:48):**  is you know pre-omnivore's dilemma and so much else that we saw happen you know just  
**[0:09:57-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:09:57):**  before 2010 and you know like the explosion of organics and other things that's really  
**[0:10:04-0:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:10:04):**  happened from 2010 to 2020.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:10:07):**  So a lot of the things I wanted I couldn't find in stores so I founded this local foods  
**[0:10:14-0:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:10:14):**  buying club and then when I would go to farmers markets or other places and try and find suppliers  
**[0:10:22-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:10:22):**  for some of the things we wanted at times I just had farmers tell me well that's impossible.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:10:29):**  You know you can't raise beef without feeding it grain.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:10:34):**  You can't raise you know you can't grow apples without spraying them with a hundred different

**[0:10:47-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:10:47):**  Yeah so you know just like I don't really have a way to figure out if what you're saying  
**[0:10:53-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:10:53):**  is legit so I'm gonna have to have land to see if what you're saying is accurate.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:11:00):**  It does seem counterintuitive when you hear advice like that right because it's a very  
**[0:11:06-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:11:06):**  recent transition into doing things the mechanical and industrial way as far as like the history

**[0:11:16-0:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:11:16):**  with people when they hear that it's the only way to do things anymore.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:11:21):**  Oh yeah well and you know I live in a fairly rural area of Kentucky.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:11:27):**  Have some really great neighbors so I don't say this in any way to pick on my neighbors  
**[0:11:33-0:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:11:33):**  but when some of them basically say to me well this is how my dad and my granddad did  
**[0:11:40-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:11:40):**  it.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:11:42):**  Like that's great but that's basically 100 years out of thousands of years of agricultural  
**[0:11:48-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:11:48):**  history.

**[0:11:50-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:11:50):**  So and the previous years have a better track record than the current years.  
**[0:11:58-0:11:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:11:58):**  Certainly.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:11:59):**  And you know and I don't blame them because a lot of the bad agricultural practices in  
**[0:12:05-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:12:05):**  America were really driven by you know experts who were not experts in any meaningful sense  
**[0:12:12-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:12:12):**  of the word you know basically doing large-scale experiments across the entire US ecosystems.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:12:23):**  So but that's a big topic for another.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:12:26):**  Yeah that's another rabbit hole we could go down for an entire episode but so look so  
**[0:12:31-0:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:12:31):**  let's focus a little bit on the lifestyle of homesteading.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:12:36):**  Like anyone who's done any research on homesteading and especially looking into starting one from  
**[0:12:40-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:12:40):**  scratch will know that there's like a ton of infrastructure, equipment, and materials  
**[0:12:46-0:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:12:46):**  that eventually you're going to need if you need to make things run smoothly and efficiently.

**[0:12:56-0:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:12:56):**  the list can be super daunting especially if you're working with a really small budget.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:13:01):**  So before we jump into all the money-saving tips and advice from your book The Frugal  
**[0:13:06-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:13:06):**  Homesteader, tell me about your own homestead and what systems and enterprises you've attempted  
**[0:13:12-0:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:13:12):**  for yourself and your family.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:13:13):**  Oh I mean we've raised pigs, chickens, turkeys, ducks, rabbits, you know we've done a tremendous  
**[0:13:25-0:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:13:25):**  variety of things over the decade we've been here and you know currently you know the main  
**[0:13:35-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:13:35):**  things we focus on at this point in time are we raise a limited number of pigs each year  
**[0:13:42-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:13:42):**  you know usually four to eight.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:13:46):**  We do a fair bit of vegetable production so we have a high tunnel you know which is basically  
**[0:13:54-0:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:13:54):**  like a modified type of greenhouse and so we have both you know that you know temperature  
**[0:14:04-0:14:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:14:04):**  what's the word I'm looking for you know season extended growing space and then we have field  
**[0:14:08-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:14:08):**  growing space and then we have an elderberry syrup business which we started about three  
**[0:14:16-0:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:14:16):**  years ago and is now really kind of a major part of the financial side of the you know  
**[0:14:23-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:14:23):**  farm homestead operation.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:14:25):**  Oh very cool and so within those systems where would you say you are at or maybe even still  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:14:33):**  aiming for as far as self-sufficiency and generating most of what you consume if that's  
**[0:14:38-0:14:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:14:38):**  one of your major goals?  
**[0:14:41-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:14:41):**  Yeah you know we're actually in the process of probably moving to a different property  
**[0:14:47-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:14:47):**  okay and so you know one thing I always say to people I wish I would have known before  
**[0:14:53-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:14:53):**  we would have purchased our land but fencing, fencing is like so expensive in the states  
**[0:15:03-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:15:03):**  now and so our entire property needs fenced because you know a lot of our neighbors don't  
**[0:15:13-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:15:13):**  keep animals anymore you know because the piece of property we're on used to be like  
**[0:15:19-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:15:19):**  a two or three hundred acre farm that just slowly has been cut up into five acre pieces  
**[0:15:26-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:15:26):**  ten acre pieces and so you have a lot of people that live out here but they work you know  
**[0:15:36-0:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:15:36):**  in town somewhere else so all the fencing has basically rotted to you know rotted wood  
**[0:15:44-0:15:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:15:44):**  and rust along the property lines.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:15:48):**  It doesn't work anymore.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:15:49):**  Yeah and so like everything needs re-fenced and for us to re-fence the property it would  
**[0:15:55-0:16:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:15:55):**  cost us around easily probably fifteen to twenty thousand dollars.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:16:00):**  Yeah that's a hit and you know that's not something that's paying you back very quickly  
**[0:16:04-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:16:04):**  either.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:16:05):**  Well and really like it's I don't know if you'd ever fully recoup that investment.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:16:12):**  So fencing you know like we don't have a tractor I think the only mechanized equipment I have  
**[0:16:23-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:16:23):**  is chainsaw and log splitter.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:16:27):**  So we don't have a tractor I'm getting ready most likely to sell my farm truck because  
**[0:16:33-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:16:33):**  I so rarely use it.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:16:35):**  That's a good position to be in.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:16:38):**  And so you know like infrastructure matters far more than equipment.

**[0:20:01-0:20:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:20:01):**  ago because we were having a hard time managing the inside portion of our homestead because  
**[0:20:08-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:20:08):**  we got five kids and we have a couple different businesses and we homeschool.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:20:17):**  She's basically gotten rid of over half of our possessions over the past six months.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:20:26):**  Wow.

**[0:20:32-0:20:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:20:32):**  And it has really made you know like less stuff has made us life so much easier and  
**[0:20:42-0:20:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:20:42):**  making us so much more successful.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:20:45):**  Yeah no I believe it.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:20:46):**  I've gone through transitions like that.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:20:48):**  I mean most of my early years when I was traveling a lot everything I had was in a backpack and  
**[0:20:55-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:20:55):**  the options that that alone opens up like I would never been able to do half of the  
**[0:20:59-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:20:59):**  things that I did without having that kind of opportunity to reduce and just live minimally.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:21:08):**  So look the focus of the book is frugal homesteading but from the very beginning you recommend  
**[0:21:16-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:21:16):**  saving up and getting some of the highest quality items possible.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:21:21):**  How does that fit into kind of an overall frugal mindset?  
**[0:21:27-0:21:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:21:27):**  Because you'll never regret buying quality for core items that you're going to need on  
**[0:21:35-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:21:35):**  your homestead.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:21:36):**  So it's actually far cheaper you know because especially like living out in a rural area  
**[0:21:44-0:21:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:21:44):**  if something does break on you you know like if a tool fails or something else fails you  
**[0:21:53-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:21:53):**  I'm looking at sometimes basically losing half a day to go to a place where I can get  
**[0:22:00-0:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:22:00):**  it fixed or get a replacement.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:22:05):**  And so you know I never there's just some areas where cutting corners and costs is not  
**[0:22:13-0:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:22:13):**  going to long term actually save you money or time.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:22:19):**  One of my favorite pieces of advice on that is that like people are too poor to buy cheap  
**[0:22:28-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:22:28):**  things and it completely switches the narrative of like oh I need to save money I'll just  
**[0:22:33-0:22:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:22:33):**  get you know this thing temporarily and you start to think about how much you actually  
**[0:22:37-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:22:37):**  lose in the long run for not just waiting taking more time with your purchases getting  
**[0:22:42-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:22:42):**  something of higher quality with a good guarantee on it a good track record knowing that you're  
**[0:22:46-0:22:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:22:46):**  going to use it a lot and you actually end up saving a lot in the long run.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:22:52):**  Tell me a little bit about this concept that you've mentioned in the book as well Pennywise  
**[0:22:57-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:22:57):**  and Pound Foolish.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:22:58):**  Give me an example of where that's come up because obviously you can go too far with

**[0:25:49-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:25:49):**  know just like pay off any debt you possibly can because that'll get you as close to freedom  
**[0:25:54-0:25:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:25:54):**  as possible.  
**[0:25:55-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:25:55):**  And I just responded I was just like it just really depends you know because like right  
**[0:26:02-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:26:02):**  now at least in the States mortgage interest rates I think are down near 3%.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:26:11):**  You know the rate of interest on a mortgage is basically almost equal to inflation.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:26:19):**  So like it costs you almost nothing to borrow money like to have your land and property  
**[0:26:26-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:26:26):**  so if that $5,000 is going to let you start a business that generates $20,000 a year in  
**[0:26:35-0:26:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:26:35):**  income or something like then using that $5,000 to pay off debt is not the smartest thing  
**[0:26:43-0:26:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:26:43):**  to do with that $5,000.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:26:45):**  Yeah absolutely.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:26:48):**  So people like simple answers that don't require them to do a lot of mental legwork.  
**[0:26:55-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:26:55):**  Yeah they want answers so when they ask you a question the answer is not it depends and  
**[0:26:59-0:27:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:26:59):**  then you have to clarify all the situations and really do the research required to make  
**[0:27:04-0:27:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:27:04):**  a good choice.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:27:06):**  Yeah and so I know I irritate people because when I'm speaking at conferences I very rarely  
**[0:27:14-0:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:27:14):**  give an unqualified answer to a complicated question.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:27:21):**  Right it's irresponsible at a certain point.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:27:24):**  Yeah well you know one of my favorite lines in the Lord of the Rings is Samwise Gamgee  
**[0:27:31-0:27:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:27:31):**  I believe is asking an elf for advice and the elf responds that seldom do the elves  
**[0:27:39-0:27:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:27:39):**  give advice because even the council of the wise can go horribly wrong.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:27:46):**  You know so it's just like you know because people want other people to make decisions  
**[0:27:54-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:27:54):**  for them.  
**[0:27:55-0:27:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:27:55):**  Sure and I totally understand it I mean I have those tendencies too it's hard to constantly  
**[0:27:58-0:28:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:27:58):**  be making those difficult decisions because you have to live with the responsibility that  
**[0:28:02-0:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:28:02):**  you came up with it too.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:28:04):**  Yeah and so you know that's another thing if you want to succeed as a homesteader you  
**[0:28:10-0:28:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:28:10):**  have to develop the attitude that the buck stops with you.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:28:16):**  At the end of the day you can't blame the person on YouTube or the article you read.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:28:23):**  You really have to own your decisions and you know like because I've made homesteading  
**[0:28:29-0:28:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:28:29):**  mistakes there's things I wish I would have known better or done differently and unless  
**[0:28:36-0:28:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:28:36):**  you're really willing to own them you're never going to grow and if you don't grow you're  
**[0:28:40-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:28:40):**  never going to reach your goals.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:28:43):**  And I mean at a certain point you just have to accept that that's part of the journey  
**[0:28:47-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:28:47):**  too.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:28:48):**  Nobody goes through a big project undertaking without experience and does it without mistakes  
**[0:28:53-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:28:53):**  even the people who have tons of experience are constantly making mistakes and learning  
**[0:28:57-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:28:57):**  from them and to avoid that part of the process I mean of course you don't want to go into  
**[0:29:02-0:29:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:29:02):**  it purposely making large costly mistakes you're going to do your best but to think  
**[0:29:08-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:29:08):**  that you can go through something that large and complicated and not mess up a few times  
**[0:29:13-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:29:13):**  is completely unrealistic.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:29:16):**  Yeah well and that's why I recommend like you know one of the principles I always hit  
**[0:29:21-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:29:21):**  on is you know starting small.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:29:24):**  Yeah because then you limit your risk and loss exposure while you gain experience.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:29:35):**  So another concept that I like in the book that is kind of it relates to a lot of other  
**[0:29:40-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:29:40):**  things is bulk buying and planning ahead.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:29:43):**  I'm kind of touching on the things that give advice or suggestions around buying first  
**[0:29:48-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:29:48):**  before we start looking at all the other alternatives.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:29:52):**  What are some of the things that you recommend that people analyze within their consumption  
**[0:29:57-0:30:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:29:57):**  that would be worth maybe buying in bulk or planning you know well ahead to see if there  
**[0:30:02-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:30:02):**  could be some major savings in changing the way they purchase?  
**[0:30:06-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:30:06):**  Yeah you know so like for us you know we buy toilet paper in 60 count cases.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:30:15):**  You know because it's just like and I have a barrel up in my barn or you know sawdust.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:30:25):**  I have a local neighbor great Amish guy has a sawmill and you can buy sawdust from him  
**[0:30:33-0:30:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:30:33):**  and it's like 20 bucks for a scoop of sawdust.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:30:38):**  So tons of people go get sawdust from him and it always made me scratch my head because  
**[0:30:45-0:30:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:30:45):**  you know a lot of these people probably driving an hour so total and then you got to unload  
**[0:30:50-0:30:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:30:50):**  the sawdust by hand you know so you drive there you have to get loaded with the sawdust  
**[0:30:57-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:30:57):**  and sometimes he's busy so you might be waiting you know 30 minutes 45 minutes before he can  
**[0:31:03-0:31:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:31:03):**  get to you.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:31:05):**  Then you know you drive home and as you drive home you always lose a bunch of sawdust on  
**[0:31:09-0:31:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:31:09):**  the way even if you tarp it and then you got to shovel that sawdust off your truck and  
**[0:31:16-0:31:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:31:16):**  you know it's like you know what three cubic yard of sawdust maybe you know probably not  
**[0:31:21-0:31:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:31:21):**  even that much you can fit in the back of a truck.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:31:25):**  So I can get and it's like 20-25 bucks so once you factor in your time and everything  
**[0:31:32-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:31:32):**  you're probably paying easily $50 or more for that little load of sawdust.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:31:38):**  There's another sawmill in my area that will deliver to my farm a triaxial load of sawdust  
**[0:31:47-0:31:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:31:47):**  which I think is about 30 to 40 of my neighbors scoops and I will point to a spot and they  
**[0:31:55-0:31:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:31:55):**  will dump it in that spot and I will hand them $150.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:31:59):**  So for three times the cost I get back half a day and I get 30 to 40 times more sawdust.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:32:08):**  Yeah it's just you know there's just a lot of things depending on what you need and when  
**[0:32:18-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:32:18):**  you need it and how you plan for it that you can get a larger quantity and it's not going  
**[0:32:25-0:32:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:32:25):**  to hurt you it's only going to help you.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:32:28):**  Yeah I mean of course there's circumstances within that you got to have a place to put  
**[0:32:32-0:32:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:32:32):**  that much sawdust to begin with and know what you're going to do with it but yeah definitely.

**[0:42:47-0:42:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:42:47):**  regardless for less money.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:42:50):**  Let's talk about kind of the more difficult evaluation process and where you found the  
**[0:42:55-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:42:55):**  most sort of bang for your buck when it comes to time invested in self-sufficiency tasks.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:43:01):**  Things like water systems or power.  
**[0:43:04-0:43:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:43:04):**  What is really worth putting the time in early on and getting set up correctly to save money  
**[0:43:10-0:43:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:43:10):**  and obviously more time down the line.  
**[0:43:14-0:43:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:43:14):**  Yeah you know any task that you have to do daily is crying out for evaluation for automation.  
**[0:43:28-0:43:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:43:28):**  So you know so this really was driven home to me a number of years ago where a group  
**[0:43:37-0:43:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:43:37):**  of homesteaders were discussing what they spent the most time on each week and two of  
**[0:43:44-0:43:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:43:44):**  the main things I heard again and again was people spending time watering their animals  
**[0:43:50-0:43:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:43:50):**  and watering their gardens and people spending time weeding.  
**[0:43:56-0:44:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:43:56):**  And you know so two of my books my one book Winning the War on Weeds is all about you  
**[0:44:03-0:44:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:44:03):**  know basically reducing the amount of time you spend weeding by as great a percentage  
**[0:44:09-0:44:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:44:09):**  as possible and then you know Frugal Homesteader deals with reducing the amount of time you  
**[0:44:14-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:44:14):**  spend on those other two tasks.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:44:19):**  So like you know you can buy all sorts of irrigation systems depending on what type  
**[0:44:28-0:44:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:44:28):**  of garden and growing space you're using you know or depending on your land and your setup  
**[0:44:35-0:44:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:44:35):**  you could merely do rain catchment off your roof and then run some lateral hoses or pipelines  
**[0:44:43-0:44:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:44:43):**  or whatever from the rain catchment to your garden to automate and make you know watering  
**[0:44:49-0:44:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:44:49):**  easier you know with animals.

**[0:44:58-0:45:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:44:58):**  I'm like have you never heard of a hose?  
**[0:45:03-0:45:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:45:03):**  You know because it's just like you know like unless you're trying to look like Arnold Schwarzenegger  
**[0:45:08-0:45:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:45:08):**  there's just not a whole lot of return on investment doing that much needless manual  
**[0:45:14-0:45:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:45:14):**  labor.  
**[0:45:15-0:45:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:45:15):**  Yeah and you know at a certain point you're just gonna get exhausted and there's things  
**[0:45:19-0:45:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:45:19):**  like that that make people throw in the towel when you know they've got a lot going for  
**[0:45:25-0:45:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:45:25):**  them they could continue on but if you're just spending so much time on those types  
**[0:45:30-0:45:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:45:30):**  of tasks and are not thinking about how to do them more efficiently more easily and recoup  
**[0:45:35-0:45:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:45:35):**  that time because I mean nobody gets into this wanting to work all the time you want  
**[0:45:40-0:45:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:45:40):**  to enjoy some of what you've built and what you've developed but it's stuff like that  
**[0:45:45-0:45:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:45:45):**  that really gets in the way.  
**[0:45:47-0:45:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:45:47):**  Yeah I'll say almost no one.  
**[0:45:49-0:45:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:45:49):**  I've met a few people over the years.  
**[0:45:52-0:45:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:45:52):**  Fair enough there's a few in every group right?  
**[0:45:56-0:46:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:45:56):**  Yeah well and the big thing is you know like I started judo a few years ago.

**[0:46:10-0:46:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:46:10):**  people when they talk with our family about homesteading is like homesteading is part  
**[0:46:17-0:46:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:46:17):**  of what our family does but it's not the only thing we do and it's part of who we are but  
**[0:46:26-0:46:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:46:26):**  it is not like who we are.

**[0:46:30-0:46:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:46:30):**  And so you know like there's just more to life you know I taught when I was you know  
**[0:46:37-0:46:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:46:37):**  speaking at some conferences last year I saw a lot of light bulbs go off and audience members  
**[0:46:43-0:46:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:46:43):**  when I talked about you know like if your homestead means that you all never get to  
**[0:46:49-0:46:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:46:49):**  go to the beach you never get to catch a movie if that's your thing.  
**[0:46:55-0:47:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:46:55):**  You don't get to do a sport or a martial art or whatever you know even if you as an adult  
**[0:47:03-0:47:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:47:03):**  survive homesteading I really doubt your children are going to want to continue with that lifestyle.  
**[0:47:11-0:47:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:47:11):**  You know so it's like we do judo.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:47:14):**  I'll have done judo Friday, Saturday and again tonight theoretically.

**[0:47:28-0:47:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:47:28):**  Now that's a little rare this Saturday was a special occasion but you know our homesteading  
**[0:47:36-0:47:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:47:36):**  doesn't you know basically destroy all the other fun aspects of life because our homestead  
**[0:47:43-0:47:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:47:43):**  and then any businesses related to it we're just always pushing for efficiency.  
**[0:47:52-0:47:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:47:52):**  Yeah and I mean you know efficiency is something that can not only free up time but make those  
**[0:47:59-0:48:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:47:59):**  tasks simpler and if you've got it kind of worked out into a system it also makes it  
**[0:48:05-0:48:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:48:05):**  easier to offload to somebody else if you have to so that it doesn't bottleneck with  
**[0:48:10-0:48:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:48:10):**  one person.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:48:11):**  That's the one thing that I really learned when we were working on the homestead in Guatemala  
**[0:48:16-0:48:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:48:16):**  before I moved out here is we made a real effort to kind of teach everybody else the  
**[0:48:21-0:48:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:48:21):**  systems in our groups so that in case someone else you know was unavailable for whatever  
**[0:48:25-0:48:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:48:25):**  reason it didn't fall apart.  
**[0:48:28-0:48:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:48:28):**  There has got to be some redundancy in it as well.  
**[0:48:31-0:48:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:48:31):**  Yeah well that's one another reason we want to move is you know the one irreplaceable  
**[0:48:40-0:48:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:48:40):**  thing is a person in any homestead system.  
**[0:48:46-0:48:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:48:46):**  You know there's just no way to replace you right and but the problem is sometimes you  
**[0:48:52-0:49:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:48:52):**  have to be replaced you know because like family members pass away, people give birth  
**[0:49:00-0:49:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:49:00):**  you know like and having you know another homestead farm family who's really close by  
**[0:49:10-0:49:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:49:10):**  and who has you know similar experience and skill set is just invaluable.

**[0:49:18-0:49:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:49:18):**  It's like when we try and have people you know farm sit and homestead sit for us especially  
**[0:49:25-0:49:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:49:25):**  when we used to have a lot more animals you're reminded very quickly that there's a presidential  
**[0:49:36-0:49:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:49:36):**  candidate in the past few days who basically said something really disparaging about farming.  
**[0:49:43-0:49:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:49:43):**  You know basically that you know this farming stuff doesn't take a lot of mental gray matter  
**[0:49:52-0:49:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:49:52):**  and I'm like I want you to come farm sit for me for a few days.

**[0:49:58-0:50:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:49:58):**  Because if you perform like almost any other people we've had come farm sit my phone's  
**[0:50:04-0:50:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:50:04):**  gonna be ringing all the time while I'm trying to take a vacation.

**[0:50:14-0:50:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:50:14):**  it was.  
**[0:50:16-0:50:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:50:16):**  For sure.  
**[0:50:17-0:50:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:50:17):**  Yeah anytime you're dealing with living systems I mean the amount of things the variables  
**[0:50:24-0:50:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:50:24):**  of things that could go wrong or change or really throw off what you thought you had  
**[0:50:29-0:50:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:50:29):**  you know well ordered or whatnot it just goes through the roof.  
**[0:50:34-0:50:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:50:34):**  I mean even plants themselves are difficult and then can change you know without without  
**[0:50:41-0:50:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:50:41):**  being able to foresee it then you add in you know all the other elements especially animals  
**[0:50:46-0:50:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:50:46):**  and it's like whoa you really got to know your systems.

**[0:51:11-0:51:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:51:11):**  learning how to do them for yourself not just in saving money but the options that open  
**[0:51:16-0:51:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=0:51:16):**  up when this is something that you integrate in with your lifestyle.

**[1:00:29-1:00:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:00:29):**  to look at things as well how convenient can we make them by outsourcing them or paying  
**[1:00:35-1:00:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:00:35):**  for them to be done for us, it's not really a loss of time if you're learning things in  
**[1:00:41-1:00:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:00:41):**  the process, if you're working outside, if you're doing all of these other things that  
**[1:00:48-1:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:00:48):**  we've kind of been taught to avoid.  
**[1:00:50-1:00:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:00:50):**  There's a richness in the process that can bring a lot more than just independence but  
**[1:00:57-1:01:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:00:57):**  kind of just how our bodies were meant to be used, how our minds were meant to be challenged,  
**[1:01:03-1:01:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:01:03):**  like there's benefits at every turn for working more on general independence in our lives.  
**[1:01:09-1:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:01:09):**  Oh yeah, well it's like today I got to hike outside, I probably got cut up a month's worth  
**[1:01:20-1:01:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:01:20):**  of firewood and when you go work a job that pays you, you then have to pay all the taxes  
**[1:01:32-1:01:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:01:32):**  on that work and then you can buy your heat, when I go hike today and hike around my farm  
**[1:01:40-1:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:01:40):**  with my kids and get pictures of them climbing trees and doing other fun stuff and we cut  
**[1:01:46-1:01:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:01:46):**  up wood for firewood, nobody takes a cut thankfully at this point and that's a big thing you need  
**[1:01:54-1:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:01:54):**  to begin to understand is self-production, you don't lose 20 to 30% of your labor to  
**[1:02:02-1:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:02:02):**  taxes so you can live with less because it costs less to live.  
**[1:02:14-1:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:02:14):**  Oh yeah, I think it was Joel Salatin who also did the foreword for your book who talks about  
**[1:02:20-1:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:02:20):**  that a lot too, I've heard interviews with him, I've interviewed him for this show and  
**[1:02:24-1:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:02:24):**  the value of something that doesn't have to go through intermediaries, be processed through  
**[1:02:29-1:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:02:29):**  governments and just for doing it the way that they set up is more than just the value  
**[1:02:35-1:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:02:35):**  of what you might get paid for the time, it's also without all of those extra gleanings  
**[1:02:42-1:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:02:42):**  from the system when you just do it for yourself.  
**[1:02:45-1:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:02:45):**  Yeah, everybody has a hand in the cookie jar so all this is a problem.  
**[1:02:49-1:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:02:49):**  Oh man, I'm learning that here in Spain too, I'm all for having some sensible government  
**[1:02:56-1:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:02:56):**  programs and I think it's fantastic that they have single-payer healthcare and so many other  
**[1:03:00-1:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:03:00):**  services and reasonable costs for education but then you also realize just how robust  
**[1:03:06-1:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:03:06):**  the bureaucracy is too and I can see how people can criticize it from both sides, there's  
**[1:03:13-1:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:03:13):**  tons of benefits but there's a lot of compromises that you get with those as well.  
**[1:03:17-1:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:03:17):**  Yeah, it's a new system to get used to.  
**[1:03:20-1:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:03:20):**  Oh, I'm sure I just could not imagine what it would be like going from Guatemala to Spain.  
**[1:03:28-1:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:03:28):**  And that was after South Korea, Australia, I mean I haven't really lived in the United  
**[1:03:34-1:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:03:34):**  States for almost 15 years, I've made a few stops to do some work, like I used to work  
**[1:03:41-1:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:03:41):**  in shipping as an engineer and stuff but I've mostly lived abroad and like just getting  
**[1:03:45-1:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:03:45):**  used to new systems every time.  
**[1:03:48-1:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:03:48):**  Oof, it's exhausting, I'm really hoping that this is the last place I try and put down  
**[1:03:53-1:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:03:53):**  roots.

**[1:04:00-1:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:04:00):**  what we were able to cover of course in this podcast, I really encourage people to pick  
**[1:04:04-1:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:04:04):**  up the book but before you go, can you tell us a little bit more about how people can  
**[1:04:09-1:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:04:09):**  reach out to you and learn about the other work you do like the Whole Life Buying Club,  
**[1:04:14-1:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:04:14):**  Stetter.com and the Stetter community that you help to cultivate and the other books  
**[1:04:18-1:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:04:18):**  that you have to offer.  
**[1:04:20-1:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:04:20):**  Yeah, so Whole Life, if you're in the Louisville area, Louisville, Kentucky in the States,  
**[1:04:28-1:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:04:28):**  the Buying Club is just Louisville Whole Life, we have a webpage on the internet, great community  
**[1:04:34-1:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:04:34):**  of 100, 150 families who just want to directly support farms, artisans and other businesses.  
**[1:04:44-1:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:04:44):**  So the Buying Club at its heart tries to cut out as many middlemen as possible when it  
**[1:04:52-1:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:04:52):**  comes to getting farmers, consumers and homesteaders to directly transact.  
**[1:05:01-1:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:05:01):**  So that's always been a lot of fun.  
**[1:05:05-1:05:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:05:05):**  One thing since you mentioned Joel, Joel and I just did a conference together called the  
**[1:05:12-1:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:05:12):**  Rogue Food Conference.  
**[1:05:15-1:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:05:15):**  So remind me, I'll drop you a note once the recordings are available from the event.  
**[1:05:20-1:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:05:20):**  Oh, fantastic.  
**[1:05:21-1:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:05:21):**  Yeah, it's still going to be a minute before this episode comes out.  
**[1:05:24-1:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:05:24):**  So if you send me links to those, I'll be sure to put them on the show notes for this  
**[1:05:27-1:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:05:27):**  episode as well.  
**[1:05:28-1:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:05:28):**  Right, yeah.

**[1:05:33-1:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:05:33):**  And it was all about creative strategies for farmers and those involved with food to get  
**[1:05:42-1:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:05:42):**  around the regulations that make it so hard, at least in the States, to be profitable and  
**[1:05:50-1:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:05:50):**  to directly interact with consumers and end users of stuff.  
**[1:05:56-1:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:05:56):**  So that's fun.  
**[1:05:57-1:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/creative-ideas-for-building-your-homestead-on-a-budget-with-john-moody/#t=1:05:57):**  And then my personal website is johnwmoody.com, so you can contact me there.

**[0:00:00-0:00:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:00:00):**  This is Regenerative Skills, the podcast helping you to learn the skills and solutions to create  
**[0:00:08-0:00:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:00:08):**  an abundant and connected future.  
**[0:00:10-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:00:10):**  I'm your host, Oliver Gautier.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:00:14):**  So I know there's a lot of buzz and interest around agroforestry and food forest these  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:00:18):**  days, but do you really know what the difference is between an orchard and a food forest?  
**[0:00:22-0:00:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:00:22):**  Or how to choose the right species for your climate and soil conditions?  
**[0:00:26-0:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:00:26):**  How about companion plants and the various strata of a forest?  
**[0:00:29-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:00:29):**  And if you're looking to make money and sell products, how can you make a business  
**[0:00:33-0:00:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:00:33):**  plan and calculate expenses and profit from a system that could take years to mature?  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:00:38):**  Luckily, my friend Jacob Evans and I will be covering all of that and more in our upcoming

**[0:02:05-0:02:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:02:05):**  Hey and welcome back everybody!  
**[0:02:08-0:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:02:08):**  As we continue this ongoing series on building strong communities, I wanted to take a step  
**[0:02:13-0:02:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:02:13):**  back and focus on the youngest members whose needs and considerations are often overlooked  
**[0:02:18-0:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:02:18):**  as adults take charge and make decisions.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:02:20):**  Of course, childhood education, especially nature reconnection and environmental knowledge,  
**[0:02:25-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:02:25):**  has come to the forefront of my thinking this year, especially since my sister and her three  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:02:30):**  little girls came to visit from where they live in Kuwait for the whole month of January.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:02:35):**  So going into this visit, I was really excited to spend some time with them after a two year  
**[0:02:39-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:02:39):**  absence during the pandemic and I started planning all kinds of activities for what  
**[0:02:43-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:02:43):**  we were calling Jungle School.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:02:45):**  Now, Jungle School was thought up as the time that I was going to set aside in the mornings  
**[0:02:49-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:02:49):**  to bring the girls outside and discover all the wonders of nature and the different forms  
**[0:02:53-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:02:53):**  of plant, animal, and fungal life that we have in this environment around me.  
**[0:02:57-0:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:02:57):**  The setting was perfect.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:02:59):**  Thanks to a connection that my partner has, we were able to put them up in a katalan masiya  
**[0:03:03-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:03:03):**  set in an organic hazelnut orchard where there's outdoor play areas and fruit trees and chickens  
**[0:03:08-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:03:08):**  and rabbits and even horse stables.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:03:11):**  I figured I got this.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:03:12):**  I mean, I used to work as a camp counselor at summer camps and at guest ranch and one  
**[0:03:17-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:03:17):**  of my first jobs was before and after school programs at an elementary school.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:03:22):**  I love working with kids and in the Zoom calls that I had before they came out, I got them  
**[0:03:26-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:03:26):**  all worked up about the upcoming adventures of Jungle School.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:03:30):**  You're probably thinking by now, Oliver, you're hyping this up a lot and it sounds like you're  
**[0:03:35-0:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:03:35):**  going to be setting us up for a big letdown.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:03:37):**  And that's actually not the case.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:03:39):**  All in all, things went incredibly well.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:03:40):**  The girls loved going out to feed our food scraps from the kitchen to the pig and pick  
**[0:03:45-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:03:45):**  leaves to feed to the rabbits.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:03:47):**  And the oldest girl Selma, who's six, ran around the orchard with me playing Harry Potter  
**[0:03:52-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:03:52):**  and hunting Voldemort.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:03:54):**  At the same time though, if I am being honest, a lot of the activities that I had planned  
**[0:03:58-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:03:58):**  and set up for outdoor activities were not a huge hit.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:04:02):**  The thing is, I could tell pretty quickly that some of them were really fun for a six  
**[0:04:06-0:04:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:04:06):**  year old while Ruan at three years old lost interest pretty fast or vice versa.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:04:11):**  Now Ruan could play constantly in a sand pit forever while Selma got bored and then a little  
**[0:04:16-0:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:04:16):**  cranky.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:04:18):**  Now all of this is to say, I got a renewed respect for the insight that it takes to plan  
**[0:04:23-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:04:23):**  nature activities for kids and the thoughtfulness that's required to guide them through environmental  
**[0:04:28-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:04:28):**  learning in a way that connects with young digital natives.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:04:32):**  Luckily for me and all the rest of us, there are some amazing resources out there that  
**[0:04:36-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:04:36):**  can help us out.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:04:37):**  And so I reached out to Jacob Rothenberg, the co-author and the author respectively  
**[0:04:42-0:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:04:42):**  of The Big Book of Nature Activities and The Book of Nature Connection.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:04:47):**  Both of these titles focus on unique ways that Jacob has learned to engage children  
**[0:04:51-0:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:04:51):**  and adolescents with the wonders and science of nature.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:04:55):**  Jacob is the executive director at Camp Co'Artha, an award winning summer camp and outdoor education  
**[0:05:01-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:05:01):**  center which uses music, drama, hands on exploration, games and activities and more to inspire awe  
**[0:05:07-0:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:05:07):**  and wonder for the local environment.

**[0:05:36-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:05:36):**  In this interview, Jacob and I unpack the myriad reasons why it's so important for  
**[0:05:40-0:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:05:40):**  children to learn to connect with nature at an early age and the potential consequences  
**[0:05:45-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:05:45):**  of Nature Deficit Disorder if they don't.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:05:48):**  We start by exploring ways to get kids outside in the digital age and to inspire them to  
**[0:05:53-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:05:53):**  connect with the outdoors through their own unique motivations.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:05:57):**  From there we go into activities for kids at different ages and development stages,  
**[0:06:01-0:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:06:01):**  different sensory activities that help to connect beyond just seeing, and fun activities  
**[0:06:05-0:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:06:05):**  for different seasons during the year.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:06:08):**  Jacob also shares with me some of his own learnings and observations from decades of  
**[0:06:12-0:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:06:12):**  working in environmental education for kids, and his personal favorite games and projects  
**[0:06:16-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:06:16):**  to encourage young people to develop their own love for the natural world.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:06:21):**  I had so much fun with this interview and I came away with a ton of great ideas for  
**[0:06:25-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:06:25):**  when my nieces come to visit me next time.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:06:28):**  And also know that for those of you who are interested in checking out the two books that

**[0:06:42-0:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:06:42):**  own copy.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:06:43):**  So with that all out of the way, I'll hand things over now to Jacob Rotenberg.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:06:49):**  First of all, how did you get started with working with younger people, children and  
**[0:06:53-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:06:53):**  adolescents and teaching them and guiding them through reconnection through activities  
**[0:06:58-0:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:06:58):**  in nature?  
**[0:06:59-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:06:59):**  That's a very good question.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:07:01):**  I think I can credit my parents and growing up as a wild child, which meant in those days,  
**[0:07:07-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:07:07):**  I was kicked outside and left to romp and explore.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:07:11):**  And what a wonderful gift that was.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:07:13):**  I think for my parents, it was more just to get us out from under their feet.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:07:17):**  For me, it meant being able to go and explore wetlands, climb trees, build forts, just being  
**[0:07:23-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:07:23):**  out every day in this beautiful natural area that I happen to be lucky to live next to.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:07:29):**  And so over the years, I think that helped to build a strong relationship between myself  
**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:07:35):**  and nature and wanting to share that joy with other people.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:07:40):**  How do you feel like that turned into a career path?  
**[0:07:43-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:07:43):**  Because I myself worked in after school programs and summer camps, some of which had more of  
**[0:07:48-0:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:07:48):**  a nature focused experience and others were more kind of like gym based activities or  
**[0:07:53-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:07:53):**  what you would think of as gym classes from elementary school.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:07:58):**  What made you go into the nature advocacy and education reconnection experience route?  
**[0:08:05-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:08:05):**  Interesting.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:08:06):**  I think I can credit to a program called Patimivac.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:08:10):**  So when I was 17, at the end of high school, I applied to this wonderful program.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:08:16):**  And I got accepted.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:08:17):**  And then I thought about it and said, Dad, you know what, I want to go to university.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:08:21):**  And he said, kid, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity you should go.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:08:25):**  And I said, no, I want to go to university.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:08:29):**  But luckily for me, my father has strong personality.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:08:31):**  He said, you go.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:08:33):**  So with tears in my eyes, he put me on the train.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:08:36):**  And up I went to rural Quebec.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:08:38):**  And in Patimivac, the idea is you provide community service in several communities across  
**[0:08:44-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:08:44):**  Canada.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:08:45):**  You live with some French Canadians, you live with people from more privileged, less privileged  
**[0:08:50-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:08:50):**  backgrounds, and you learn to work together.  
**[0:08:52-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:08:52):**  So I think from that, just engaging in different activities with youth, I began to value teaching  
**[0:09:00-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:09:00):**  and value what youth could do, and thought that later on, maybe that's something I could  
**[0:09:06-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:09:06):**  pursue.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:09:07):**  It's funny, because I think I would have studied English.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:09:11):**  That's a really unique story.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:09:12):**  Usually it's parents that are pushing you towards higher education first and kids advocating  
**[0:09:17-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:09:17):**  for the other side.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:09:18):**  That's amazing that you had that experience when you did.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:09:22):**  And then it backfired because when I came back, I didn't want to go to university.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:09:26):**  And I think my dad was a bit frustrated at that.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:09:28):**  And I went on to become a group leader for Patimivac for a few years, one year in Red  
**[0:09:32-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:09:32):**  Lake in Northern Ontario, another year in Yellowknife.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:09:36):**  And those are just wonderful experiences.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:09:37):**  Oh, man, I've only seen pictures from up in that area.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:09:40):**  It looks really beautiful.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:09:42):**  What were some of the formative experiences that you had there that you later brought  
**[0:09:46-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:09:46):**  into your work?  
**[0:09:48-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:09:48):**  We went winter camping up in Thunder Bay.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:09:52):**  And how cool was that when it was minus 30, minus 40.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:09:56):**  In those days, Patimivac had an affiliation with the military, so we were able to borrow  
**[0:10:00-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:10:00):**  military winter camping equipment for free.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:10:04):**  And we survived a few nights.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:10:06):**  We built a quincy, we made fires, we made tea.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:10:10):**  It was just a beautiful experience.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:10:12):**  And then, you know, being in touch with nature, even when it wasn't the most friendliest,  
**[0:10:19-0:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:10:19):**  when temperature was that cold, I don't know, it was lovely.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:10:22):**  This is becoming a more and more rare experience, especially for the younger generation.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:10:29):**  And maybe you could talk a little bit about what you refer to as nature deficit disorder,  
**[0:10:35-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:10:35):**  and the effect that it's having on children these days.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:10:38):**  Yeah, that's a wonderful phrase that was coined by Richard Louvre.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:10:42):**  And he doesn't mean it in the medical sense.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:10:44):**  But what he does say is that kids need nature as part of a healthy childhood.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:10:50):**  And if you withdraw experiences in the natural world from children, and they begin to view  
**[0:10:56-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:10:56):**  the natural world as an alien landscape, they become scared of it.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:11:00):**  And then they spend most of their time indoors.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:11:02):**  And it's kind of ironic, isn't it, that we try to teach kids about the rest of the world  
**[0:11:06-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:11:06):**  from the confines of four walls.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:11:09):**  We don't think about this.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:11:10):**  There is this thing called outdoor education.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:11:13):**  But you know, conversely, there's this thing called indoor education.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:11:15):**  And that's what we engage in.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:11:17):**  And how sad it is that there's a beautiful world, a few steps right outside the door  
**[0:11:23-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:11:23):**  that our kids aren't exploring.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:11:25):**  And when they're spending so much time, the average is about eight hours a day in front  
**[0:11:29-0:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:11:29):**  of a glowing screen.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:11:31):**  What are they not doing?  
**[0:11:32-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:11:32):**  They're not experiencing what I call their neighborhood, their natural community.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:11:38):**  In truth, we live in a place that has buildings, houses, and people.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:11:43):**  But it also is the living systems that nourish us.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:11:46):**  And if we don't come into regular contact with that, and we're missing a big piece of  
**[0:11:50-0:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:11:50):**  life, then how are we going to care for something if we don't even know what it is, if we don't  
**[0:11:55-0:11:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:11:55):**  experience it, if it's not part of our milieu?  
**[0:11:59-0:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:11:59):**  So what I would love to do is to teach kids that the natural world is part of their community.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:12:06):**  And it's so full of wonderful stories from the little chickadee that at this time of  
**[0:12:11-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:12:11):**  year is calling out madly for its name.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:12:15):**  Speedy!  
**[0:12:17-0:12:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:12:17):**  To the squirrels and the chipmunks that are busy trying to find mates as well.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:12:22):**  There's an explosion of life that happens in spring.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:12:24):**  And, you know, just to share that joy, it's so important.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:12:29):**  It's strange how this is no longer normal when it has been throughout all of human history.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:12:35):**  What were some of the contributing factors that have made it a common thing to educate  
**[0:12:41-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:12:41):**  children indoors and the concept of outdoor education and nature connection to be an extracurricular  
**[0:12:48-0:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:12:48):**  almost as an optional thing that is not as necessary as it clearly is?  
**[0:12:53-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:12:53):**  Yeah, I think a lot of it has to do with liability concerns that principals are worried that  
**[0:12:58-0:13:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:12:58):**  it's dangerous out there, that children are going to get abducted or they're going to  
**[0:13:03-0:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:13:03):**  get bitten.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:13:05):**  And sadly, you know, we think about risk tolerance.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:13:10):**  Most of us hop into a car every day.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:13:12):**  There's probably a one in 80 chance that we'll get into an accident sometime in our lives.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:13:17):**  Or, you know, stairs, every 10 minutes, someone falls down stairs and hurts themselves in  
**[0:13:23-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:13:23):**  North America.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:13:24):**  And yet we tolerate that.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:13:26):**  But when it comes to going outside, the chances of actually something happening are very slim.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:13:31):**  But the opportunities there are so wonderful from, you know, playing, just using natural  
**[0:13:38-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:13:38):**  materials, for example, a stick.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:13:41):**  The organic forms of nature invite creativity and creative thought.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:13:46):**  You know, that stick becomes a magic wand or the mass of a ship or it could become a  
**[0:13:50-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:13:50):**  sword or it could become the pillar of a castle.  
**[0:13:55-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:13:55):**  And allowing kids to play in nature activates their imagination and creativity in a way  
**[0:14:00-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:14:00):**  plastic toys could never do.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:14:02):**  And when you're playing together in nature, then what happens?  
**[0:14:06-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:14:06):**  Well, you learn to cooperate, learn to problem solve.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:14:10):**  You just learn to imagine.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:14:12):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:14:13):**  And it seems like the first step, of course, is getting kids outside.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:14:18):**  And it seems like the easiest thing in the world, depending on who your kids are.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:14:21):**  I know it was not a challenge for my parents, even growing up in Minnesota with like six  
**[0:14:27-0:14:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:14:27):**  months of winter, we were rushing to get outside all the time.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:14:31):**  But with digital stimuli, the screens, the video games and all of the other toys now  
**[0:14:37-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:14:37):**  that are, I don't know, it seems like they're designed to suck all of our attention.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:14:45):**  And it's hard for the more simplistic things out in nature to compete with such constant  
**[0:14:50-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:14:50):**  information and sensory overload.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:14:53):**  What are some of the steps that you've taken to help kids to get outside as something that  
**[0:14:58-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:14:58):**  isn't looked at as a chore or sometimes a punishment, like go outside, you're being  
**[0:15:03-0:15:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:15:03):**  too rambunctious?  
**[0:15:04-0:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:15:04):**  Yeah, one of the things I've been loving to do lately is practicing sensory awareness  
**[0:15:10-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:15:10):**  activities.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:15:11):**  Because if you think about it, when you're hunched over a computer screen, everything  
**[0:15:14-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:15:14):**  squeezed into two dimensions, hermetically sealed, you're only activating your sense  
**[0:15:19-0:15:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:15:19):**  of sight and your sense of hearing, but those other senses are missing.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:15:24):**  In fact, some people have called it sensory anesthesia.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:15:28):**  That our senses are designed to connect us fulsomely to the natural world.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:15:34):**  And I believe that if kids aren't activating their senses, if they're not in nature, they're  
**[0:15:40-0:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:15:40):**  missing a piece, a feeling of belonging to something bigger.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:15:44):**  And maybe that's contributing to a sense of loneliness they have, because they don't feel  
**[0:15:48-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:15:48):**  like they're part of the life systems that nourish us all.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:15:52):**  So some of the sensory activities I might do is we might go and do a little scratch  
**[0:15:58-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:15:58):**  and sniff.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:15:59):**  We're rubbing the surfaces of moth, we're smelling a handful of earth, we're rubbing  
**[0:16:03-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:16:03):**  the different evergreen needles from pine, to fir, to spruce, and just picking up those  
**[0:16:07-0:16:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:16:07):**  different aromas.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:16:08):**  We might create a little smell cocktail, where we take a little smidgen of earth, a few snippets  
**[0:16:13-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:16:13):**  of pine needles and fir needles, a bit of grass, and we create these little smell cocktails  
**[0:16:20-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:16:20):**  and we share and we give it a name.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:16:22):**  Or you might take an empty frame, you know, and even just if you flip one hand up, flip  
**[0:16:26-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:16:26):**  the other hand the other way, you're isolating a piece of nature and you're looking at it  
**[0:16:30-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:16:30):**  in a unique perspective.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:16:33):**  But an empty frame, like an empty cardboard frame, you can take some clothespins and hang  
**[0:16:37-0:16:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:16:37):**  it up somewhere and get a beautiful view of nature.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:16:41):**  Or you might just take your two hands, cup them together, put them behind your ears and  
**[0:16:46-0:16:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:16:46):**  really listen.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:16:47):**  I mean, some people are so good that they can recognize the sounds of different trees  
**[0:16:52-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:16:52):**  as the wind tosses their branches just by the sound alone, like the whooshing of a white  
**[0:16:57-0:17:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:16:57):**  pine or the chattering of an aspen.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:17:02):**  Other things I love doing is just exploring.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:17:05):**  I remember once taking my kids to this beautiful overlook.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:17:11):**  We hiked, oh, it must have been an hour to get to the top.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:17:14):**  I was sweating and I was taking it all in, you know, lakes sparkling in the distance.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:17:20):**  I could see the tops of trees.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:17:23):**  And my kids were hiked down looking at ants.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:17:26):**  And that's because, especially kids, smaller kids have a contracted view of the environment.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:17:31):**  But if you can harness that, create little micro trails.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:17:35):**  So you take a popsicle stick and you poke it down in something that's interesting.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:17:39):**  So it might be next to a chewed leaf.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:17:42):**  And you have a little bit of yarn and you wrap around the popsicle stick and you go  
**[0:17:45-0:17:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:17:45):**  to the next spot, which might be a small hole right next to a tree.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:17:50):**  You go to the next spot, which might be this interesting rock.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:17:52):**  And you create a small micro trail and go follow it with a magnifying glass.  
**[0:17:57-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:17:57):**  Just paying attention to the very small.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:17:59):**  Or basement windows, which is you lift up a rock and you peer underneath.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:18:03):**  And I'll say to the kids, hey, do you want to see a baby dragon or maybe a shape shifter?  
**[0:18:11-0:18:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:18:11):**  Or maybe you want to see an earth boring submarine?  
**[0:18:14-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:18:14):**  And of course, what those are, the earth boring submarine is an earthworm.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:18:17):**  The shape shifter is a little pill bug that curls up into a ball.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:18:20):**  And the baby dragon is a salamander.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:18:23):**  But these are ways just to help kids wander and really be amazed at all the stories that  
**[0:18:28-0:18:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:18:28):**  are there in the natural world.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:18:31):**  If I heard you correctly, most of the examples that you gave were for younger children.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:18:36):**  And what are some of the ways that adolescents and teenagers can start to engage their senses  
**[0:18:43-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:18:43):**  in all of the different interactions that can happen in the natural world?  
**[0:18:48-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:18:48):**  One of the things I love doing with older kids is just even traditional skills or survival  
**[0:18:53-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:18:53):**  skills.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:18:54):**  Making a bow drill fire, making a fort.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:18:57):**  Just even I play a game called the lost game.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:19:01):**  Where we're in an open field.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:19:03):**  I blindfold someone and ask them to walk into a straight line to a pylon that might be 50  
**[0:19:09-0:19:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:19:09):**  meters away.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:19:10):**  But invariably, they begin to curl off because one leg is stronger than the other.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:19:15):**  Or the landscape bounces you.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:19:17):**  And I use that as a way to say, well, the wilderness and you're thinking you're walking  
**[0:19:21-0:19:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:19:21):**  in a straight line, the landscape will bounce you all over and you'll get lost and disoriented.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:19:25):**  So I show them simple ways of keeping a straight line.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:19:28):**  You know, that's you look at one spot in the distance where you are, you turn your head  
**[0:19:33-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:19:33):**  and find another, make sure they're in a straight line.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:19:35):**  And then you go to that next spot.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:19:37):**  And that way you won't be curling.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:19:41):**  But yeah, and the other thing we love doing is just vigorous physical activity, going  
**[0:19:45-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:19:45):**  for a vigorous hike, canoeing.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:19:50):**  And then as kids get older yet, you know, I know children today are really concerned  
**[0:19:56-0:19:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:19:56):**  about the state of the environment.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:19:58):**  And there is a word called ecophobia, which means those problems from climate change to  
**[0:20:04-0:20:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:20:04):**  species depletion to pollution to overpopulation.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:20:08):**  They're quite overwhelming.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:20:09):**  And as a kid, you're saying, well, what the heck am I supposed to do with that?  
**[0:20:13-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:20:13):**  You know, and you almost get scared into apathy.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:20:18):**  But by showing that just planting a little garden right next to where you are, small,  
**[0:20:26-0:20:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:20:26):**  local steps that help to activate and empower youth.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:20:30):**  That's so important.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:20:31):**  And everybody can do something and the act of doing something is in itself empowering.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:20:36):**  Well, I couldn't agree more.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:20:39):**  Now, let's dive even deeper into this level of activities and engagement for children  
**[0:20:45-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:20:45):**  of different development levels.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:20:47):**  So you know, at different ages, children connect with nature in different ways, a different  
**[0:20:52-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:20:52):**  growth and development stages.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:20:54):**  How can you use this knowledge to help select activities that each age group will really  
**[0:20:59-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:20:59):**  engage with?  
**[0:21:00-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:21:00):**  Interesting.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:21:01):**  So one of the things that the organization I work for, Camp CORE, has done is we created  
**[0:21:06-0:21:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:21:06):**  something called the Pathway to Stewardship and Kinship.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:21:09):**  So people want to look that up.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:21:12):**  And what we've done is we have funding to figure out what what is the key seminal experience  
**[0:21:17-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:21:17):**  that every child needs, the time they're born to the time they graduate from high school,  
**[0:21:22-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:21:22):**  to be an engaged steward.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:21:24):**  And we define stewardship as someone who cares for each other and cares for the land.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:21:29):**  So little kids, really, it is focusing on sensory awareness.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:21:34):**  But as kids get older, it's almost like ever widening fields of self.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:21:40):**  When you're younger, you're focused more on your own needs.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:21:43):**  But as you get older, you recognize you're part of the society.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:21:47):**  And then as you get older, yet you recognize you're part of the bigger world.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:21:51):**  And it's finding those activities that are age appropriate through each age and stage  
**[0:21:55-0:21:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:21:55):**  of a child's development.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:21:56):**  So yeah, middle aged kids love to explore.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:22:01):**  So if you're eight, nine, ten, that's a very evocative age and children are curious.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:22:08):**  And part of the way as a parent or an educator, you could help to spur that curiosity on is  
**[0:22:15-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:22:15):**  something I called hosing the leaf.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:22:18):**  So you ask every child to grab a leaf and hold it in their hands and stand next to a  
**[0:22:23-0:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:22:23):**  partner who also is holding a leaf.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:22:26):**  And you say, I don't know if you ever heard of Sherlock Holmes, but Watson, who was Sherlock  
**[0:22:31-0:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:22:31):**  Holmes' sidekick, would always say, Watson, how is it you figure it out?  
**[0:22:35-0:22:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:22:35):**  The answers to those mysteries.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:22:37):**  And Holmes would say, my dear Watson, you see, but you do not notice.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:22:44):**  So then in the spirit of Sherlock Holmes, each person looks at their leaf and they start  
**[0:22:49-0:22:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:22:49):**  with a statement, I noticed that.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:22:52):**  I noticed that this leaf is different colors on both sides.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:22:56):**  I noticed that this leaf has more pronounced veins on the back.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:23:00):**  I noticed that the leaf has pointy edges or an insect's been chewing it.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:23:04):**  What do you notice?  
**[0:23:05-0:23:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:23:05):**  And the next thing after that is, I wonder, I wonder why this leaf is green.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:23:12):**  I wonder why it fell off the tree.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:23:14):**  I wonder what insect ate this leaf.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:23:18):**  And really, if you think of the engine of learning is curiosity.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:23:21):**  So as a parent, as an educator, if we can harness that curiosity and really help kids  
**[0:23:27-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:23:27):**  to ask those wonder questions.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:23:30):**  At the very end of this exercise, you can also say, huh, it reminds me of, well, this  
**[0:23:36-0:23:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:23:36):**  leaf reminds me of the fact that spring is coming and new leaves will be forming.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:23:42):**  This leaf reminds me that, well, eventually it'll fall into the soil.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:23:48):**  It'll decompose and help other things to grow.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:23:50):**  So that sequence from observing to wondering to thinking about relationships really helps  
**[0:23:58-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:23:58):**  kids feel more connected to the natural world around them.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:24:02):**  I love that because one of the things that I often talk about on this show is the process  
**[0:24:07-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:24:07):**  of observation of nature and learning how to read a landscape.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:24:11):**  And it can be hard to develop those skills if you don't have much reference or training  
**[0:24:14-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:24:14):**  from doing it when you were younger.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:24:17):**  And in developing this observational skill, it's almost exercising like a muscle.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:24:22):**  It trains your eyes to notice things and distinguish different life forms, different stages of  
**[0:24:28-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:24:28):**  development, different interaction patterns.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:24:32):**  And I can imagine this leads to an overall feeling of more familiarity and less foreignness  
**[0:24:39-0:24:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:24:39):**  from the environment around you.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:24:42):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:24:44):**  And those wonder questions and those curiosity questions are so important.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:24:50):**  And as parents and as educators, we can either shut it down or we can encourage it.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:24:54):**  So often I've heard a parent say, oh, Johnny, put that down.  
**[0:24:57-0:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:24:57):**  That's gross.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:24:58):**  A spider, yuck.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:25:00):**  But if you can just bite your tongue and say, that's really interesting.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:25:04):**  Huh?  
**[0:25:05-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:25:05):**  I wonder what kind of spider that is.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:25:06):**  Maybe we should go look it up.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:25:08):**  By showing an interest, you're cultivating that sense of curiosity and legitimizing what  
**[0:25:14-0:25:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:25:14):**  that kid is feeling.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:25:17):**  The more that you can spur that on and encourage it, the better.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:25:19):**  And the more a child will wonder.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:25:22):**  And you don't need to know the answers to it.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:25:24):**  You just need to make the effort to find out more.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:25:27):**  And for every one answer, it opens up a whole myriad of new questions.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:25:31):**  And really, if you think about it, too, you know, the traditional nature educator was  
**[0:25:37-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:25:37):**  very encyclopedic.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:25:39):**  You'd walk around and you say, oh, yeah, I'll look at that.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:25:42):**  It's an elm tree and over here, yes.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:25:45):**  So they'd be labeling.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:25:47):**  But that's not the way our brains work.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:25:49):**  Our brains are designed to listen to stories.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:25:51):**  For thousands upon thousands of years, that's the way knowledge was transmitted.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:25:57):**  So it's better when we're in nature to take something like a cedar tree and find out what  
**[0:26:03-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:26:03):**  is the story of that cedar tree.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:26:05):**  Like it grows in alkaline soil.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:26:07):**  It's wood is rot resistant.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:26:09):**  It's a great place for animals to live.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:26:12):**  You know, you can make a tea because it's rich in vitamin C. So dive more deeply find  
**[0:26:16-0:26:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:26:16):**  out the story, the character of that particular thing.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:26:20):**  Which brings me to another point, too.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:26:22):**  And that is the tendency of all of us to really think of nature as a resource that only exists  
**[0:26:28-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:26:28):**  for human consumption, instead of, you know, thinking about it as a living entity that  
**[0:26:34-0:26:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:26:34):**  has a right to exist.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:26:37):**  And what you can do is animate the landscape.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:26:41):**  So my wife, Jessica, who runs a Waldorf based school, she's really good at that.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:26:47):**  So the kids will go out to, let's say, Grandfather Rock, or Heart Tree.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:26:53):**  And by using these names, she begins to give the land personality and imbue it with a bit  
**[0:26:57-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:26:57):**  of spirit.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:26:59):**  And kids connect more deeply that way.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:27:02):**  So and if you go to the same spots, over and over again, you're starting to build a relationship  
**[0:27:09-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:27:09):**  with that piece of land.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:27:10):**  Let's think about the language of relationship, right?  
**[0:27:14-0:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:27:14):**  When you have a relationship with somebody, it takes intention, mindfulness, hard work,  
**[0:27:21-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:27:21):**  commitment.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:27:23):**  Those same things can apply to a piece of land too, right?  
**[0:27:27-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:27:27):**  Intimacy of going over and over again, of practicing reciprocity and gratitude and thanks.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:27:32):**  We can do that as parents.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:27:34):**  We can help kids to get really intimately acquainted with a piece of land.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:27:38):**  So they learn to love it.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:27:39):**  You know, and by loving it, they'll want to learn more.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:27:42):**  Really, you know, there's a wonderful quote, which says, knowledge without love will not  
**[0:27:49-0:27:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:27:49):**  stick.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:27:50):**  So if we want kids to protect the environment, love the environment, then they have to be  
**[0:27:55-0:27:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:27:55):**  in it and develop a relationship with it.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:27:59):**  The First Nations, where I am right now, it's the Anishinaabe, Ojibwe, and they have this  
**[0:28:07-0:28:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:28:07):**  beautiful word called Anakinah, which means all my relations.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:28:11):**  So their view of nature is that it's part of their family, the sky, the earth, the soil,  
**[0:28:17-0:28:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:28:17):**  the plants, the insects, the birds.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:28:20):**  Wouldn't it be nice if we too could practice relating to nature in that fulsome way?  
**[0:28:28-0:28:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:28:28):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:28:29):**  And it seems like one of the progressions of going on that story, that journey with  
**[0:28:34-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:28:34):**  the environment that you live in, is seeing its progression through different seasons  
**[0:28:39-0:28:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:28:39):**  and its transformations.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:28:40):**  And I know you've got some wonderful activities for each of the major four seasons.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:28:45):**  Can you talk about how interaction may change or opportunities might evolve through the  
**[0:28:53-0:28:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:28:53):**  transformation over time?  
**[0:28:55-0:29:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:28:55):**  Yeah, I'll just say a few of my favorite activities for each season of the year.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:29:01):**  And hopefully, excuse me, resonate with your listeners.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:29:06):**  I love doing mushroom prints in the fall, so that you harvest the cap of a mushroom,  
**[0:29:13-0:29:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:29:13):**  you place it on a piece of paper, and you put a glass over it, leave it for 24 hours.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:29:17):**  And what will happen is the spores will fall off and make this beautiful mushroom print.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:29:23):**  And that's the way that people who study mushrooms identify mushrooms.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:29:27):**  So you can make mushroom prints.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:29:29):**  Whether it's in the fall, or even in the spring, but fall works.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:29:34):**  You take a clothespin and you put your name on it.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:29:37):**  Just write your name on the top of the clothespin and clip it to a leaf.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:29:41):**  And then go to that same leaf every day for the next three, four weeks and just watch  
**[0:29:47-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:29:47):**  how it changes over time.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:29:48):**  Because you don't really notice that.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:29:50):**  But if you focus on one small piece, you can really see how quickly it changes, how it  
**[0:29:55-0:29:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:29:55):**  changes color, it shrivels.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:29:58):**  You could even do nature sculpting.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:30:02):**  All you have to do is search Andy Goldsworthy online.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:30:05):**  Now he is this beautiful artist that hails from Britain.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:30:10):**  He goes out into the natural world and only using his hands, he creates these beautiful  
**[0:30:16-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:30:16):**  sculptures.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:30:17):**  So he might pin leaves together using thorns and drape them and watch as the sunlight sort  
**[0:30:23-0:30:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:30:23):**  of sparkles through.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:30:25):**  He might take different shaped rocks and make really neat patterns.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:30:29):**  He always takes a picture of it and then he lets nature reclaim it.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:30:34):**  So if you take a look at his pictures, you'll get inspired to do some nature art.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:30:39):**  Now I'm always careful about making sure that we practice reciprocity, which means if we're  
**[0:30:45-0:30:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:30:45):**  going to ever be taking something from nature, we give more back.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:30:49):**  So I'll sprinkle wildflowers, seeds, maybe plant a tree.  
**[0:30:55-0:31:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:30:55):**  The operating principle is you always give more than you take.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:31:00):**  In the wintertime, you might follow animal tracks.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:31:05):**  Remember every animal that walked by in the snow left a story behind.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:31:10):**  So you can ask, well, where was the animal going?  
**[0:31:14-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:31:14):**  Often leave a scuff mark at the back of its print.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:31:17):**  Was it walking?  
**[0:31:18-0:31:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:31:18):**  Was it running?  
**[0:31:19-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:31:19):**  Was it eating?  
**[0:31:20-0:31:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:31:20):**  What was it doing?  
**[0:31:21-0:31:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:31:21):**  What are the shape of its footprints?  
**[0:31:24-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:31:24):**  And if you followed for a bit, you can almost imagine what that animal was doing.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:31:28):**  You can catch a snowflake in the winter.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:31:31):**  All you do is you take a black piece of Bristol board, laminate it if you can.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:31:36):**  If not, just make sure it's cold.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:31:38):**  And when it's gently snowing outside, maybe minus five, catch a snowflake and look at  
**[0:31:44-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:31:44):**  it with a magnifying glass.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:31:45):**  You'll see beautiful stellar dendrites, maybe hexagonal plates.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:31:50):**  But you'll be amazed at how beautiful these crystalline structures are.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:31:54):**  If you want a challenge in the winter, you can take a little yogurt container and fill  
**[0:31:59-0:32:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:31:59):**  it with hot water.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:32:01):**  And then try to make a nest and see if you can keep that container warm.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:32:05):**  Come back in a few hours and see how you did.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:32:08):**  And then remember, that's how animals survive the winter.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:32:12):**  In the spring, I love teaching people about fishing.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:32:16):**  If you're in the woods and you hear a chickadee calling, chickadee, starting this sound.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:32:25):**  Birders call it pishing.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:32:27):**  And it makes chickadees and nuthatches and kinglets pretty curious.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:32:32):**  And they'll come up close.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:32:33):**  I've had as many as 60 chickadees almost with an arm's fling as I'm fishing.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:32:39):**  Or you might just listen to the different frogs that are starting to sing in the spring.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:32:46):**  You've got the bullfrog, you've got the green frog, or the toads.  
**[0:32:54-0:33:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:32:54):**  You go to frogwatch.ca, you can learn those different songs and go to a wetland, put your  
**[0:33:00-0:33:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:33:00):**  ears on those cup hearing and see if you can figure out what kind of frogs are calling.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:33:06):**  You can actually report that citizen science.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:33:10):**  In the summer, you might think about fireflies and calling them in.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:33:16):**  If you have a little indigo watch, you can mimic the pattern that fireflies make and  
**[0:33:22-0:33:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:33:22):**  attract them.  
**[0:33:24-0:33:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:33:24):**  Or you can look for insects pond dipping.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:33:29):**  Take a net from the dollar store, dip it in the ooze of a pond and maybe you'll find an  
**[0:33:35-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:33:35):**  underwater jaw-thrusting bug snatcher, a baby dragonfly.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:33:41):**  They live in the mud and they have this labium that unfolds to catch their prey.  
**[0:33:46-0:33:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:33:46):**  There's all kinds of wonderful critters that are hidden from view in a pond that are so  
**[0:33:51-0:33:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:33:51):**  worth seeing.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:33:52):**  Those are just a few activities and many more in the book, but I hope that helps.  
**[0:33:58-0:33:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:33:58):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:33:59):**  Man, my imagination is going wild and not only about other things that I could find  
**[0:34:04-0:34:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:34:04):**  around these new environments that I constantly get to see, but also with memories from my  
**[0:34:09-0:34:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:34:09):**  childhood and how much I would have loved to do similar things.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:34:14):**  I didn't have many people to actually show me around and teach me.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:34:18):**  A lot of it was just self-education and exploring with my friends, although there's certainly  
**[0:34:23-0:34:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:34:23):**  nothing wrong with that either.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:34:25):**  You mentioned something that I really want to dive deeper into and that's that concept  
**[0:34:29-0:34:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:34:29):**  of reciprocity because I think it's so important not only to see the outdoors as something  
**[0:34:33-0:34:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:34:33):**  that we go out to observe, but develop relationships and ways of interacting in order to deepen  
**[0:34:40-0:34:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:34:40):**  the connection.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:34:42):**  If ever I have a message that I want to convey, it's this.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:34:47):**  People are talking about sustainability and sustaining.  
**[0:34:52-0:34:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:34:52):**  That word implies a steady state, but it doesn't suggest that things will get better.  
**[0:34:56-0:34:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:34:56):**  It will only stay the same.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:34:59):**  If we want things to get better, we have to go beyond sustaining.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:35:04):**  The word that I'm loving these days and the word that I would like people to think about  
**[0:35:08-0:35:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:35:08):**  is regenerative.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:35:09):**  It's part of this podcast, right?  
**[0:35:12-0:35:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:35:12):**  That means that if you take a corner of your backyard and you plant shrubs and wildflowers  
**[0:35:20-0:35:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:35:20):**  and bushes that bear berries and put in butterfly houses, it's amazing how much life you can  
**[0:35:26-0:35:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:35:26):**  attract even to a small spot.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:35:31):**  In environmental education, we're always talking about mitigating harm.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:35:34):**  Let's do better than that.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:35:35):**  Let's do more good.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:35:37):**  Let's see if we can bring nature back.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:35:40):**  In a way, we practice nature apartheid, don't we?  
**[0:35:42-0:35:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:35:42):**  We create these cities with massive amounts of concrete and relegate nature to over there.  
**[0:35:47-0:35:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:35:47):**  It's time to bring nature back and we can do that.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:35:50):**  We can infuse nature in our built spaces both inside and outside by creating butterfly gardens,  
**[0:35:56-0:36:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:35:56):**  by having native plant species, by even having plants inside.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:36:02):**  But the more that we make nature proximate and right there, the more we'll love and interact  
**[0:36:08-0:36:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:36:08):**  with it and the more we'll value it.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:36:11):**  And certainly these concepts are not just for kids or adolescents.  
**[0:36:14-0:36:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:36:14):**  How can adults use these activities for their own reconnection with nature?  
**[0:36:19-0:36:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:36:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:36:20-0:36:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:36:20):**  So I think we're all born to yearn to connect to nature and that once we start doing that,  
**[0:36:28-0:36:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:36:28):**  practicing sensory awareness, exploring, just going for walks, the more we will feel connected  
**[0:36:35-0:36:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:36:35):**  to something bigger than ourselves, the more we will feel less alone and more nourished.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:36:41):**  So every day, get a bit of vitamin N, vitamin nature.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:36:46):**  The dab will do you.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:36:47):**  It doesn't have to be long, but just sitting in a park and really activating all your senses  
**[0:36:54-0:36:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:36:54):**  at once.  
**[0:36:55-0:36:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:36:55):**  What does this place smell like?  
**[0:36:57-0:36:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:36:57):**  What do I see?  
**[0:36:58-0:37:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:36:58):**  What do I hear?  
**[0:37:00-0:37:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:37:00):**  Try to get outside of yourself and into the world around you and drink it in through the  
**[0:37:04-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:37:04):**  magic of your senses.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:37:07):**  I think you'll feel in a way less lonely and more complete.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:37:12):**  And what advice do you have for people who are looking to take on an educator or a guidance  
**[0:37:16-0:37:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:37:16):**  role in helping others, especially children, to begin to reconnect in this way?  
**[0:37:22-0:37:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:37:22):**  Yeah, I think it starts with just taking kids outside.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:37:26):**  It starts with building that intimacy with place and then thinking about, well, here  
**[0:37:31-0:37:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:37:31):**  we are.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:37:33):**  What can we do to make this place richer?  
**[0:37:36-0:37:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:37:36):**  What would seven generations say from now about how we're caring for this space?  
**[0:37:41-0:37:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:37:41):**  Would they approve of what we're doing?  
**[0:37:44-0:37:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:37:44):**  And what would seven generations back say about what we're doing?  
**[0:37:48-0:37:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:37:48):**  So what small acts can we engage in that will make this space more nature rich, more beautiful,  
**[0:37:56-0:37:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:37:56):**  more vibrant?  
**[0:37:57-0:38:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:37:57):**  And maybe it just starts with a tiny, small few wildflowers.  
**[0:38:02-0:38:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:38:02):**  And each year you build on that.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:38:05):**  But that's the question that we need to ask.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:38:07):**  Can we do more good than harm?  
**[0:38:09-0:38:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:38:09):**  Can we make this place better?  
**[0:38:10-0:38:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:38:10):**  Now, I'm also curious about some of the things that you personally have learned over your  
**[0:38:16-0:38:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:38:16):**  own years and experiences in observations and working with so many students.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:38:24):**  I've learned that kids love to engage in activities and exploring.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:38:30):**  So I don't have to know tons.  
**[0:38:34-0:38:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:38:34):**  I just have to give kids the chance to explore.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:38:37):**  So we'll take exploration dice, and what that is is wooden blocks I've created.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:38:43):**  Six sides, I'll put all the six directions on one block.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:38:47):**  And on the other, I'll put a number like 6, 12, 10, 24.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:38:51):**  And we'll roll the dice and I'll say, okay, northwest 24.  
**[0:38:56-0:39:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:38:56):**  So we'll all turn northwest and we'll take 24 paces and then we'll hunker down.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:39:02):**  And at our feet, we'll discover something.  
**[0:39:05-0:39:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:39:05):**  It might be a spider's web.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:39:06):**  It might be a hole in the ground.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:39:08):**  But this bounces us around the landscape to places we never would have gotten to.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:39:13):**  And it just shows that everywhere you step, there's something to discover.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:39:17):**  So yeah, what have I learned?  
**[0:39:19-0:39:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:39:19):**  I've learned that kids are born explorers, and I just need to let them explore.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:39:24):**  I have also learned that the more I know about nature, the more I know nothing at all.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:39:28):**  I'm in kindergarten.  
**[0:39:29-0:39:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:39:29):**  I'm in awe of my friend Drew, who I wrote the big book of nature activities with.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:39:36):**  He is a consummate naturalist.  
**[0:39:38-0:39:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:39:38):**  And those are so few and far behind.  
**[0:39:40-0:39:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:39:40):**  So if you go for a walk with Drew, it'll take you maybe an hour to go 100 meters, because  
**[0:39:46-0:39:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:39:46):**  he just knows so much about everything.  
**[0:39:48-0:39:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:39:48):**  And what I love, it's embodied knowing.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:39:51):**  He doesn't have to abdicate his knowing to a device and look something up.  
**[0:39:55-0:39:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:39:55):**  It's there in his head, and it's there in his heart.  
**[0:39:58-0:40:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:39:58):**  There's something more powerful about that way of knowing that comes from years of experience  
**[0:40:03-0:40:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:40:03):**  that's deep inside of him, and that really is beautiful.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:40:09):**  And so, seeing as we're in kind of a reconnection stage, right, this is to imply that we are  
**[0:40:15-0:40:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:40:15):**  not very well connected right now, what vision for a more reconnected future do you think  
**[0:40:21-0:40:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:40:21):**  that we can reach?  
**[0:40:23-0:40:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:40:23):**  So right now, I'm really inspired by the work of someone who created the concept of a living  
**[0:40:32-0:40:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:40:32):**  building.  
**[0:40:33-0:40:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:40:33):**  His name is Jason McClellan.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:40:36):**  And Jason McClellan is an architect, grew up in Ottawa, and eventually moved to the  
**[0:40:41-0:40:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:40:41):**  States.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:40:42):**  And he once looked at a tree and he said, just by virtue of being there, that tree does  
**[0:40:49-0:40:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:40:49):**  more good than harm.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:40:51):**  It uptakes carbon, it gives out oxygen, it aerates the soil, it provides food to animals  
**[0:40:57-0:40:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:40:57):**  and insects.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:40:59):**  It's beautiful.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:41:00):**  Why can't a building be like that?  
**[0:41:03-0:41:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:41:03):**  So he created this idea that buildings can actually do good on the landscape.  
**[0:41:10-0:41:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:41:10):**  So we've created a building called the Camp Kawartha Environment Center that embodies  
**[0:41:13-0:41:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:41:13):**  many of those principles.  
**[0:41:15-0:41:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:41:15):**  So like a tree, it produces more energy than it uses.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:41:19):**  It's made out of non-toxic materials that when it's useful life is over, like a tree,  
**[0:41:24-0:41:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:41:24):**  it will return to the soil.  
**[0:41:26-0:41:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:41:26):**  There's more nature in and around the spot the building occupies than before the building  
**[0:41:30-0:41:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:41:30):**  was built.  
**[0:41:31-0:41:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:41:31):**  It has its position to receive solar power, so it produces more energy than it uses.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:41:40):**  It's passive solar, meaning in the wintertime sun streams in and helps to heat the building.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:41:46):**  There's so many principles there that we can learn from.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:41:49):**  So if we can build in a way which aligns with the principles of nature, of cycling, of producing  
**[0:41:58-0:42:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:41:58):**  more energy, of actually having more nature in and around our built spaces, that's the  
**[0:42:05-0:42:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:42:05):**  answer.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:42:06):**  That's what we need to be doing.  
**[0:42:07-0:42:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:42:07):**  And when kids see this, they really are motivated and empowered by that notion that people and  
**[0:42:14-0:42:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:42:14):**  nature can share the same spot so that both can thrive.  
**[0:42:19-0:42:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:42:19):**  Look, Jacob, I can tell that you're inherently a very curious and inquisitive person.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:42:25):**  I'm wondering what you're inspired by or working on or developing at the moment.  
**[0:42:30-0:42:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:42:30):**  What are you looking forward to?  
**[0:42:32-0:42:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:42:32):**  Yeah, so we're working on the Pathways to Stewardship program where we have over 40  
**[0:42:39-0:42:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:42:39):**  organizations involved, the university, the college, and we're trying to make sure that  
**[0:42:44-0:42:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:42:44):**  kids get those important stewardship experiences throughout their development.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:42:49):**  I think that's a model that we're sharing to other jurisdictions.  
**[0:42:53-0:42:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:42:53):**  We're also doing Eco-Mentor programming.  
**[0:42:56-0:43:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:42:56):**  So we have a special program that trains teachers and developing teachers on how to take students  
**[0:43:05-0:43:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:43:05):**  outside in their school yard and what activities they can do there that are consistent with  
**[0:43:09-0:43:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:43:09):**  the curriculum that will help kids connect to nature.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:43:12):**  And just recently, this model has gone national online.  
**[0:43:17-0:43:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:43:17):**  So we're able to reach faculties of education across Canada.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:43:22):**  And we're also working with early childhood educators.  
**[0:43:26-0:43:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:43:26):**  But really, I think we need to build and live in a new way, which brings nature back.  
**[0:43:33-0:43:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:43:33):**  That excites me, the whole idea of being regenerative, of doing more good than harm.  
**[0:43:38-0:43:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:43:38):**  And if I have a role to play in helping with that, I'd be very happy.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:43:44):**  That concept, that idea really resonates with me as well.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:43:46):**  It's part of what this podcast is based around aiming to do.  
**[0:43:51-0:43:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:43:51):**  And I really think that we need to explore more how to intervene and inspire the younger  
**[0:43:56-0:44:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:43:56):**  generation so that they can take on the work that is going to be otherwise very insurmountable  
**[0:44:03-0:44:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:44:03):**  without their help.  
**[0:44:05-0:44:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:44:05):**  What are some of the biggest roadblocks that you see?  
**[0:44:08-0:44:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:44:08):**  What are some of the biggest challenges that you're working to overcome in that regard?  
**[0:44:11-0:44:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:44:11):**  Yeah, I think it's just the sheer amount of time the kids are spending inside in front  
**[0:44:16-0:44:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:44:16):**  of computers.  
**[0:44:17-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:44:17):**  And I'm not dissing computers.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:44:19):**  They're a valuable tool, but like any tool, you need to learn to use it properly.  
**[0:44:25-0:44:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:44:25):**  So the easiest way to counteract that is to help teachers and parents recognize the value  
**[0:44:32-0:44:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:44:32):**  of being outdoors, connecting with nature.  
**[0:44:36-0:44:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:44:36):**  And if we can train parents and educators to be the gatekeepers, to open up the doors  
**[0:44:41-0:44:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:44:41):**  to nature and to bring nature inside, I think that will go a long way to helping kids care  
**[0:44:47-0:44:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:44:47):**  for this earth that we all share.  
**[0:44:49-0:44:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:44:49):**  Amazing and I feel like I had cut you off there just before I asked this last question.  
**[0:44:53-0:44:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:44:53):**  Was there something else that you wanted to say?  
**[0:44:55-0:45:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:44:55):**  Oh, I was just thinking about the idea of agency, empowerment and hope.  
**[0:45:01-0:45:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:45:01):**  And that is you don't want to give a kid a problem they don't have the ability to solve  
**[0:45:06-0:45:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:45:06):**  for the aids that they're at.  
**[0:45:08-0:45:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:45:08):**  In fact, everything you do hopefully inspires kids to want to do more.  
**[0:45:14-0:45:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:45:14):**  So think carefully before you start talking about climate change and how dire that all  
**[0:45:22-0:45:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:45:22):**  is.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:45:23):**  Instead, it starts with developing a close and intimate relationship with nature.  
**[0:45:29-0:45:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:45:29):**  And really climate change is a symptom of our broken relationship to nature.  
**[0:45:34-0:45:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:45:34):**  We're doing what we're doing to the earth because we really have not had a good relationship  
**[0:45:39-0:45:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:45:39):**  with natural systems.  
**[0:45:40-0:45:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:45:40):**  And we're not thinking about how to care for the world that we're living in.  
**[0:45:44-0:45:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:45:44):**  We wouldn't be doing these things if we had a fulsome connection to nature.  
**[0:45:49-0:45:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:45:49):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:45:50-0:45:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:45:50):**  And look, Jacob, I feel like there are still a lot of things that you're touching on here  
**[0:45:56-0:45:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:45:56):**  that we could explore for a long time.  
**[0:45:59-0:46:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:45:59):**  But how can others get in touch with you and learn more about the programs and this pathway  
**[0:46:05-0:46:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:46:05):**  to stewardship and kinship program especially?  
**[0:46:08-0:46:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:46:08):**  Yeah, so they can just search pathways to stewardship and kinship and it'll take them  
**[0:46:13-0:46:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:46:13):**  to a website.  
**[0:46:15-0:46:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:46:15):**  And there's just tons of resources.  
**[0:46:16-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:46:16):**  There's videos that are going through each of what we call the landmarks.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:46:21):**  So for every age and stage, there's a key experiences I was talking about.  
**[0:46:25-0:46:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:46:25):**  And it shows activities you can do for that age.  
**[0:46:28-0:46:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:46:28):**  There's a wonderful guide and we're really inspired by First Nations ways of knowing  
**[0:46:33-0:46:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:46:33):**  and we've tried to weave that into the pathways to stewardship and kinship.  
**[0:46:37-0:46:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:46:37):**  I love when people email me and ask me questions or tell me what they're doing so they can  
**[0:46:42-0:46:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:46:42):**  reach me, jacob.canpkawartha.ca.

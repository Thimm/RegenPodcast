**[0:02:27-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:02:27):**  We've got an unusual episode today.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:02:29):**  Neil is taking over the interviewer spot and he's speaking with someone who I didn't know  
**[0:02:34-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:02:34):**  at all before this but has quite a name in Irish culture.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:02:38):**  You want to tell us a little bit about this interview?  
**[0:02:40-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:02:40):**  Yeah, I really enjoyed this one.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:02:43):**  I talked to Dermot Ling today who's actually pretty famous in Ireland.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:02:48):**  He was a really great hurler with Wexford.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:02:50):**  We're the same age actually.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:02:53):**  So I remember him from his playing days and he then moved into commentary and analysis  
**[0:02:57-0:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:02:57):**  but Dermot's gotten really into Irish culture, Irish mythology, the Irish language and he  
**[0:03:04-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:03:04):**  wrote a really great article recently which we're going to post a link to on the website  
**[0:03:08-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:03:08):**  about the shifting of the Irish mindset and CosmoVision if you will.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:03:16):**  And he links it to concepts in Irish mythology which would be familiar to some not to others  
**[0:03:22-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:03:22):**  about how this battle, this famous battle that took place in Irish mythology between  
**[0:03:27-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:03:27):**  the Four Morians and the Tuatha Dé Danann.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:03:28):**  And Tuatha Dé Danann were the guardians of this mindset that was all about living in  
**[0:03:35-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:03:35):**  harmony with the natural world contrasted to the Four Morian mindset which is all about  
**[0:03:40-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:03:40):**  extraction and reductionism.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:03:43):**  Really interesting article.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:03:44):**  So he's a person who's working very much in the mainstream Irish culture.  
**[0:03:50-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:03:50):**  He commentates on sports matches but he's also really calling for the sporting community  
**[0:04:00-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:04:00):**  to go back to their roots to start planting ash trees again which is suffering greatly  
**[0:04:06-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:04:06):**  from ash dieback and a very important tree both ecologically and culturally to the Irish  
**[0:04:12-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:04:12):**  people.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:04:13):**  He's running retreats with his partner in an area of Ireland where Irish is still spoken  
**[0:04:17-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:04:17):**  as the first language.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:04:19):**  They run the retreats in Gaelic and help people to reconnect to their own culture but also  
**[0:04:24-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:04:24):**  link it to things like foraging for medicinal plants and doing yoga and some kind of more  
**[0:04:31-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:04:31):**  Eastern spiritual practices.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:04:33):**  So doing some really interesting stuff back in Ireland and yeah it was really enjoyable  
**[0:04:38-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:04:38):**  interesting conversation.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:04:39):**  I hope you enjoy it.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:04:40):**  And how do you tie these concepts in with permaculture?  
**[0:04:43-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:04:43):**  Yeah well for me I guess permaculture as Dave Jackie says is about cultivating ecological  
**[0:04:49-0:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:04:49):**  culture which in a lot of senses you can come at this in different ways but in a lot of  
**[0:04:55-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:04:55):**  senses for me this is about changing the way we see the world and a lot of the time when  
**[0:05:01-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:05:01):**  we change the way we see the world how we interact with it kind of is naturally changes  
**[0:05:07-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:05:07):**  as a result of that.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:05:08):**  So what Dermot is calling for in his articles and in the stuff he's talking about is that  
**[0:05:13-0:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:05:13):**  we shift how we see the world.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:05:17):**  So I think you'll see more about that when you listen or you'll hear more about that  
**[0:05:21-0:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:05:21):**  when you listen to the article.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:05:22):**  Marvelously I got a whole lot out of this conversation as well and I'll leave links  
**[0:05:26-0:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:05:26):**  in the show notes to this episode for both the article that Dermot wrote as well as the  
**[0:05:30-0:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:05:30):**  homepage for the Gaelic Games if anybody is looking to learn more about hurling as a sport.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:05:36):**  So I'll hand things over now to Neil Hagerty and Dermot Ling.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:05:40):**  All right how are you doing everybody?  
**[0:05:41-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:05:41):**  I'm here joined today by Dermot Ling a fellow countryman.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:05:47):**  We're both ex-hurlers.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:05:48):**  Dermot played to a much higher standard than I did and if you don't know what hurling is  
**[0:05:53-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:05:53):**  don't worry we're going to explain that.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:05:56):**  Dermot I reached out to because he wrote a fantastic article that we're going to publish  
**[0:06:00-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:06:00):**  on the website called Silver Branch Perception which to me is all about seeing the world  
**[0:06:06-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:06:06):**  in a different way which in my opinion is what is goes to the essence of what permaculture  
**[0:06:12-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:06:12):**  is all about and even though he doesn't consider himself a permaculturalist a lot of the things  
**[0:06:17-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:06:17):**  Dermot talked about in that article and a lot of the things we've talked about in the  
**[0:06:21-0:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:06:21):**  few conversations we've had since I reached out to him really touch on permaculture ideas.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:06:26):**  So we're just going to have a chat and see where it goes.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:06:29):**  Dermot delighted to have you with me.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:06:31):**  Yeah it's good to be on Neil it's good to be on we've been back and forth a good bit  
**[0:06:35-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:06:35):**  and you know you're busy and I suppose I'm a little bit busy at the moment too and so  
**[0:06:40-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:06:40):**  to make the time for the chat is yeah it's good.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:06:45):**  Neil Art is great and do you know what I can hear  
**[0:06:48-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:06:48):**  myself my Irish accent is coming back.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:06:50):**  Dermot Yeah yeah yeah it's always gassed when people  
**[0:06:54-0:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:06:54):**  get together from their own place you hear it we spend time here with people from outside  
**[0:06:59-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:06:59):**  you know and when you talk to them it's all very clear and easy but if something else  
**[0:07:06-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:07:06):**  comes out of us when we're talking to fellow countrymen we just get a little bit crazy.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:07:10):**  Neil Absolutely absolutely the boys I mean to see  
**[0:07:12-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:07:12):**  when I came out I had a conversation with you on the phone yesterday and then I came  
**[0:07:15-0:07:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:07:15):**  out to talk to my friends and I said well lads what's the craic and they were all looking  
**[0:07:20-0:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:07:20):**  at me going what?  
**[0:07:22-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:07:22):**  Dermot Yeah yeah yeah.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:07:23):**  Neil Sure I never say things like that anymore you  
**[0:07:26-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:07:26):**  know.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:07:27):**  Dermot Yeah yeah  
**[0:07:28-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:07:28):**  Neil I don't understand you but anyway Dermot why don't we start with you just giving people  
**[0:07:33-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:07:33):**  an explanation because we're going to talk about the game of hurling a bit and I'd imagine  
**[0:07:38-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:07:38):**  that a lot of our listeners will have no idea what that actually is so why don't you do  
**[0:07:42-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:07:42):**  your best to give us sort of an explanation to the layman of what this game we play is.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:07:48):**  Neil I will do hurling is in modern times a sport played similar to many other field  
**[0:07:58-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:07:58):**  sports with lines around the field and certain rules that are assisted by those by the lines  
**[0:08:06-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:08:06):**  and the shape and the goals and the nets and all of those things that sports have three  
**[0:08:13-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:08:13):**  points for a goal one point there's the details of the game and there's the way the game is  
**[0:08:18-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:08:18):**  played and then there's the game outside of the organization that owns and runs the game  
**[0:08:26-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:08:26):**  or considers itself maybe to own the game and I suppose there are deeper aspects to  
**[0:08:34-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:08:34):**  hurling that I have always been interested in.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:08:38):**  It starts off with us for Irish people it starts off in mythology hurling is from that  
**[0:08:45-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:08:45):**  time that Moriarty calls once upon a time time in our mythology where Coo Cullen was  
**[0:08:52-0:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:08:52):**  the original hurler and I definitely felt it as a six or seven year old reading that  
**[0:08:56-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:08:56):**  story of him leaving home to go to Owenmaka to join the warriors of the Red Branch Knights  
**[0:09:03-0:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:09:03):**  I felt he left Wexford you know I never it's rumored to be loud or elsewhere but in my  
**[0:09:09-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:09:09):**  mind he was always leaving Wexford and I walked every step of that journey and played in the  
**[0:09:14-0:09:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:09:14):**  games at Owenmaka in my own mind throughout my childhood and so that transfers then into  
**[0:09:23-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:09:23):**  the game but I definitely felt that with that deeper understanding of it it gave me an alignment  
**[0:09:31-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:09:31):**  with what I wanted to achieve in the game very very early and I never really considered  
**[0:09:38-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:09:38):**  that that wouldn't be the case you know when you set about meal planting and building your  
**[0:09:44-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:09:44):**  place you know okay you've got doubts and everything else along the way but you feel  
**[0:09:49-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:09:49):**  when you put something out there or feel something very very deeply that the world responds to  
**[0:09:53-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:09:53):**  you and makes it happen for you and that was how it was so I went up through the ranks  
**[0:10:00-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:10:00):**  of playing with my club you start off locally playing for your local area and the sport  
**[0:10:06-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:10:06):**  is very much rooted in the locality in representing your parish and your place in the positive  
**[0:10:12-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:10:12):**  that's a very good thing because you're representing your area and there's a pride and a power  
**[0:10:19-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:10:19):**  that comes with that power in the positive sense of energy but there can also be the  
**[0:10:26-0:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:10:26):**  you know you have to hate the bastards down the road and you have to try and kill them  
**[0:10:30-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:10:30):**  and you have to do all of this and that sometimes leads to a more negative version of what the  
**[0:10:35-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:10:35):**  game is so from the club level then you get selected to play for county level where you  
**[0:10:40-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:10:40):**  get to represent your county and your pagan third county in Ireland from about there's  
**[0:10:47-0:10:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:10:47):**  probably about 25 maybe hurling teams and well at the highest level and so I played  
**[0:10:54-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:10:54):**  with at that level with Wexford in a time when you were very dominant Cork were also  
**[0:11:01-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:11:01):**  very dominant.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:11:02):**  I remember it well.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:11:05):**  Yeah I do too unfortunately Neil but look at it yeah it was the same as anything that  
**[0:11:12-0:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:11:12):**  you do in your life it was an experience to learn from and I started to learn loads from  
**[0:11:19-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:11:19):**  it.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:11:20):**  And it a lot of the things I mean I got as far as club level and I dreamed of I think  
**[0:11:26-0:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:11:26):**  just like every young fella of going on to play for my county we're the same age actually  
**[0:11:30-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:11:30):**  I think we were both born in 1981 isn't that right?  
**[0:11:33-0:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:11:33):**  Yeah yeah yeah so if I'd been if I'd been a few steps faster and a bit tougher we might  
**[0:11:39-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:11:39):**  have played against each other but what club were you Neil?  
**[0:11:43-0:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:11:43):**  I played for a club called Inisgara we're an intermediate club we're an intermediate  
**[0:11:47-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:11:47):**  club in Cork sort of perennial underachievers really unfortunately but a fierce it is definitely  
**[0:11:58-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:11:58):**  a very how would I say it all the things you're talking about like the very intense I remember  
**[0:12:05-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:12:05):**  like breaking on to the the first team as I think I was 19 the first time I played for  
**[0:12:09-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:12:09):**  the intermediates and I had a kind of like the buzz and the excitement around it but  
**[0:12:14-0:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:12:14):**  also like the pressure that comes from being a young fella playing for the first team in  
**[0:12:18-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:12:18):**  your club is enormous you know.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:12:21):**  It is yeah yeah.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:12:23):**  But like I think it's a thing that it definitely hurling to me and Irish culture are sort of  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:12:30):**  really linked inexorably you know as you say like it goes from the mythology right up to  
**[0:12:35-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:12:35):**  the present day like every every town has the church and the GEA club in the center  
**[0:12:41-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:12:41):**  of it and I think it's a thing that's difficult to understand if you're not from Ireland but  
**[0:12:45-0:12:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:12:45):**  it really does go in a sense to the to the core of who we are and how we identify ourselves  
**[0:12:52-0:12:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:12:52):**  I think in a lot of ways which is one thing that you touched on in your article that was  
**[0:12:55-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:12:55):**  very interesting to me you know.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:12:57):**  So why don't you tell me Dermid how you went from because like I say I spent a lot of time  
**[0:13:02-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:13:02):**  in GEA dressing rooms and around and for all the good it has I definitely wouldn't say  
**[0:13:08-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:13:08):**  it fosters a mentality of introspection or or even mysticism.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:13:14):**  So why don't you tell me how you went from being a well-known famous hurler to being  
**[0:13:20-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:13:20):**  to being what you're doing now to being at what you're doing now.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:13:25):**  Well I played in I played in a in a game in 2007 a Leinster final for Leinster final you're  
**[0:13:33-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:13:33):**  talking maybe about time was Wexford v. Kenny probably 45, 50,000 and I got injured in that  
**[0:13:39-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:13:39):**  game and we were playing a couple of weeks later against the Prairie and it hurt my hamstrings  
**[0:13:44-0:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:13:44):**  so on medical advice I went into the cryotherapy chamber in Wexford which is a room that's  
**[0:13:50-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:13:50):**  minus 120 degrees and froze my body and I could get in for five minutes and froze my  
**[0:13:56-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:13:56):**  body in it and just couldn't function really very well after that I struggled to eat and  
**[0:14:03-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:14:03):**  sleep and drink and it went down so low maybe I don't know 15-20% of body functionality  
**[0:14:11-0:14:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:14:11):**  and then that began to climb slowly and maybe plateaued around 60 never really returned  
**[0:14:18-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:14:18):**  that vibrancy that I had previous to it.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:14:21):**  So I think that that I played on for three more years with a compromised system and a  
**[0:14:28-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:14:28):**  compromised mind and a compromised sense of the game as well and that I think led to falling  
**[0:14:37-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:14:37):**  out of love with the game I was no longer connected to the essence of it that I had  
**[0:14:42-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:14:42):**  been so I knew that exploration was required and so I left and I went to America and worked  
**[0:14:51-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:14:51):**  for a few months and saved up a few a few Bob and I met a guy from Chile playing in  
**[0:14:59-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:14:59):**  a game of soccer I used to play with a group of Mexicans who worked in the kitchen with  
**[0:15:06-0:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:15:06):**  us in the restaurant that I was working with and they used to play on a Wednesday night  
**[0:15:10-0:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:15:10):**  after work so I used to go and play with them foot taller and a big white pasty Irishman  
**[0:15:16-0:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:15:16):**  with all of these with every Mexican in New York in this big huge dome that we played  
**[0:15:22-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:15:22):**  soccer in and there was a Chilean guy there one day Sergio and I got chatting to him and  
**[0:15:27-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:15:27):**  we went down to the pub afterwards with a grove and a pint and there was I don't know  
**[0:15:32-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:15:32):**  20 or 25 people there but there was just one seat beside Sergio and I sat in beside him  
**[0:15:36-0:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:15:36):**  and he started talking about I was very I was very lost at the time I was very lost  
**[0:15:43-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:15:43):**  in New York very lost in myself very disconnected very uncertain about what was going on around  
**[0:15:50-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:15:50):**  me and he began to talk about presence and living in the moment meditation yoga Buddhist  
**[0:15:59-0:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:15:59):**  philosophy things that I had never yeah I had never heard of before articulated in a  
**[0:16:06-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:16:06):**  way that made so much sense and that was fine and I went about my day the following day  
**[0:16:12-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:16:12):**  and then I met a guy the following evening and he felt that I was I was down he was a  
**[0:16:17-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:16:17):**  yoga teacher actually was also an American a 40 year old second generation Irish who  
**[0:16:22-0:16:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:16:22):**  was playing football with us the fittest guy on the team because of all the yoga he was  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:16:26):**  doing and he said to me as well he was like look what you seem a little bit off are you  
**[0:16:31-0:16:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:16:31):**  alright and I explained to him a couple of things that were in on me and he started talking  
**[0:16:36-0:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:16:36):**  about awareness and presence and yoga and meditation as well and I thought geez that's  
**[0:16:44-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:16:44):**  a that's a weird one for the second night in a row and then the third night I did the  
**[0:16:48-0:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:16:48):**  litter the next night I picked up a book I think by Matthew Syed Malcolm Gladwell actually  
**[0:16:55-0:17:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:16:55):**  and the first page just contained the same message again and I knew well enough that  
**[0:17:03-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:17:03):**  yeah that I suppose messages when they come in threes like that three day one day after  
**[0:17:09-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:17:09):**  the other yeah I had to take up I had to listen so I spoke to Sergio and he was going to Southeast  
**[0:17:16-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:17:16):**  Asia to travel to go to a Buddhist temple for a while and I had I had South America  
**[0:17:22-0:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:17:22):**  on my mind and that's what I was saving up for but I said I think I need to follow this  
**[0:17:26-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:17:26):**  and so I went to South America or I went to Southeast Asia which with Sergio stayed in  
**[0:17:31-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:17:31):**  a temple for a month and then just travelled to the best of time and around the world but  
**[0:17:39-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:17:39):**  it was much more about how we travelled I would have done the Irish travel which would  
**[0:17:43-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:17:43):**  be three weeks in Southeast Asia, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, nine or ten months in a pub in Australia  
**[0:17:51-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:17:51):**  then three weeks in you know back home through LA, New York and then home and then be depressed  
**[0:17:57-0:18:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:17:57):**  if you were home because you never would have left.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:18:00):**  Because it's not as nice drinking pints in the rain as it is in the sun.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:18:04):**  Yeah yeah yeah and to shut your your your your bandai tan to show off as I thought I  
**[0:18:10-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:18:10):**  I probably would have done that to be honest with the mindset that I was in but he took  
**[0:18:15-0:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:18:15):**  me away from that and we travelled and we got up early to meditate and we ate very well  
**[0:18:22-0:18:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:18:22):**  on the road all the time and flew by the universal law of yeah things will just come to us if  
**[0:18:30-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:18:30):**  we put ourselves in the right position and so yeah yeah it's seven or eight months of  
**[0:18:35-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:18:35):**  that and that set me off on that set me off on a journey of of learning I suppose about  
**[0:18:42-0:18:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:18:42):**  um yeah I just about I Moriarty puts it very very very simply but very very well I think  
**[0:18:50-0:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:18:50):**  um I was seeking to explain me to me and that that's yeah that just continues now I suppose.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:18:58):**  And you had the courage to follow it?  
**[0:19:01-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:19:01):**  I don't know Neil people say that often because I mean I left I left Dublin I was working  
**[0:19:06-0:19:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:19:06):**  in news talk on a sports program called Off the Ball and that was like the most ideal  
**[0:19:12-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:19:12):**  job in sport like I mean to sit in a studio and talk about hurling and football and rugby  
**[0:19:16-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:19:16):**  or American football or whatever it was and get paid for it and I was working with SOAR  
**[0:19:22-0:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:19:22):**  this youth organisation who were running workshops with 15 to 16 year olds trying to connect  
**[0:19:29-0:19:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:19:29):**  them to their inner purpose all through the hero's journey based on Jim Stein's work with  
**[0:19:34-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:19:34):**  the Reach Foundation in Australia and so I was I was in I was I couldn't have been any  
**[0:19:41-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:19:41):**  better placed in a way and I found myself very close to the centre of a very very powerful  
**[0:19:46-0:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:19:46):**  movement of people in Dublin and I felt very blessed called them my friends and so that  
**[0:19:52-0:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:19:52):**  was just growing and growing but I could feel a dis-ease and a disharmony at the centre  
**[0:20:00-0:20:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:20:00):**  that just it was manifesting itself physically but I could feel it in my soul and I knew  
**[0:20:06-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:20:06):**  that I would end up hurting those people or I would end up not being able to honour what  
**[0:20:12-0:20:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:20:12):**  I what I understood mentally and intellectually but that I wasn't fully embodying and so I  
**[0:20:20-0:20:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:20:20):**  felt I had to leave the same as when I left hurling at 28 in my prime as captain I was  
**[0:20:25-0:20:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:20:25):**  like I have to I have to be if it wasn't the choice be like a bold choice to come down  
**[0:20:30-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:20:30):**  to West Kerry out on to the age of western civilisation it was like it made me as opposed  
**[0:20:38-0:20:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:20:38):**  I made it so but I see where it comes from and I do see the courage in it I suppose in  
**[0:20:44-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:20:44):**  hindsight because I still took the steps.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:20:48):**  Yep I know exactly what you mean it's really not that different from my own journey.  
**[0:20:54-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:20:54):**  In a lot of senses and I know exactly what you mean about the sense of feeling like the  
**[0:21:00-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:21:00):**  choice makes you you know.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:21:02):**  In terms of you ending up in Guatemala or.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:21:05):**  Absolutely yeah in terms of me stepping away from a nice safe position and a handy life  
**[0:21:11-0:21:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:21:11):**  and a good job and coming up to be a farmer in the mountains in Guatemala you know it  
**[0:21:18-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:21:18):**  like I say it was a series of choices then it's hard to say whether I made them or they  
**[0:21:24-0:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:21:24):**  made me you know.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:21:26):**  Yeah yeah yeah.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:21:28):**  But I want to get back to I want to start talking a little bit about the article you  
**[0:21:33-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:21:33):**  wrote you know because I loved in I love the way you weaved certain mythology into the  
**[0:21:41-0:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:21:41):**  into the modern into certain of the modern issues we're facing you know.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:21:48):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:21:49):**  And this idea of like silver branch perception versus the reducing I you know like mythologically  
**[0:21:56-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:21:56):**  that's very interesting to me in permaculture we talk Dave Jackie a famous permaculture  
**[0:22:01-0:22:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:22:01):**  list has a quote that says permaculture is about cultivating ecological culture you know  
**[0:22:08-0:22:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:22:08):**  and what he's actually talking about is like like the sort of world view of of our people  
**[0:22:15-0:22:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:22:15):**  needs to change in order for us to start treating the environment better it's not going to get  
**[0:22:20-0:22:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:22:20):**  there with a list of with a series of rules and decisions made in Brussels about what  
**[0:22:25-0:22:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:22:25):**  to plant and and and recycling it actually the the perception and the world view needs  
**[0:22:31-0:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:22:31):**  to change and it's you know it's something I talk about a lot at the especially at the  
**[0:22:35-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:22:35):**  start of courses.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:22:38):**  But the way you put it and and and it never occurred to me before of course the whole  
**[0:22:42-0:22:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:22:42):**  I've heard the stories of Lula, Fada and and Balor of the evil eye and all the rest of  
**[0:22:47-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:22:47):**  it but I had never actually made that connection you know.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:22:51):**  So maybe you could tell me a little bit about how you actually gained silver branch perception  
**[0:22:58-0:22:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:22:58):**  to put it that way.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:22:59):**  Yeah well I'll tell you I'll I'll be honest Neil I don't feel that I have it today.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:23:06):**  Of course.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:23:07):**  I feel I've fallen away from it and I'm suffering for that.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:23:13):**  But I came across it initially with John Moriarty and I would suggest for anybody to hear this  
**[0:23:20-0:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:23:20):**  have a look on you get a little small teaser of John Moriarty with Ami Tiernan on YouTube  
**[0:23:26-0:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:23:26):**  there's about a 12 minute video and you'll get a good sense of what he is then and if  
**[0:23:31-0:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:23:31):**  Yes I've watched those videos they're excellent.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:23:35):**  Yeah he'll you'll know very quickly whether it's something you follow or not but he was  
**[0:23:40-0:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:23:40):**  describing this idea of the the the Ann Cough Maitara on Darra Kian the second battle of  
**[0:23:51-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:23:51):**  Maitara and in that he pits the two of the Danan versus the Four Morians or history does  
**[0:24:00-0:24:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:24:00):**  and Moriarty takes it up as being the guardians which is what the two of the Danan were he  
**[0:24:07-0:24:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:24:07):**  feels the guardian of this this way of seeing the world now they're considered as a mythological  
**[0:24:12-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:24:12):**  race and they're considered as make believe and they're considered as a magical race and  
**[0:24:17-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:24:17):**  all of these things.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:24:18):**  What does the two of the Danan translate to Dermid?  
**[0:24:23-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:24:23):**  The Danu the goddess the Tuatha is either a people or an area of Danu and so that's  
**[0:24:45-0:24:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:24:45):**  where that's who  
**[0:24:47-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:24:47):**  Kind of like the people of the goddesses people sort of  
**[0:24:50-0:25:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:24:50):**  Yeah I suppose they were the race at the time who they were the prevalent race of Ireland  
**[0:25:08-0:25:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:25:08):**  a supernatural race I don't know where they are like they were a tribe where are they  
**[0:25:17-0:25:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:25:17):**  in our understanding of the world now in the in the Four Morian mindset that we've taken  
**[0:25:23-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:25:23):**  up where are the two of the Danan or where's the space for them I don't know but anyway  
**[0:25:30-0:25:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:25:30):**  they were the they were the they were the pre-christian pre-christian Ireland I suppose  
**[0:25:40-0:25:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:25:40):**  I suppose what you're saying you might even say kind of indigenous Irish people to put  
**[0:25:46-0:25:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:25:46):**  it that way  
**[0:25:48-0:25:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:25:48):**  Yeah yeah yeah this this is the thing about mythology I suppose Neil this is where mythology  
**[0:25:55-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:25:55):**  is I find probably most interesting is you've got the archetypes and you've got your mythological  
**[0:26:02-0:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:26:02):**  understanding of what's going on in terms of like this is where we are now and this  
**[0:26:08-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:26:08):**  is our way of understanding it by relating to the archetypes or to do deeper mythologies  
**[0:26:14-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:26:14):**  but I have some kind of there's some part to me that feels that that it's it's real  
**[0:26:23-0:26:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:26:23):**  like that it's still happening or the that it happened or a supernatural race but I don't  
**[0:26:29-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:26:29):**  know was it that it just they were in they were just in union like that they were in  
**[0:26:34-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:26:34):**  union before some kind of fall before we before we we fell in our in our ability to navigate  
**[0:26:44-0:26:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:26:44):**  this our home in our ability to see it and in our ability to work with it I mean what's  
**[0:26:50-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:26:50):**  magic and what's supernatural is very very there's a very very thin line for people who  
**[0:26:56-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:26:56):**  like it can happen at any time it happened to you with your goats in a way you know it's  
**[0:27:01-0:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:27:01):**  like when a knee cleanses itself and when you're in connection with your purpose when  
**[0:27:08-0:27:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:27:08):**  you're doing what you're supposed to be doing there is a there is a response from somewhere  
**[0:27:13-0:27:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:27:13):**  and things begin to things begin to flow and to fall in for you yeah so there's there's  
**[0:27:20-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:27:20):**  a magic to it essentially that's it and so a magic like we perceive magic to be this  
**[0:27:27-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:27:27):**  this this thing like it has its own little label and so little boxes what magic is but  
**[0:27:32-0:27:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:27:32):**  for something like the two of the down and when you go to it when I go to explain the  
**[0:27:35-0:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:27:35):**  two of the down and it's I'd like the same as Gocolin like it's it's make-believe and  
**[0:27:41-0:27:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:27:41):**  it's fiction and it's a fine story but it's not it happened and it's happening in me and  
**[0:27:46-0:27:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:27:46):**  the two of the down and versus the four more ian's are happening in me as well this is  
**[0:27:50-0:27:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:27:50):**  what Moriarty saw so you just to clarify in your what you talk essentially the two of  
**[0:27:58-0:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:27:58):**  the Danon versus the as I understood it from your article is it's the kind of battle between  
**[0:28:04-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:28:04):**  the eye that reduces everything to to functionality versus this eye that sees the sees the world  
**[0:28:13-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:28:13):**  as a paradise yes yes yeah that's it and the four more ian's led by Balor and he did it  
**[0:28:21-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:28:21):**  the evil eye the soul mildegook is the reducing I so that this is reduces the world to what  
**[0:28:27-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:28:27):**  it is what is measurable and to what is useful that we are that this is our Dominion and  
**[0:28:35-0:28:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:28:35):**  that we have control and that we exact our intentions and our purposes upon that which  
**[0:28:41-0:28:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:28:41):**  is already here which is already sentient which is already living and it doesn't allow  
**[0:28:45-0:28:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:28:45):**  us to see that in that mindset and the way the down and we're fighting to to essentially  
**[0:28:51-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:28:51):**  to defend that to defend Silverbrands perception this ability to see the liquid soul of life  
**[0:28:56-0:29:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:28:56):**  in everything and so I felt that to be arguing these things or to be thinking these things  
**[0:29:04-0:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:29:04):**  even to be allowed to think these things I had to experience I had to experience it and  
**[0:29:12-0:29:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:29:12):**  so not intentionally going down to experience it but I went down to West Cork to a retreat  
**[0:29:19-0:29:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:29:19):**  centre at Doge and Bear in West Cork and I spent about three weeks down there and I went  
**[0:29:26-0:29:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:29:26):**  off in the middle of it on my own little quest with a tent and they stood out for a couple  
**[0:29:31-0:29:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:29:31):**  of nights on a headland that was an unpopulated headland overlooking the sea and I just began  
**[0:29:41-0:29:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:29:41):**  to tune in a little bit more and tuned into myself and the second morning I was practising  
**[0:29:47-0:29:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:29:47):**  the Cheekong on the edge of the cliffs and I could feel something just shifted something  
**[0:29:54-0:29:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:29:54):**  changed and I can see it and feel it now but I don't know what it was but I could feel  
**[0:29:59-0:30:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:29:59):**  this energy source coming in from the outside it was like straight down my throat it was  
**[0:30:08-0:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:30:08):**  really really intensely powerful and I was thinking to myself right this is it now this  
**[0:30:12-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:30:12):**  is my of course looking for the pill always it's like okay this is it now this is the  
**[0:30:16-0:30:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:30:16):**  thing that's gonna fix me just get in there and fix me and then I caught myself doing  
**[0:30:21-0:30:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:30:21):**  that and kind of just stood back and said no no just go with it and I stayed in it  
**[0:30:25-0:30:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:30:25):**  for a little while longer and I looked down the cliff then and I felt I could see a nice  
**[0:30:30-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:30:30):**  easy climb down I could see a route and so I in in taught another communion with the  
**[0:30:39-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:30:39):**  mountain speaking away to it as I went down walked down the side of it not like it was  
**[0:30:45-0:30:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:30:45):**  a it was it was it wasn't something I would have done before it I'd say but it was I definitely  
**[0:30:50-0:30:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:30:50):**  found this route and I walked down and I got down to the bottom and it was about maybe  
**[0:30:57-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:30:57):**  a hundred meters or so and I got down to the bottom and I looked up to see and there was  
**[0:31:01-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:31:01):**  waves coming in and I could see straight across on the other side of the little outlet was  
**[0:31:07-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:31:07):**  a cave and it looked like a deep cave and I Campbell Joseph Campbell came to me immediately  
**[0:31:12-0:31:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:31:12):**  and it was like the the cave that you fear holds the treasure that you seek and so I  
**[0:31:18-0:31:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:31:18):**  flipped off and jumped in and and swam over into the cave and it opened up inside and  
**[0:31:27-0:31:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:31:27):**  I swam in I'd say 20 meters into the into the cliff and sat pulled myself up on a rock  
**[0:31:32-0:31:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:31:32):**  on the inside and sat there and looked out at yeah at the at the at the paradise that  
**[0:31:39-0:31:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:31:39):**  I now knew I was in and so this is this is this is Moriarty's this is Moriarty's journey  
**[0:31:46-0:31:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:31:46):**  this is what he journeyed towards it's to realize that this idea of paradise of this  
**[0:31:53-0:31:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:31:53):**  other place is is just an idea that when you actually let down that idea and let go of  
**[0:31:59-0:32:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:31:59):**  that idea that you actually come to the paradise that we are living in that we are currently  
**[0:32:04-0:32:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:32:04):**  in paradise and I yeah it was I suppose it cemented what I suspected and I was very grateful  
**[0:32:14-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:32:14):**  for the experience and as I said I feel a million miles away from it in some respects  
**[0:32:20-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:32:20):**  today because just a few things are going against me but but I felt it and I felt it  
**[0:32:27-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:32:27):**  when I was out on the Blasket Islands a couple of times too where I realized that nature  
**[0:32:30-0:32:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:32:30):**  was looking back at me while I was looking at nature again looking for the pill of healing  
**[0:32:36-0:32:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:32:36):**  I could feel nature looking back at me and I felt it coming in one evening on the water  
**[0:32:42-0:32:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:32:42):**  we'd go out and catch mackerel in the evenings on the island and there was only a couple  
**[0:32:48-0:32:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:32:48):**  of us staying there and we were out fishing and I was coming back in thinking about floating  
**[0:32:53-0:33:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:32:53):**  in on the sea and I had just been reading Thich Nhat Hanh and he was talking about how  
**[0:33:01-0:33:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:33:01):**  walking and well if you saw somebody walking on the sea you would proclaim it to be a miracle  
**[0:33:06-0:33:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:33:06):**  but yet we walk on the earth and if you take physics as is known like one is just a certain  
**[0:33:15-0:33:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:33:15):**  vibration and water is just another vibration and we're a vibration and that one supports  
**[0:33:20-0:33:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:33:20):**  us is the very same miracle as if it was the other one and that kind of blew my thinking  
**[0:33:24-0:33:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:33:24):**  away for a little while and then I was coming in on the boat the following evening and I  
**[0:33:28-0:33:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:33:28):**  could feel us floating in on in the Blasket Sound coming into the Traubahn and I crossed  
**[0:33:36-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:33:36):**  over into that world again I just I could see the sea I could see the life force that  
**[0:33:41-0:33:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:33:41):**  was the sea I could see the mountain at the back of the island and the farm are the mountain  
**[0:33:49-0:33:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:33:49):**  that looks like a dead man lying in the sea with the sun setting behind it to the west  
**[0:33:54-0:34:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:33:54):**  it was all just very very vivid and very very beautiful and so that yeah just those moments  
**[0:34:00-0:34:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:34:00):**  of crossover I suppose allowed me to realize that these things are there that's lovely  
**[0:34:06-0:34:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:34:06):**  to know but then it's then I guess what I feel is the value is once you make that deeper  
**[0:34:13-0:34:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:34:13):**  connection once you get to see it you get a chance to make a deeper connection and then  
**[0:34:18-0:34:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:34:18):**  you're more willing to defend it because you know what you're defending you're not defending  
**[0:34:21-0:34:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:34:21):**  a movement in your mind you're not defending an intellectual idea about what freedom is  
**[0:34:25-0:34:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:34:25):**  about what something else is you're you're defending something that's very very real  
**[0:34:30-0:34:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:34:30):**  and has and you know is ever present if you could just stay with it so yeah that was the  
**[0:34:36-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:34:36):**  that was where that all kind of I hope that interwove in some kind of a successful way  
**[0:34:43-0:34:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:34:43):**  that it makes sense because I know I jumped from from a couple of different things but  
**[0:34:47-0:34:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:34:47):**  that was yeah that was probably what spawned a lot of of my my reading and writings and  
**[0:34:53-0:34:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:34:53):**  talks about about Moriarty and and the Silver Branch.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:34:58):**  No I loved it I mean I'm I'm fighting back the tears to be honest with you Diarmuid because  
**[0:35:04-0:35:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:35:04):**  it was very similar to my own to a lot of the things that happened to me in different  
**[0:35:12-0:35:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:35:12):**  order I actually also went to Dogshan Beire I remember having these kind of vivid moments  
**[0:35:19-0:35:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:35:19):**  of of it's sort of loss of self usually along the edge of the sea as well sometimes along  
**[0:35:27-0:35:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:35:27):**  the edge of the lake here where I live in Guatemala but I think one of the things you  
**[0:35:30-0:35:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:35:30):**  said that definitely jumped out to me there is like there's no there it's not a pill you  
**[0:35:37-0:35:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:35:37):**  have these experiences and these moments of deep connection but you actually still have  
**[0:35:40-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:35:40):**  to go back to the real world with with all your baggage and all your old habits and all  
**[0:35:45-0:35:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:35:45):**  the rest of it and it's not like you just boom you become enlightened or boom you become  
**[0:35:50-0:35:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:35:50):**  a sort of a mystical medicine man or whatever it's it's it's more of yeah it's more of a  
**[0:35:57-0:36:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:35:57):**  thing that opens up the gates of perception but you do have it's sort of a bit of a habit  
**[0:36:03-0:36:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:36:03):**  to keep them open you know.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:36:05):**  Yeah that's it it is yeah there's more of a there's a minding that needs to be done  
**[0:36:10-0:36:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:36:10):**  and I suspect that's what I've slipped away from in the last.  
**[0:36:14-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:36:14):**  We all we all do.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:36:16):**  Yeah yeah.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:36:17):**  We all do.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:36:19):**  The other thing I wanted to say like you know I think like I say a lot of the reason I reached  
**[0:36:26-0:36:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:36:26):**  out to you is you you know you just touched on so many things that are so dear to me and  
**[0:36:32-0:36:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:36:32):**  and the thing about mythology you know is it's fascinating because like I often say  
**[0:36:37-0:36:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:36:37):**  to our our students that come here for permaculture courses is like what we're really trying to  
**[0:36:42-0:36:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:36:42):**  do in a sense in the permaculture movement or or really anyone who's kind of had one  
**[0:36:47-0:36:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:36:47):**  of these experiences that you're talking about dear midgets we're trying to ask answer the  
**[0:36:52-0:36:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:36:52):**  question of like what is ecologically appropriate behavior for humans how do we build a society  
**[0:36:59-0:37:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:36:59):**  that lives in harmony with nature and that not just in harmony but in symbiosis with  
**[0:37:05-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:37:05):**  nature you know.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:37:07):**  We actually don't have the answer to those questions there's there it's not like there's  
**[0:37:13-0:37:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:37:13):**  you know millions of people living off in some corner of Europe and they've just nailed  
**[0:37:18-0:37:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:37:18):**  it you know this is like a question that the whole species has to answer or or very quickly  
**[0:37:24-0:37:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:37:24):**  we're going to become extinct you know.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:37:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:37:27):**  But to me there's clues in mythology you know because I think you alluded to it it very  
**[0:37:33-0:37:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:37:33):**  much there it's like that loss of connection to the ecosystem that supports us you know  
**[0:37:43-0:37:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:37:43):**  to me that's that's been suffered by every people's by every people all over all over  
**[0:37:48-0:37:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:37:48):**  the world you know in some people some permaculture lists or ecologists would tell you that it's  
**[0:37:54-0:38:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:37:54):**  a loss that occurred when we when we switched from being kind of horticulturalists or or  
**[0:38:01-0:38:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:38:01):**  stewards of the forest into agriculturalists you know and yeah I definitely I love the  
**[0:38:08-0:38:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:38:08):**  story of of Tiernan Ogh in in in how it hints at that you know.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:38:15):**  Yeah when when Oisín comes back and he looks at you know he leaves as a hunter for sure  
**[0:38:21-0:38:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:38:21):**  right because the the Fianna are hunters and they're they they go into the forest and even  
**[0:38:28-0:38:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:38:28):**  his initiation of how Oisín joins the Fianna it's like all about like running through the  
**[0:38:33-0:38:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:38:33):**  forest after a after a hare without breaking a branch and without breaking a twig yeah  
**[0:38:39-0:38:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:38:39):**  yeah and also there's poetry in it you know he has to like recite all these poems and  
**[0:38:44-0:38:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:38:44):**  these stories as well and he comes back and as I remember that story as my as my dear  
**[0:38:51-0:38:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:38:51):**  sister told it has told it to me most recently like he comes back and all the forests are  
**[0:38:55-0:39:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:38:55):**  gone and it's all pasture land and the people are weak and they're small and they're malnourished  
**[0:39:00-0:39:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:39:00):**  actually because of course when we switch to like feeding ourselves from like monocultures  
**[0:39:08-0:39:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:39:08):**  essentially we we lose all that great nutrition that great diversity in our diet and and you  
**[0:39:14-0:39:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:39:14):**  know I also believe that the the ecosystem knows what we need so eating seasonally and  
**[0:39:21-0:39:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:39:21):**  like and and eating not just seasonally but wildly you know eating the things that the  
**[0:39:27-0:39:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:39:27):**  forest is providing that's your medicine and that's where the growth I think just just  
**[0:39:32-0:39:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:39:32):**  kind of happens you know so I think we're lucky in Ireland that we have still a connection  
**[0:39:39-0:39:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:39:39):**  to these to these myths and this old way of living even through hurling even if it has  
**[0:39:44-0:39:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:39:44):**  been changed a bit even if the mindset has shifted more towards a a formorian mindset  
**[0:39:50-0:39:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:39:50):**  you know so that's that's just my that's just my two cents on yeah no no there's a lot there's  
**[0:39:58-0:40:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:39:58):**  a lot in it there's a there's a lot in it you know it it's another aspect of of that  
**[0:40:06-0:40:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:40:06):**  of that perception in a way because I think to be a little bit wilder to be not so socialized  
**[0:40:15-0:40:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:40:15):**  when you eat the wild fruits and collect the wild plants and drink the wild teas I think  
**[0:40:21-0:40:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:40:21):**  you're inviting more and more of that in and I think that this idea of of of being socialized  
**[0:40:28-0:40:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:40:28):**  and playing our societal role where it is very very important in one's ends that we're  
**[0:40:33-0:40:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:40:33):**  able to function cohesively and that's never going to be a perfect model and that's and  
**[0:40:38-0:40:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:40:38):**  that's fine but at least stay in contact and at least to stay connected to the wild places  
**[0:40:47-0:40:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:40:47):**  I think that that's that's been very very beneficial to me definitely and when I look  
**[0:40:52-0:40:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:40:52):**  at observe people around me on a similar path they have reconnected with the wild because  
**[0:40:58-0:41:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:40:58):**  I think a lot of it a lot of it comes down to a distrust of nature it seems to be quite  
**[0:41:05-0:41:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:41:05):**  like muck you know is dirt and it's it's it's what comes if it comes straight from the ditch  
**[0:41:11-0:41:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:41:11):**  it's not washed and all of these things that we all know I suppose but it's it's it's in  
**[0:41:17-0:41:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:41:17):**  it's in doing it it's in it's in collecting it and I have to break these things down bit  
**[0:41:21-0:41:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:41:21):**  by bit my partner is very very strong on all of that and collects wild food all of the  
**[0:41:26-0:41:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:41:26):**  time and so I'm learning bit by bit and that's that was a challenge for me because I came  
**[0:41:33-0:41:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:41:33):**  from that from that mindset I came from that you know very a cleaner a sterilized what's  
**[0:41:42-0:41:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:41:42):**  that a kind of a sterilized culture I almost think a more sterilized culture for sure and  
**[0:41:50-0:41:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:41:50):**  that has been that has definitely been again it's it's very hard to say I feel a degree  
**[0:41:58-0:42:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:41:58):**  of contradiction because I don't feel quite in my power today but I do I do think I have  
**[0:42:06-0:42:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:42:06):**  definitely benefited greatly from that I could feel in myself this morning because I'm not  
**[0:42:13-0:42:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:42:13):**  maybe processing things so well at the moment I have a bit of a hurt how to learn what is  
**[0:42:20-0:42:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:42:20):**  our toloon in English a well known a well known plant that we make he arrow oh yeah  
**[0:42:30-0:42:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:42:30):**  oh yeah yeah yeah I plan to yeah we've a lot of it planted here actually have you well  
**[0:42:35-0:42:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:42:35):**  oh well our heart halloom which is father of the land is what yarrow translates as and  
**[0:42:43-0:42:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:42:43):**  so I was thinking to myself today like this is the masculine fruit of nature of Irish  
**[0:42:52-0:42:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:42:52):**  countryside and so I was thinking to myself that's it like you know it's the nettles are  
**[0:42:58-0:43:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:42:58):**  back again so that kind of points to a bit of a detoxing time because it's after the  
**[0:43:06-0:43:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:43:06):**  summer it's time to detox again and then maybe tune into my tune into the strength of the  
**[0:43:12-0:43:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:43:12):**  hour to learn of the arrow is it's probably time to that again too so trying to allow  
**[0:43:18-0:43:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:43:18):**  these things to guide to try and I've been looking this morning trying to understand  
**[0:43:24-0:43:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:43:24):**  the masculine in seven and to begin asking some of those questions of myself as well  
**[0:43:32-0:43:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:43:32):**  and understand a little bit more deeply for a deeper guidance because the guidance I'm  
**[0:43:36-0:43:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:43:36):**  giving myself definitely isn't working so it's just it's continuously constantly trying  
**[0:43:43-0:43:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:43:43):**  to tune into these things and allowing space for to ritual to ritually consume these things  
**[0:43:55-0:44:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:43:55):**  and to allow the space for it while also trying to build a shed outside and get polytunnel  
**[0:44:00-0:44:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:44:00):**  organized and all of those yes it's always good not to be you've to stay connected to  
**[0:44:06-0:44:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:44:06):**  the earth I think and stay connected to the sort of practical things definitely helps  
**[0:44:12-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:44:12):**  for sure I think it's great dear to be honest I love how honest you are about you know it's  
**[0:44:19-0:44:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:44:19):**  not flowing for you right now and I think that's very important you know because there's  
**[0:44:26-0:44:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:44:26):**  nothing worse than a fellow who who has one of these sort of spiritual awakenings and  
**[0:44:31-0:44:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:44:31):**  then goes around telling everyone he's enlightened you know there's really like why at least  
**[0:44:34-0:44:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:44:34):**  he I already did that I think it's a necessary step on the journey like that's it you come  
**[0:44:44-0:44:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:44:44):**  back with your bit of wisdom and you think you know you sort out everything you have  
**[0:44:50-0:44:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:44:50):**  to tell everyone the way it is as well that's what I know you do sure that goes yeah that's  
**[0:44:54-0:44:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:44:54):**  what's on the hand with it like you have to make a few people sick at the same time get  
**[0:44:58-0:45:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:44:58):**  up on it up on the soapbox and give a sermon every chance you get that's I was like that  
**[0:45:02-0:45:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:45:02):**  for a while yeah yeah oh yeah you do you really have to suffer these things and I it's because  
**[0:45:12-0:45:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:45:12):**  I've spent so much time Neil I think trying to explain me to me there's been a disconnect  
**[0:45:18-0:45:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:45:18):**  a disconnectedness with my with you know people around me maybe they're not as tuned into  
**[0:45:24-0:45:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:45:24):**  it as I as I feel I would should be and so I think that the other side of that is you  
**[0:45:35-0:45:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:45:35):**  have to share very very very openly and very bearingly what you do find if you're not going  
**[0:45:42-0:45:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:45:42):**  to be connected in that way if you have if I have chosen to explore these things and  
**[0:45:48-0:45:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:45:48):**  in some respects and it has been said to me before too by those closest to me that that's  
**[0:45:55-0:46:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:45:55):**  another it's a reinforcement of ego it's like this is you this is another selling of yourself  
**[0:46:01-0:46:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:46:01):**  and selling your own story but I feel I feel looking around that other people are going  
**[0:46:08-0:46:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:46:08):**  through this and they and they're not really they're not even they're not able to say it  
**[0:46:15-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:46:15):**  even and so I don't know maybe not even able to realize that's exactly what's happening  
**[0:46:21-0:46:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:46:21):**  and so I've tried to take throughout the last few years I definitely my intention I know  
**[0:46:26-0:46:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:46:26):**  has been strong but I've tried to take what I've learned and speak about it honestly and  
**[0:46:31-0:46:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:46:31):**  even though that often comes across I think is quite self-involved and everything else  
**[0:46:36-0:46:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:46:36):**  that I know the aim behind is to say look at this is what's going on and this is what  
**[0:46:41-0:46:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:46:41):**  can happen and these are possible resolutions or these are the next stages that we you know  
**[0:46:47-0:46:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:46:47):**  you think you have this you have this enlightenment and all of a sudden you realize you're you're  
**[0:46:51-0:46:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:46:51):**  just reinforcing the illusion again these things are necessary steps and with the disconnectedness  
**[0:46:59-0:47:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:46:59):**  the one that I know very very well from from growing up in that sterilized environment  
**[0:47:03-0:47:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:47:03):**  and constantly looking for that medicine for my own soul to reconnect that's the that that  
**[0:47:10-0:47:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:47:10):**  the duty that goes with this is safe in the knowledge as well that I know people listen  
**[0:47:15-0:47:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:47:15):**  or read these things and say Jesus isn't your man great and I think to myself in my weaker  
**[0:47:21-0:47:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:47:21):**  times Jesus isn't your man great as well and but I know I know that underneath that it's  
**[0:47:29-0:47:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:47:29):**  that's the reason that's the reason to share the story is that I've shared honestly and  
**[0:47:34-0:47:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:47:34):**  bearingly because I think that's what we need. Yeah fantastic I mean why don't there's there's  
**[0:47:45-0:47:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:47:45):**  so many things I want to ask you about why don't you tell me about a little bit about  
**[0:47:51-0:47:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:47:51):**  the work you're doing now other than building a shed and a polytunnel. The work I'm doing  
**[0:47:58-0:48:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:47:58):**  now it's quite varied I'm part of that that new generation I suppose who I'm trying to  
**[0:48:04-0:48:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:48:04):**  draw in different income streams from different places I'm teaching yoga class at the Arachna  
**[0:48:10-0:48:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:48:10):**  tomorrow I found when I was about 23 and be training to be a teacher as a primary school  
**[0:48:17-0:48:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:48:17):**  teacher that I spoke our native language Irish for about three days and previous to that  
**[0:48:25-0:48:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:48:25):**  I was like a very probably middle of the road like I was relatively I suppose I was intelligent  
**[0:48:33-0:48:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:48:33):**  in book stuff school in that type of intelligence I could hold my own and so Irish was never  
**[0:48:41-0:48:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:48:41):**  too I wasn't like foundation level but I was passed to low honors and so the language never  
**[0:48:49-0:48:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:48:49):**  held any grace I devalued the language the same as I devalued a lot of Irish culture  
**[0:48:54-0:48:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:48:54):**  because when I was young I didn't see anywhere around me kids with red hair and freckles  
**[0:48:59-0:49:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:48:59):**  who had hurdles and you know we saw summer Bay and we saw neighbors and we saw these  
**[0:49:04-0:49:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:49:04):**  good-looking blonde kids with lovely bouncy six-packs I was like Jesus where am I in that  
**[0:49:09-0:49:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:49:09):**  you know and so I spent a lot of time I think on the run for my own sense of myself I inherited  
**[0:49:16-0:49:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:49:16):**  when I was very young a nickname Gizzy and that was what I went by when I was playing  
**[0:49:20-0:49:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:49:20):**  and just the point even where the commentators on on the national television station and  
**[0:49:25-0:49:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:49:25):**  now any station would refer to me as busy and I found that there was very much stepping  
**[0:49:33-0:49:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:49:33):**  in that needed a place and one of the first steps that I took almost accidentally was  
**[0:49:39-0:49:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:49:39):**  to re-engage with the Irish language and after three days I stopped thinking in English and  
**[0:49:45-0:49:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:49:45):**  I translate into this vast store of words that we all have because we do it for 12 years  
**[0:49:50-0:49:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:49:50):**  here even though we can't speak it well I found after three days I dreamt in Irish and  
**[0:49:55-0:50:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:49:55):**  I started thinking in Irish and ever since then I've spoken Irish almost daily.  
**[0:50:06-0:50:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:50:06):**  You live in an Irish speaking part of the world as well don't you?  
**[0:50:10-0:50:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:50:10):**  Yeah Irish speaking part of the world definitely too as an escape but also towards culture  
**[0:50:15-0:50:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:50:15):**  and towards language and I'm deep in the Severus in Irish the richness that a local people  
**[0:50:25-0:50:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:50:25):**  who have spoken a language over a long time will always have because they carry the words  
**[0:50:29-0:50:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:50:29):**  that were always there whereas the Caidán which is the medium level of the school kind  
**[0:50:36-0:50:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:50:36):**  of Irish is a little bit more practice and less natural I find in myself so I think that  
**[0:50:44-0:50:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:50:44):**  was a necessary part and when I finished Ben Harling I think Diarmuid I began to step  
**[0:50:49-0:50:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:50:49):**  into my name a little bit more.  
**[0:50:51-0:50:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:50:51):**  Diarmuid meaning without envy, artificial Irishman, without envy being I would say a  
**[0:50:59-0:51:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:50:59):**  goal and step into fully owning that being without envy because it's actually one of  
**[0:51:05-0:51:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:51:05):**  the things that's grating on me at the moment and so that's stepping in and I understand  
**[0:51:13-0:51:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:51:13):**  from speaking to you before that that's an aspect of local culture in Guatemala as well  
**[0:51:18-0:51:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:51:18):**  and I think one that's really really undervalued there's definitely an invite in your name  
**[0:51:25-0:51:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:51:25):**  that is to be embodied.  
**[0:51:29-0:51:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:51:29):**  Yeah I mean here the way my friend Ronaldo Lech he's a Mayan farmer and he teaches permaculture  
**[0:51:41-0:51:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:51:41):**  he teaches permaculture as a way for Mayans to reconnect to their ancestry actually because  
**[0:51:48-0:51:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:51:48):**  he says most permaculture here is actually just Mayan farming techniques and he says  
**[0:51:54-0:52:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:51:54):**  that like every Guatemalan just like every Irish lad has a nickname but that originally  
**[0:52:00-0:52:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:52:00):**  in the culture they had a noel, a destiny that they weren't told when they were young  
**[0:52:07-0:52:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:52:07):**  but that they had to earn and step into it so that like you lost in Mayan culture you  
**[0:52:13-0:52:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:52:13):**  lost your nickname when you actually became an adult and the elders were the ones who  
**[0:52:20-0:52:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:52:20):**  judged that you know and he says that that for the most part has been lost in Mayan culture  
**[0:52:27-0:52:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:52:27):**  and the only hangover from it is the fact that everyone still has nicknames but they  
**[0:52:31-0:52:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:52:31):**  start to stay they stay with their sort of adolescent nicknames for their whole lives  
**[0:52:36-0:52:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:52:36):**  and it made me think a lot about the way Irish culture is because you know we all have nicknames  
**[0:52:42-0:52:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:52:42):**  too and I don't think many people are aware of the fact that maybe there's like this is  
**[0:52:48-0:52:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:52:48):**  only a phase in your development you know.  
**[0:52:52-0:52:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:52:52):**  That's it yeah I mean it's interesting that they have begun over there even to hold on  
**[0:52:56-0:53:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:52:56):**  to these nicknames for their entire lives it's that perpetual state of adolescence that  
**[0:53:01-0:53:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:53:01):**  a lot of us I think find ourselves in for far too long before connecting with yeah with  
**[0:53:09-0:53:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:53:09):**  why you're actually here that stage before connecting with why you're here and unfortunately  
**[0:53:13-0:53:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:53:13):**  a lot of people go through I think their a lot of their lives without ever maybe all  
**[0:53:18-0:53:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:53:18):**  of their lives without really ever connecting to that you know purpose as is the buzzword  
**[0:53:23-0:53:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:53:23):**  of the day but definitely language is language was really an essential an essential thing  
**[0:53:31-0:53:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:53:31):**  to explore and so we have started myself my partner here our baby solution was in on the  
**[0:53:37-0:53:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:53:37):**  last one too we've done a couple of retreats and basically people arrive down on a Friday  
**[0:53:43-0:53:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:53:43):**  evening to a hostel that we take out for the weekend overlooking count she bail and clobber  
**[0:53:51-0:53:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:53:51):**  beach which is this magical stretch of coastline in West Kerry just outside dingle and we run  
**[0:53:59-0:54:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:53:59):**  a it's all through Irish and these will be people who have been disconnected from the  
**[0:54:05-0:54:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:54:05):**  language there's people outside of Ireland what happens is you spend about 12 years learning  
**[0:54:10-0:54:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:54:10):**  the language learned in a way no real conversation skills are developed like you asked somebody  
**[0:54:16-0:54:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:54:16):**  how are you concerned or two and the answer is I'll make them even if they've come from  
**[0:54:21-0:54:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:54:21):**  their mother's funeral like you know it's just this is the answer there's no connection  
**[0:54:26-0:54:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:54:26):**  to what you're actually saying in yourself and so that we feel that by reconnecting people  
**[0:54:33-0:54:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:54:33):**  to their language it makes perfect sense that the English came here and took away our language  
**[0:54:39-0:54:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:54:39):**  as a method of control because it weakens the people and it makes perfect sense then  
**[0:54:45-0:54:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:54:45):**  if you turn that on its head if you take your language back you embolden and you strengthen  
**[0:54:49-0:54:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:54:49):**  the people so we have we take them down on a Friday evening and we run a yoga nidra and  
**[0:54:56-0:55:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:54:56):**  a little bit of an opening healing circle to allow for the pain that the language has  
**[0:55:01-0:55:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:55:01):**  caused them in any shape or form and then throughout the day Saturday we play hurling  
**[0:55:05-0:55:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:55:05):**  which is totally based on just exploration and curiosity with the ball with your body  
**[0:55:11-0:55:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:55:11):**  with the hurling the connection piece of ash all of that we run Siobhan is a poet and she  
**[0:55:17-0:55:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:55:17):**  does poetry workshop in Irish and then we have another woman who lives in the Burren  
**[0:55:22-0:55:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:55:22):**  Carool Nyungas and she does wild food foraging and then brings that in and makes different  
**[0:55:29-0:55:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:55:29):**  creams and potions and food as well we collect seaweed and stuff like that we do a sweat  
**[0:55:36-0:55:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:55:36):**  lodge on a Saturday night and bring everybody in in a ritual sweat lodge that we build down  
**[0:55:46-0:55:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:55:46):**  on Clara Beach and then we sit at the fire afterwards and share our experiences and share  
**[0:55:52-0:56:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:55:52):**  food and then we have a closing circle up at a standing stone the following day so it's  
**[0:56:00-0:56:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:56:00):**  really really living the language as opposed to thinking we've come down and learned this  
**[0:56:06-0:56:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:56:06):**  thing from outside it's like how do we awaken the language in you and we feel the best way  
**[0:56:11-0:56:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:56:11):**  to do that is by collecting the wild flowers the wild plants by eating the wild food by  
**[0:56:16-0:56:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:56:16):**  playing our games by getting in touch with the native poet that's in Irish that's in  
**[0:56:26-0:56:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:56:26):**  the Irish people and last year was the first one we did we felt was maybe a little bit  
**[0:56:33-0:56:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:56:33):**  chaotic because it was the first time we were doing it I guess and we were just you know  
**[0:56:37-0:56:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:56:37):**  trying to get a measure and there's the excitement that goes with the first of anything that  
**[0:56:42-0:56:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:56:42):**  was definitely very positive but then this year was really yeah we felt it was very powerful  
**[0:56:48-0:56:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:56:48):**  and very very valuable to everybody who who took part and just this week in Dublin I met  
**[0:56:55-0:56:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:56:55):**  a girl who was on it and she said look what I was I was interviewed on TV the following  
**[0:56:58-0:57:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:56:58):**  week for this part of my job and she felt it was great timing because I felt so strong  
**[0:57:04-0:57:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:57:04):**  after the retreat I felt really connected and she just wanted to thank me for that so  
**[0:57:09-0:57:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:57:09):**  that that it's that kind of feedback that it's like okay this is working this is actually  
**[0:57:14-0:57:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:57:14):**  this is this is this is strengthening people in some way so that's that's one aspect of  
**[0:57:20-0:57:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:57:20):**  it a little bit still with hurling and I do some talks and things like that and I yeah  
**[0:57:26-0:57:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:57:26):**  flying a little bit by the sea my pants on that which is getting a little bit more dangerous  
**[0:57:30-0:57:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:57:30):**  with a nine month old but things come in when they're needed and I've been very lucky with  
**[0:57:37-0:57:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:57:37):**  that a little bit of TV presenting as well and that's that's keeping that's keeping the  
**[0:57:42-0:57:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:57:42):**  you know it's keeping us ahead of you float keeping us afloat exactly and that's the big  
**[0:57:47-0:57:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:57:47):**  that's a big thing for us I think for our generation it's like how do we how do we live  
**[0:57:53-0:58:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:57:53):**  in with the permaculture mindset how do we live in connection and how do we live in respect  
**[0:58:00-0:58:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:58:00):**  of the world around us but also how do we take part and how much of it is a blockage  
**[0:58:04-0:58:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:58:04):**  how much of it is an escape or we're saying oh we're only going to use everything secondhand  
**[0:58:09-0:58:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:58:09):**  or we're not going to use I knew or whatever but actually we don't want to go into the  
**[0:58:12-0:58:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:58:12):**  marketplace and do battle which is essentially what the marketplace is because we've our  
**[0:58:18-0:58:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:58:18):**  our warrior our warrior essence you know so it's this constant dance that I find sometimes  
**[0:58:24-0:58:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:58:24):**  I sometimes I recognize it and see it that it's a little bit of an escape I don't want  
**[0:58:29-0:58:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:58:29):**  to deal with that financial world I just want to you know do our own thing and and and live  
**[0:58:34-0:58:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:58:34):**  natively but another part of me is like no there's a little bit of fear in that maybe  
**[0:58:37-0:58:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:58:37):**  you need to be able to go in you know I couldn't agree more I mean look the retreat sounds  
**[0:58:43-0:58:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:58:43):**  fantastic I god if I had a few more Bob I'd fly home and do it I'd do the next one but  
**[0:58:51-0:58:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:58:51):**  it sounds wonderful and I mean in terms of when I talked to you on the phone you said  
**[0:58:56-0:58:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:58:56):**  I don't know about the you kind of said I don't know about the interview we're not really  
**[0:58:59-0:59:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:58:59):**  doing permaculture but I mean to me that's absolutely the essence of permaculture teaching  
**[0:59:04-0:59:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:59:04):**  people or facilitating a process where people can like reconnect to themselves and the place  
**[0:59:11-0:59:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:59:11):**  that they're in it sounds fantastic and through the language as well I love it I'm ashamed  
**[0:59:17-0:59:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:59:17):**  to say my my my Irish is stuck at at past Leaving Start level unfortunately my Spanish  
**[0:59:25-0:59:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:59:25):**  is infinitely superior to my to my Irish but I'd absolutely the next time I'm home I tell  
**[0:59:32-0:59:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:59:32):**  you I'll be down trying to give you get you to give me a crash course in Irish yeah yeah  
**[0:59:37-0:59:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:59:37):**  in the meantime just drop the shame just work on that one if you know if I'd someone to  
**[0:59:42-0:59:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:59:42):**  practice with yeah to me a help but yeah it sounds fun it sounds fantastic there but and  
**[0:59:50-0:59:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:59:50):**  I know exactly what you mean about finding this balance between wanting to live this  
**[0:59:54-1:00:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=0:59:54):**  kind of life you believe in but also provide for yourself and your family and I agree you  
**[1:00:00-1:00:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:00:00):**  know for us it's very important that our farm like stand on its own two feet that it be  
**[1:00:06-1:00:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:00:06):**  like a profitable farm that pays for all of its expenses and generates enough to reinvest  
**[1:00:12-1:00:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:00:12):**  in it you know and it not because I have seen plenty of permaculture centers where it's  
**[1:00:16-1:00:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:00:16):**  kind of like oh we're doing permaculture we you know we should just get given money and  
**[1:00:21-1:00:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:00:21):**  or they fund themselves through doing courses and retreats and you know for me it was very  
**[1:00:28-1:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:00:28):**  important to get that part of it right you know to get our products in the stores and  
**[1:00:33-1:00:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:00:33):**  to we formed a cooperative here with my good friend Shad and athlete land organics and  
**[1:00:38-1:00:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:00:38):**  you know like doing the things that you don't there is that kind of warrior element to it  
**[1:00:42-1:00:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:00:42):**  so I absolutely agree with that and it is a dance you know yeah yeah so another thing  
**[1:00:49-1:00:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:00:49):**  I want to talk about before we run out of time is because it really leaped out to me  
**[1:00:54-1:01:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:00:54):**  is the is the plan is your call on GA clubs to plant the ash trees you know because it  
**[1:01:00-1:01:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:01:00):**  is quite similar in a way to what we're doing here we started a reforestation project here  
**[1:01:05-1:01:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:01:05):**  for the community where we bring volunteers in and we help people we get them planting  
**[1:01:10-1:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:01:10):**  trees and the we're from we're from very close to the center of origin of avocados here so  
**[1:01:18-1:01:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:01:18):**  you've these magnificent avocado trees and a lot of other magnificent trees that we include  
**[1:01:23-1:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:01:23):**  in the program to help people to diversify what's called here their cafes their coffee  
**[1:01:29-1:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:01:29):**  because coffee is coffee is is planted a lot up in the mountains in Guatemala it does very  
**[1:01:35-1:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:01:35):**  well but it's a shade crop it likes to grow it even though it's not native it likes to  
**[1:01:39-1:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:01:39):**  grow in the shade so we kind of came up with this system where well actually okay coffee  
**[1:01:44-1:01:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:01:44):**  itself isn't native but it does very well in the shade of a lot of native trees so we  
**[1:01:50-1:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:01:50):**  can start to take advantage of the volunteers that want to come over here and the goodwill  
**[1:01:55-1:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:01:55):**  that that's given out and and and we're just trying to plant a lot of trees you know and  
**[1:02:02-1:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:02:02):**  you know so when I heard you talking about the like making the call to GA clubs to to  
**[1:02:07-1:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:02:07):**  do the to do something similar with the ash tree to look for disease resistant strains  
**[1:02:12-1:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:02:12):**  and and and it goes so hand in hand with what I feel is very important in in in reintroducing  
**[1:02:20-1:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:02:20):**  trees onto the landscape in Ireland you know because the Ireland's lovely and green it  
**[1:02:24-1:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:02:24):**  has all this pasture but the hedgerows are gone you know and an ash is a hedgerow tree  
**[1:02:28-1:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:02:28):**  and it you know I wonder if you could just talk a little bit about that and  
**[1:02:32-1:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:02:32):**  Yeah I mean the the work you're doing there looks fantastic in that from based on the  
**[1:02:39-1:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:02:39):**  videos and also I was talking to Sarah from I think you've for your coffee beans you'll  
**[1:02:44-1:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:02:44):**  have a market up the road with coffee made by monks I think they're called up in the  
**[1:02:47-1:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:02:47):**  IT center and they've here Kieran and Sarah Shaolin they were just over in Ireland doing  
**[1:02:54-1:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:02:54):**  some doing some some workshops in the last couple of weeks and actually Shaolin is is  
**[1:03:01-1:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:03:01):**  currently in Lithuania with my partner and son yeah of all places so how two hurlers  
**[1:03:09-1:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:03:09):**  are connected by these two people who are in Lithuania at the moment even though they  
**[1:03:14-1:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:03:14):**  live you only live you live I don't know half an hour's walk from each other blows my mind  
**[1:03:21-1:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:03:21):**  but anyway I suppose we do I've been looking for a way to connect I've been looking for  
**[1:03:32-1:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:03:32):**  a way to talk to my 18 or 19 year old self I suppose and hold true to the essence of  
**[1:03:39-1:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:03:39):**  the game and not get lost in the trappings of it and get lost in the intellectualization  
**[1:03:46-1:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:03:46):**  of it or what it's like on the high street because of being an intercounty harder football  
**[1:03:51-1:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:03:51):**  or whatever it is and as you said earlier Neil and I think it's always true an awful  
**[1:03:59-1:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:03:59):**  lot of the time his nature provides medicine where it is needed and so at the moment we're  
**[1:04:07-1:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:04:07):**  the GA is an amateur organization there's 80,000 people go to the games but players  
**[1:04:12-1:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:04:12):**  don't get paid they don't know the game and that's leading to an identity issue and in  
**[1:04:20-1:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:04:20):**  some some way a crisis because obviously there is plenty of money to be made from an organization  
**[1:04:25-1:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:04:25):**  that has a part to play in every single community in the country and they also have a fantastic  
**[1:04:36-1:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:04:36):**  product they have their their main product is in my opinion the fastest most exciting  
**[1:04:43-1:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:04:43):**  most beautiful game in the world so they're never gonna be stopped for a few Bob.  
**[1:04:48-1:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:04:48):**  You're borrowing terminology from the land of branding now with it's a product to me  
**[1:04:53-1:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:04:53):**  that's that's the that's sacrilegious but it is the product you're I'm only joking you're  
**[1:04:59-1:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:04:59):**  100% right the product is is where the value is now they're beginning to believe it's a  
**[1:05:06-1:05:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:05:06):**  product as far as I can see and this is why we have the likes of Sky Sports coming in  
**[1:05:12-1:05:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:05:12):**  now and selling the game to us in a particular way and beefing up these big you know these  
**[1:05:18-1:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:05:18):**  big meetings of clashes and this revenge for this and that you know completely and overly  
**[1:05:24-1:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:05:24):**  oblivious to the roots of a lot of why there would actually be competition between two  
**[1:05:29-1:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:05:29):**  places but nevertheless we are our organization now it the way that it functions if we want  
**[1:05:37-1:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:05:37):**  to do something and we are loads of amazing programs being run by the GA but to be funded  
**[1:05:43-1:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:05:43):**  they're put out you know by the marketing team and the marketing team respond to the  
**[1:05:49-1:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:05:49):**  markets and so there's a bit of there's it's not a there's not a bit of their ease full  
**[1:05:54-1:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:05:54):**  on war in a sense for the soul of the game at the moment there are a lot of people at  
**[1:05:59-1:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:05:59):**  grassroots level who feel that the GA are selling the game out they're selling the organization  
**[1:06:04-1:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:06:04):**  out they're taking it away from old people in their houses who want to watch games because  
**[1:06:10-1:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:06:10):**  then they did because they can't afford Sky you know they're making this more illegal  
**[1:06:14-1:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:06:14):**  thing so we have this runaway train and again the medicine has to be close at hand so at  
**[1:06:23-1:06:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:06:23):**  the same time trying to make the best of what is a horrendous situation we have the ash  
**[1:06:29-1:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:06:29):**  dieback sweeping across Europe it's going to run its course in Europe it's now beginning  
**[1:06:33-1:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:06:33):**  to take hold here and there's a variety of different ways in which to look at it.  
**[1:06:40-1:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:06:40):**  Just to clarify for listeners who don't know the ash tree is is the tree that that's used  
**[1:06:45-1:06:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:06:45):**  to make hurleys which are the is the.  
**[1:06:47-1:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:06:47):**  Yeah the ashes sorry yeah the I mean the ash is the essence of it and I would say if you  
**[1:06:52-1:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:06:52):**  held it in front of 99% of people who play hurling they couldn't tell you what an ash  
**[1:06:56-1:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:06:56):**  tree from oak tree was but that so that's that's a and that and that's not as a criticism  
**[1:07:02-1:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:07:02):**  that's as a this is this is why are they this is this is a knock-on effect I suppose of  
**[1:07:12-1:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:07:12):**  the disconnection so the ash is the tree but it's also just it's a hur it's the product  
**[1:07:19-1:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:07:19):**  and it's viewed that way and so the ash dieback disease is now going to destroy the ash tree  
**[1:07:27-1:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:07:27):**  pretty much wipe it off the face of Ireland of the country and there will be a couple  
**[1:07:33-1:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:07:33):**  of resistant strains will probably form the basis of regeneration and nature undoubtedly  
**[1:07:38-1:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:07:38):**  I think will find a way to but we are we do have this this threat coming our way and I'm  
**[1:07:45-1:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:07:45):**  interested to see what way the GEA look at it because do they take up the mantle of the  
**[1:07:50-1:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:07:50):**  ash tree and say okay we have to this thing has served us so well you know we really need  
**[1:07:55-1:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:07:55):**  to we need to value it beyond the fact that we need 350,000 hurdles a year to keep the  
**[1:08:01-1:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:08:01):**  game afloat which requires 50,000 ash trees if you just look at that for Maury and mindset  
**[1:08:07-1:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:08:07):**  this is what we need to keep going and if there's going to be enough if we can get enough  
**[1:08:11-1:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:08:11):**  from Eastern Europe or wherever the dieback is not true then we don't care yes can we  
**[1:08:17-1:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:08:17):**  take up the mantle can we say okay what does the ash tree need from the experts that I  
**[1:08:26-1:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:08:26):**  can find who are most tuned into it what they're saying is that there's a fire sale in a lot  
**[1:08:31-1:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:08:31):**  of play like the likes of Norway now went through it very recently and there was a fire  
**[1:08:34-1:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:08:34):**  sale on that but the ash wasn't planted it was burned down it was you know bored whatever  
**[1:08:41-1:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:08:41):**  because it started to lose its value but what they are saying is no we need what we need  
**[1:08:48-1:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:08:48):**  to do is we need to plant more because if we plant more now we're going to identify  
**[1:08:51-1:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:08:51):**  we're going to find more is just more trees to work from which makes part to me even you  
**[1:08:58-1:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:08:58):**  may plant full 28 of ash trees and you may lose all of them this is what I was thinking  
**[1:09:05-1:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:09:05):**  yeah and this is something a project that I really is forming in me at the moment and  
**[1:09:12-1:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:09:12):**  it's and it's it'll be multifaceted if I can pull it off the way that I want to but it's  
**[1:09:21-1:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:09:21):**  the GA clubs in every community around the country that every child who starts playing  
**[1:09:26-1:09:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:09:26):**  the game they plant the ash tree in a small set of a small section that set aside of the  
**[1:09:33-1:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:09:33):**  GA grounds of which they would get a grant from the government for for a specialized  
**[1:09:38-1:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:09:38):**  native woodland but particularly ash dieback type grant that the GA club would make some  
**[1:09:44-1:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:09:44):**  money out of it too because GA clubs are just constantly trying to make money to keep services  
**[1:09:48-1:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:09:48):**  up for all people they provide for and who they provide for free and so that it's it's  
**[1:09:56-1:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:09:56):**  that that that would be cordoned off and the GA club would plant that but the children  
**[1:10:01-1:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:10:01):**  would plant that they would connect with themselves if the tree is going to keep growing that  
**[1:10:05-1:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:10:05):**  they would see the tree growing with them not not for them to take finally take their  
**[1:10:09-1:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:10:09):**  heart from at the end which they can do if they want maybe I don't know but at least  
**[1:10:14-1:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:10:14):**  reconnect the young players who are playing with the ash tree and who also take up the  
**[1:10:19-1:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:10:19):**  cause of the ash tree as well and say well I played my part in that and I think that  
**[1:10:23-1:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:10:23):**  that's part of the medicine that's that's required to reconnect the GA like I have to  
**[1:10:31-1:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:10:31):**  take I suppose I have to take responsibility for for my area where I have most sway and  
**[1:10:38-1:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:10:38):**  that's definitely in the GA because of you know work on television and stuff like that  
**[1:10:42-1:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:10:42):**  that that's where I that's where I hold the most sway and so it's like okay that's what  
**[1:10:48-1:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:10:48):**  where's my responsibility in that and how can I how can we make this happen it's in  
**[1:10:53-1:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:10:53):**  its it's in its embryonic stage at the moment I need to form a team around me and make sure  
**[1:10:58-1:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:10:58):**  it's best practice and it's the thing to do and where we're going to source it and you  
**[1:11:02-1:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:11:02):**  know there's there's a huge project but the essence of it is to get people connected.  
**[1:11:07-1:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:11:07):**  I've no doubt I mean the essence of the idea is so beautiful and I've no doubt that if  
**[1:11:13-1:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:11:13):**  you start it you'll get you'll get the support you need from all kinds of places I mean even  
**[1:11:18-1:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:11:18):**  listening like to me the agricultural benefits of getting trees back on the land you know  
**[1:11:25-1:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:11:25):**  getting the hedgerows I always talk about this getting the hedgerows back on contour  
**[1:11:29-1:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:11:29):**  to slow down water that floods across the pastures and and floods out towns further  
**[1:11:35-1:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:11:35):**  down river you know the the carbon sequestration from big trees like ash it's enormous you  
**[1:11:44-1:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:11:44):**  know there's all kinds of benefits to reconnecting people to the to the essence of the game you're  
**[1:11:48-1:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:11:48):**  absolutely right when I was playing hurling I wouldn't have picked out an ash tree from  
**[1:11:54-1:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:11:54):**  from any other tree yeah you know and I think it's an absolutely wonderful idea you know  
**[1:12:01-1:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:12:01):**  and I'd urge anybody who's who's listening to this especially anyone in Ireland who who  
**[1:12:06-1:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:12:06):**  thinks that they could be of uh of help in any way to get in touch with Dermot and unfortunately  
**[1:12:11-1:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:12:11):**  we're running out of time so why don't you um just let people know how they can reach  
**[1:12:16-1:12:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:12:16):**  you whether they want to come and do a retreat or or help you get this ash project off the  
**[1:12:22-1:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diarmud-lyng/#t=1:12:22):**  ground yeah look what we'll keep it very simple anybody who's listening definitely get in

**[0:01:24-0:01:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:01:24):**  go beyond sustainability.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:01:28):**  So today's episode is going to be a bit unusual in that I'll be stepping over to the other  
**[0:01:32-0:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:01:32):**  side of the microphone, as my good friend and permaculture blogger Mike Verhale, writer  
**[0:01:37-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:01:37):**  of the blog Permaculture Homme, asked me to do an interview with him for an article.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:01:42):**  Mike is a teacher traveler spending this year going around the world and documenting interesting  
**[0:01:47-0:01:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:01:47):**  sustainable designs along the way.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:01:49):**  He also writes a lot about how permaculture can be applied in unexpected ways, such as  
**[0:01:54-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:01:54):**  in finance, government and business.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:01:57):**  I highly recommend that you check out his blog at permaculturehomme.blogspot.com.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:02:01):**  I'll also have a link to it in the show notes of this episode on the website.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:02:09):**  Now since he wanted to know more about natural building and natural materials, we sat down  
**[0:02:13-0:02:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:02:13):**  on my front porch on a beautiful Sunday afternoon and just made a fun conversation of it.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:02:18):**  In our little session, Mike and I talk about what natural building really means and why  
**[0:02:22-0:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:02:22):**  I'm so careful to include the full spectrum of materials and even waste stream products  
**[0:02:27-0:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:02:27):**  in the definition.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:02:28):**  We get into ways of creating a more healthy and regenerative living space with natural  
**[0:02:32-0:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:02:32):**  renovations in industrial homes and I end up geeking out about everything from the intricacies  
**[0:02:37-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:02:37):**  of regenerative ecological design, some common myths and misconceptions about natural building,  
**[0:02:43-0:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:02:43):**  and even some really simple and actionable steps to making and applying your own clay-based  
**[0:02:48-0:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:02:48):**  plaster in your home.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:02:50):**  Now normally I give more of an introduction and background for my guests, but since I've  
**[0:02:54-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:02:54):**  already introduced myself and talked about my own history back in episode one of this  
**[0:02:58-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:02:58):**  show, I'll spare you all the repetition and anyone who's interested can always have a  
**[0:03:02-0:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:03:02):**  listen to the Abundant Edge intro episode.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:03:05):**  So here's me and Mike Verhale talking natural building.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:03:09):**  All right, we're talking natural building with Oliver.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:03:14):**  I have a few questions prepared and we might as well just get to them.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:03:18):**  So let's have a brief intro of yourself, what you do, and what inspired you to get into  
**[0:03:24-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:03:24):**  natural building.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:03:25):**  Yeah, well, so I have been traveling around the world even before I took the initiative  
**[0:03:33-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:03:33):**  myself.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:03:34):**  I was born in Japan.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:03:35):**  My family and I moved around about nine times before I took off on my own and since then  
**[0:03:40-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:03:40):**  I've been traveling for, at this point, about 12 years.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:03:45):**  And through all of these experiences and all of these different places that I've had the  
**[0:03:49-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:03:49):**  privilege of going to, one of the common themes and interests that I found myself diving into  
**[0:03:57-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:03:57):**  was wanting to be a provider and to create things for the needs and the wants and the  
**[0:04:07-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:04:07):**  comfort of the people that I care about while also respecting and even regenerating the  
**[0:04:14-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:04:14):**  ecology and the environment of these incredible places that I've had the pleasure of visiting.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:04:20):**  And a lot of the early jobs that I had taken were pretty common practical skills and things  
**[0:04:27-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:04:27):**  that were easy to pick up on short notice as is kind of necessary when you're traveling  
**[0:04:32-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:04:32):**  around constantly.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:04:33):**  You think of labor jobs and stuff like that.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:04:35):**  A lot of that kind of stuff.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:04:37):**  A lot of construction.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:04:38):**  I've worked in farms, vineyards, restaurant industry and then service industry.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:04:46):**  And eventually I went back to school to be a maritime engineer.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:04:49):**  I studied in Seattle, the Seattle Maritime Academy.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:04:53):**  And even back then I knew that that wasn't what I wanted to do as a career, but the engineering  
**[0:04:58-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:04:58):**  training became really useful when I started to design and build my own structures.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:05:04):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:05:06):**  And with the savings that I made for working two years in a maritime union, I put myself  
**[0:05:12-0:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:05:12):**  through the Cobb Cottage Company's apprenticeship program.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:05:17):**  And I was the first of their apprentices to do most of my apprenticeship outside of their  
**[0:05:23-0:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:05:23):**  site in Coquille, Oregon.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:05:25):**  So that's like your first introduction to people that are really focused on natural  
**[0:05:31-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:05:31):**  building?  
**[0:05:32-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:05:32):**  Yes, for sure.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:05:34):**  I did that before the first time that I came to Guatemala, which is about five years ago  
**[0:05:39-0:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:05:39):**  now.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:05:41):**  And my first workshop was in with Betty Seaman down in Southern California.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:05:46):**  And that was a one month intro to Cobb workshop where we did actually a Cobb structure surrounding  
**[0:05:52-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:05:52):**  our yurt.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:05:53):**  What a unique way to get diving into that.  
**[0:05:56-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:05:56):**  That sounds sweet.  
**[0:05:57-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:05:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:05:58):**  So we did an advanced workshop with the Cobb Cottage Company on their site and then went  
**[0:06:05-0:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:06:05):**  around and studied with a couple of other teachers, including Carol Cruz in Taos, where  
**[0:06:14-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:06:14):**  we really focused on earthen plasters and natural finishes.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:06:18):**  And that's really where like my love of doing all the finished work with natural materials  
**[0:06:22-0:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:06:22):**  really came in.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:06:24):**  Because that's one of those things that you don't have to have a natural building to apply.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:06:28):**  You can have a conventional house, you can live in an apartment or a condo and you can  
**[0:06:34-0:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:06:34):**  apply clay plasters to your walls.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:06:36):**  You can use clay based paints or natural paints and really transform the interior of a structure  
**[0:06:43-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:06:43):**  not only aesthetically, but also through the quality of air purification.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:06:48):**  And there are tons, numerous other benefits that I go over in some of the articles on  
**[0:06:53-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:06:53):**  my website about the things that you can achieve just with simple finishes with natural materials.  
**[0:06:57-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:06:57):**  That's interesting.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:06:58):**  And that sounds like something that's accessible to anybody.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:07:04):**  It really is.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:07:05):**  It really is.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:07:06):**  And that's why I include that in a lot of the workshops that I do.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:07:09):**  There's major portions on specifically finishes and plasters because beginners can do it.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:07:16):**  People who don't own their houses can do it.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:07:19):**  People who don't have the energy or the budget to create a whole new structure can add these  
**[0:07:23-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:07:23):**  components to any building.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:07:26):**  That's probably the most approachable part and one of the aspects that you can implement  
**[0:07:32-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:07:32):**  for the largest change of quality of health in an indoor space for the least amount of  
**[0:07:38-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:07:38):**  input, especially in money.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:07:40):**  That sounds super interesting.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:07:44):**  And maybe we can get into that in more detail.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:07:47):**  For sure.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:07:48):**  Yeah, later.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:07:49):**  But yeah, so that's a little bit about how I got into natural building myself.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:07:52):**  It came along with studying permaculture as well.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:07:56):**  The two things go hand in hand and there's a ton of crossover in the two worlds and the  
**[0:08:02-0:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:08:02):**  things that they aspire to do.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:08:03):**  There's many natural builders who also do permaculture design like I do.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:08:08):**  There's a lot of permaculture designers who dabble in natural building and kind of the  
**[0:08:13-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:08:13):**  combination of the two is how I based the services of my own company on.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:08:18):**  Yeah, well for me permaculture isn't any one specific thing.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:08:24):**  It's almost anything in this world, whether it's a business or a school or a way of life  
**[0:08:33-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:08:33):**  or design and it's just taking that thing and putting it through a set of principles.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:08:40):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:08:42):**  And if it matches up with enough of those principles then yeah, I think you can say  
**[0:08:48-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:08:48):**  fairly enough that it is a permaculture design.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:08:52):**  So I mean I know for myself as much as I use the gardening advice and you know the application  
**[0:08:58-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:08:58):**  of things like swales and whatnot in the designs that I do for clients, I definitely regard  
**[0:09:03-0:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:09:03):**  it more as sort of a lens or perspective through which you view other things and a criteria  
**[0:09:11-0:09:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:09:11):**  that you aspire to when you're designing or when you're implementing a new system.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:09:16):**  And it really gives you a framework to inform and like I said aspire to achieve something  
**[0:09:23-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:09:23):**  that is really in harmony that not only reaches a level of sustainability but goes beyond  
**[0:09:28-0:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:09:28):**  to regenerate the ecosystem or even the project and the lifestyle of the people that you're  
**[0:09:35-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:09:35):**  working with or working for.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:09:37):**  Okay so do you want to go over some of the principles of natural building?  
**[0:09:43-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:09:43):**  So there aren't really any set principles but these are the ones that I use to inform  
**[0:09:48-0:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:09:48):**  my designs and my projects the most.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:09:51):**  And you know there may be a lot of differences among other natural builders but these have  
**[0:09:56-0:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:09:56):**  served me really well so far.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:09:58):**  And that is that you are looking to work as much as possible with minimally processed  
**[0:10:04-0:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:10:04):**  and local materials.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:10:07):**  Now this is going to change drastically based on where you are.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:10:12):**  The local ecology, local ecosystem, even like I've assessed.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:10:19):**  Yeah the geography, the climate, the microclimate can vary tremendously even between plots where  
**[0:10:27-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:10:27):**  neighbors are.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:10:29):**  You don't find it quite as much in rural areas but especially in urban areas the factors  
**[0:10:35-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:10:35):**  that you have to work with in design and also what materials are available to you can vary  
**[0:10:41-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:10:41):**  extremely even in very close proximity.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:10:46):**  And always the first thing that I do when looking into how I'm going to approach a project  
**[0:10:53-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:10:53):**  is to assess what resources and what criteria I have to work with in the space but also  
**[0:11:01-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:11:01):**  based on the needs of my clients.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:11:04):**  So I'll give an example of where we are right now.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:11:08):**  So we're in the valley of Sununna in the mountains heading down to Lake Atitlan and I've worked  
**[0:11:16-0:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:11:16):**  for a lot of clients around here.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:11:19):**  What you tend to get is very rocky sandy soil here in the base and in the sort of the floodplain  
**[0:11:26-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:11:26):**  of the river.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:11:28):**  Whereas as soon as you start going up the slopes you can actually find though it's still  
**[0:11:32-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:11:32):**  fairly rocky you find much more clay soil.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:11:35):**  And so those people who have land down in the valley are usually struggling to find  
**[0:11:42-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:11:42):**  the clay soil on their site to use for things like wattle and daub or adobe or cob.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:11:49):**  But they have in abundance the sand and the stone that you need to make really good foundations.  
**[0:11:55-0:11:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:11:55):**  Whereas those just up the hill all of a sudden you know they've got the best clay soil that  
**[0:11:59-0:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:11:59):**  you could hope for to make these mixes but they need to source their stone or their sand  
**[0:12:04-0:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:12:04):**  from off site.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:12:07):**  Luckily we have so many different resources within walking distance.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:12:12):**  So to source just from this very small local town is like we're spoiled for choice.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:12:19):**  There's there's different types of wood.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:12:22):**  The lumber mills are not terribly far off.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:12:25):**  There's white pumice sand and lime kilns that aren't terribly far from here too.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:12:30):**  So so what do you define as not terribly far an hour or so.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:12:37):**  Yeah I'd say about an hour's drive around.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:12:40):**  Just anything that we can't get that we really need is within that distance.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:12:47):**  Obviously we do use some cement and we do use some rebar mostly because of the seismic  
**[0:12:54-0:12:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:12:54):**  factors that we have to work with here.  
**[0:12:55-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:12:55):**  We're in a very earthquake prone zone and so we really need to beef up our foundations  
**[0:13:02-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:13:02):**  and the engineering that is required to make sure that the structures remain safe.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:13:08):**  But we keep that to a minimum and we try and use as many natural materials to achieve those  
**[0:13:13-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:13:13):**  safety requirements as possible.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:13:15):**  So obviously this is just one example.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:13:19):**  I've worked in say West Africa where there's almost no wood to be had.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:13:23):**  And so the wood that we did import was probably the least sustainable of the things that we  
**[0:13:27-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:13:27):**  brought in.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:13:28):**  So we tried to keep that to a minimum as well but we were spoiled for choice for sand and  
**[0:13:33-0:13:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:13:33):**  clay soil which was everywhere in our semi arid or semi desert environment.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:13:40):**  And that was in Senegal.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:13:42):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:13:43):**  Just south of Dakar.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:13:46):**  Similar environment when I was in the Philippines we were closer down to the coast not quite  
**[0:13:51-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:13:51):**  as high in elevation as we are here and had of course a lot of clay soil.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:13:58):**  Bamboo access was not of the quality that you would really want to build as far as like  
**[0:14:03-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:14:03):**  trusses and beams.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:14:05):**  But there was a lot of local lumber.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:14:08):**  You know sometimes it can be hard to see if it's sourced sustainably but it was you know  
**[0:14:14-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:14:14):**  still a local resource.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:14:16):**  We also definitely try and use as much recycled or salvage material as possible.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:14:22):**  And this is something that my good friend Donkey he goes on and donkey but Kirk Mogart  
**[0:14:28-0:14:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:14:28):**  who runs Sundog Builders in California.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:14:31):**  And I really like how he takes the perspective of natural building in an urban environment  
**[0:14:37-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:14:37):**  can include glass and steel and concrete and all these other things because that is what  
**[0:14:42-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:14:42):**  you have in abundance in your environment.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:14:44):**  Exactly.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:14:45):**  And if you're savvy enough to figure out how to redirect it from a waste stream to you  
**[0:14:51-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:14:51):**  know take advantage of waste products recycling and repurposing materials that are all around  
**[0:14:56-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:14:56):**  you, that's the equivalent of natural building if that's what your environment is.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:15:02):**  And by diverting it away from a landfill you're doing almost as much environmental good as  
**[0:15:08-0:15:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:15:08):**  if you know it hadn't really been created in the first place because it's not taking  
**[0:15:12-0:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:15:12):**  up waste space and you know degrading in a way that's detrimental to the environment.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:15:18):**  They say like in the permaculture principles is you know number six is produce no waste.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:15:25):**  You say waste is an unused output of a system.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:15:29):**  Exactly so if you're redirecting those outputs and giving them new life in a useful way even  
**[0:15:34-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:15:34):**  if you're not using those resources the way they had been intended.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:15:38):**  Maybe if you're using you know two windows put together as a door or refabricating some  
**[0:15:46-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:15:46):**  old metal and cleaning it up and you know using it for something entirely different  
**[0:15:50-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:15:50):**  than it had originally been fabricated for.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:15:52):**  That stuff's in vogue.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:15:54):**  Exactly.  
**[0:15:55-0:16:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:15:55):**  And for good reason because especially in over consumptive societies like the states  
**[0:16:00-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:16:00):**  where I come from there's so much of it.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:16:05):**  It's incredible how much you can get for free just because you know there are some detrimental  
**[0:16:11-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:16:11):**  regulations and bad practices and habits that throw away perfectly good things.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:16:18):**  Yeah especially if you're doing something a little more smaller scale and you're around  
**[0:16:23-0:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:16:23):**  big city environments that are throwing up huge condos and the amount of waste I'm sure  
**[0:16:29-0:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:16:29):**  they have lying around.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:16:31):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:16:32):**  You got to get back.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:16:33):**  Yeah and to get back a little bit to the original question of it being like what are the principles  
**[0:16:38-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:16:38):**  of natural building.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:16:40):**  You do the best with what you have and there was a situation which I think I mentioned  
**[0:16:46-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:16:46):**  on another podcast but there was a natural build actually from around here.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:16:52):**  I wasn't at the conference but a friend of mine went and came back and told me that there  
**[0:16:56-0:17:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:16:56):**  is a guy who is just all about super Adobe and he was giving a presentation on super  
**[0:17:01-0:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:17:01):**  Adobe and talking about the land that he had bought around here and he's just like I just  
**[0:17:06-0:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:17:06):**  could not find any clay soil and I'm really struggling to do my super Adobe.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:17:10):**  This soil is just too rocky and immediately light goes off in my head because I've been  
**[0:17:16-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:17:16):**  trained with many different materials instead of just one which I had intended to just learn  
**[0:17:22-0:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:17:22):**  Cobb in the beginning but as I started to learn and study with more teachers they really  
**[0:17:26-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:17:26):**  encouraged me to study other natural building materials and as a result as soon as I hear  
**[0:17:31-0:17:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:17:31):**  a statement like that you know that the soil is too rocky to make my super Adobe.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:17:36):**  The first thing I think is we'll use the stone silly.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:17:41):**  Like if you have this abundant resource where you are don't look at it through the lens  
**[0:17:46-0:17:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:17:46):**  of I came here to do this one thing and so the land must conform to my agenda and that's  
**[0:17:53-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:17:53):**  really something that I think has set me apart a little bit though there are certainly others  
**[0:17:59-0:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:17:59):**  who work with hybrid structures and are very good at looking at the resources where they  
**[0:18:03-0:18:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:18:03):**  are but it's something that I push to all my students to all my clients that you know  
**[0:18:08-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:18:08):**  maybe you came here with an idea of what you wanted to do or an agenda of what type of  
**[0:18:12-0:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:18:12):**  structure that you had in mind but I would always encourage you to before going on with  
**[0:18:18-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:18:18):**  those ideas see what your resources are see what your limitations are and build based  
**[0:18:23-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:18:23):**  on those.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:18:24):**  Look at what the locals use.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:18:26):**  Exactly.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:18:27):**  You know you've got to be adaptable.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:18:28):**  Local communities especially less industrialized or modernized ones much like where we're living  
**[0:18:34-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:18:34):**  now are a great indication of what is the easiest strongest and most available ways  
**[0:18:42-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:18:42):**  of building because they've worked with far less resources and have long standing traditions  
**[0:18:48-0:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:18:48):**  that are adapted to their place and their time.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:18:52):**  Okay so those sound like some nice benefits of natural building.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:18:59):**  It's cheaper easier more local.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:19:03):**  So I've written a lot about this.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:19:06):**  It doesn't have to be.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:19:08):**  It can be more expensive.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:19:09):**  It can be more difficult.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:19:12):**  I mean it should always be more local but it's important to take these things into account  
**[0:19:17-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:19:17):**  and this is where a lot of people get into natural building and get confused.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:19:21):**  So I'll give the example of Cobb because most people in natural building or have heard of  
**[0:19:26-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:19:26):**  it are familiar with Cobb.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:19:30):**  Cobb obviously is the mixture of sand clay soil and straw and built up in monolithic  
**[0:19:36-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:19:36):**  forms unlike Adobe it's not made into bricks first.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:19:41):**  And people think okay those materials are very readily available.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:19:49):**  They're very easy to mix and so inherently this will be a cheaper structure and it'll  
**[0:19:55-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:19:55):**  be easier to do.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:19:57):**  But what they forget about is the amount of labor that is required to build a wall system.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:20:03):**  The reason why those high rise condos and those big development blocks of Nick mansions  
**[0:20:09-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:20:09):**  go up so fast is because they figured out a system where all the portions of assembly  
**[0:20:15-0:20:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:20:15):**  are mechanized or they're super standardized.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:20:19):**  And so it's really easy to slap up a whole bunch of stick framing a bunch of stud framing  
**[0:20:24-0:20:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:20:24):**  and just cover it with sheetrock and put a roof on it and put some paint on it is done.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:20:30):**  Obviously there's more to it than that but like if you're doing a Cobb house and you're  
**[0:20:36-0:20:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:20:36):**  not mixing it for example with machinery like a backhoe or a tractor which you definitely  
**[0:20:42-0:20:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:20:42):**  can do then you're doing it by foot.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:20:46):**  And that's an incredible amount of labor.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:20:49):**  As someone who has built a one and a half story small house it took me about five months  
**[0:20:55-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:20:55):**  mostly just to mix the walls.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:20:59):**  And obviously that is just me working by myself is probably the most inefficient way you could  
**[0:21:03-0:21:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:21:03):**  ever do that.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:21:04):**  Sounds like you don't forget it if you've done it once.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:21:07):**  No you definitely don't and you definitely get to a point in the mixture or in the process  
**[0:21:12-0:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:21:12):**  where there is just no frills.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:21:14):**  You're doing no extra movements that are required to get the result you want.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:21:21):**  And so when the labor goes up obviously the price goes up too.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:21:28):**  And in many cases especially in the West or in overdeveloped countries labor is one of  
**[0:21:34-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:21:34):**  your most expensive costs of doing any sort of project.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:21:40):**  And so if you are paying people which in one form or another you should be to mix your  
**[0:21:49-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:21:49):**  wall structure you could easily end up with a house that costs more than a conventional  
**[0:21:55-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:21:55):**  one even if your materials are nearly free even if you found them on site.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:22:00):**  This is to say nothing if you have to truck in extra sand or extra clay soil because very  
**[0:22:06-0:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:22:06):**  large quantities are needed to make a dense monolithic wall system.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:22:11):**  And so just assuming that because it's a natural building made predominantly with natural materials  
**[0:22:17-0:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:22:17):**  does not necessarily mean that it is going to be more energy efficient or cheaper or  
**[0:22:26-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:22:26):**  easier to build.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:22:28):**  So maybe the process is simple but the amount of labor makes it difficult.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:22:34):**  The rise in labor costs makes it more expensive and if you've designed it poorly it could  
**[0:22:38-0:22:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:22:38):**  be more energy consumptive than conventional industrial house.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:22:43):**  Yeah definitely these things are designs you know the conventional houses are heavily heavily  
**[0:22:52-0:22:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:22:52):**  heavily designed for super efficiency and cost effective.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:22:54):**  Well yeah these days they are the new ones are.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:22:56):**  They have to meet very stringent regulations as far as energy efficiency thermal efficiency  
**[0:23:02-0:23:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:23:02):**  and things like that and for good reason.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:23:05):**  And so as a result if you've designed or used the wrong material for your site your climate  
**[0:23:11-0:23:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:23:11):**  and all those other factors you could very easily end up spending more to heat the place  
**[0:23:17-0:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:23:17):**  or to cool it.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:23:19):**  And this is something that I go into a lot in previous articles and podcasts as well  
**[0:23:24-0:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:23:24):**  is that it's really important to know that just because it's a natural building doesn't  
**[0:23:31-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:23:31):**  inherently make it all these other things that people want to associate.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:23:34):**  There is there are design considerations there are planning considerations and you have to  
**[0:23:40-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:23:40):**  treat it like like any other construction projects you may be using better more sustainable  
**[0:23:46-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:23:46):**  materials but if you drop the ball on the design or on the project planning you could  
**[0:23:52-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:23:52):**  have just as inefficient a house is like you know some industrial thing made in the 70s.  
**[0:23:57-0:23:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:23:57):**  Yeah well just like anything.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:23:59):**  Right.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:24:00):**  It all starts with the design and putting a lot of thought into it before wasting a  
**[0:24:05-0:24:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:24:05):**  lot of energy.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:24:06):**  Of course.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:24:07):**  And like I don't say this stuff to discourage people from natural building.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:24:11):**  Quite the contrary.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:24:12):**  The fact that you you've considered your local environment and the materials that you're  
**[0:24:17-0:24:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:24:17):**  using ahead of time with a focus on doing good by the local ecology the local economy  
**[0:24:25-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:24:25):**  and all of those things you're already way ahead of the game.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:24:28):**  I mean like we're talking about though these modern housing complexes and you know condos  
**[0:24:36-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:24:36):**  and other structures have to meet these very very strict environmental regulations these  
**[0:24:41-0:24:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:24:41):**  days it doesn't take into account the industrial processes that in my opinion completely undermine  
**[0:24:48-0:24:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:24:48):**  the attempts to achieve better efficiency and better environmental impact.  
**[0:24:55-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:24:55):**  In fact as a result they're using more synthetic more industrially processed materials than  
**[0:25:00-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:25:00):**  ever before to try and achieve these high you know environmental and energy standards  
**[0:25:06-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:25:06):**  and ratings.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:25:07):**  So you know people talk about greenwashing and this is a perfect example.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:25:12):**  You know if the industrial process that creates these materials which are giving you maybe  
**[0:25:18-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:25:18):**  a higher insulative value or higher efficiency on your heating bill or your lighting bill  
**[0:25:26-0:25:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:25:26):**  are still using you know noxious chemicals or really destructive environmental processes  
**[0:25:34-0:25:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:25:34):**  to produce those materials.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:25:35):**  In my opinion it completely negates the advantages that you're going to get on the other end  
**[0:25:42-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:25:42):**  during the lifetime of those things especially if you know they can't biodegrade they can't  
**[0:25:47-0:25:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:25:47):**  be recycled.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:25:49):**  To me that's that's not a productive direction to go.  
**[0:25:53-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:25:53):**  Yeah that's that echoes a really powerful point that one of my permaculture teachers  
**[0:26:01-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:26:01):**  made is that a lot of people think sustainable living is about providing sustainable so and  
**[0:26:09-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:26:09):**  so source of your food and your building for yourself.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:26:13):**  But if your sustainable lifestyle isn't providing the people in the place around you or that  
**[0:26:22-0:26:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:26:22):**  are helping you a sustainable lifestyle as well then you are not living sustainably.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:26:29):**  Exactly and really the best that anybody can do is just try and look at as large a portion  
**[0:26:35-0:26:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:26:35):**  of the picture as possible.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:26:37):**  See how many of your actions your designs your ambitions affect other parts outside  
**[0:26:43-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:26:43):**  of yourself and your own your own little impact within that project.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:26:49):**  You know the transportation the industry that produces the materials the eventual location  
**[0:26:56-0:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:26:56):**  where your waste might end up and every person in community who interacts with those processes  
**[0:27:02-0:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:27:02):**  the more you take into account the larger picture of the impact of your actions your  
**[0:27:08-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:27:08):**  lifestyle your building projects the more likely that your efforts are going to go towards  
**[0:27:14-0:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:27:14):**  something positive something regenerative.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:27:16):**  Then if you just look at OK well how does it affect me how does it affect my direct  
**[0:27:20-0:27:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:27:20):**  neighbors because we live in a globalized society even you know as far removed as we  
**[0:27:25-0:27:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:27:25):**  are here in rural Guatemala there's nothing that doesn't touch almost every part of the  
**[0:27:33-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:27:33):**  world at this point because of the trade routes that we're connected to because of the air  
**[0:27:38-0:27:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:27:38):**  and the water that we all share.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:27:42):**  And you know that's really something that myself my colleagues my company as a whole  
**[0:27:48-0:27:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:27:48):**  really make an effort to look at the largest picture possible whenever we're implementing  
**[0:27:53-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:27:53):**  or designing for a project.  
**[0:27:55-0:27:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:27:55):**  Can be intimidating?  
**[0:27:56-0:27:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:27:56):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:27:57):**  But it you know with more experience with you know better support team as I'm constantly  
**[0:28:04-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:28:04):**  trying to add it becomes more manageable and we're starting to put in systems in place  
**[0:28:10-0:28:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:28:10):**  operating systems that make these considerations automatic.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:28:17):**  All right.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:28:18):**  Yep.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:28:19):**  That sounds great.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:28:21):**  Let's move on to you know like for people out there people reading this or listening  
**[0:28:28-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:28:28):**  like what are some of the first most basic steps one needs to take when they're trying  
**[0:28:35-0:28:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:28:35):**  to implement a natural design after they've sort of decided that that's the route they  
**[0:28:40-0:28:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:28:40):**  want to go.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:28:44):**  Well much like I just talked about figure out how many of your actions how many of your  
**[0:28:49-0:29:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:28:49):**  materials are going to impact a larger you know watershed a larger economic zone and  
**[0:29:00-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:29:00):**  see you know once you've done a little bit of that research if that doesn't change some  
**[0:29:06-0:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:29:06):**  of your priorities if that doesn't change some of what you consider to be needs.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:29:12):**  So would you say like you know sit down put together a list of what you want to do and  
**[0:29:21-0:29:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:29:21):**  what you need to do it and then sort of try to match those up with what works locally  
**[0:29:30-0:29:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:29:30):**  what you get what's available locally what's in abundance locally and maybe sort of.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:29:36):**  So it's really hard to try and think about all that on a single list.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:29:41):**  I'm you know very type A very organized and systematized.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:29:47):**  So I make lists for everything.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:29:49):**  And you know as part of the reason why even I ask for help I get help from my colleagues  
**[0:29:54-0:29:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:29:54):**  from other people in my network other people with more experience on every project that  
**[0:29:59-0:30:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:29:59):**  I do.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:30:01):**  And you know even if you're not hiring somebody else if you're just doing this on your own  
**[0:30:07-0:30:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:30:07):**  try and get as many people to help you on this project.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:30:11):**  You got like baked cookies and stuff like that.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:30:13):**  Yeah well I mean free lunches.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:30:15):**  Not I mean not only will that help you in your own goals of what you want to achieve  
**[0:30:19-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:30:19):**  but it's a essential part of creating community.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:30:23):**  Who wants to have a house in a community that doesn't want that house there and doesn't  
**[0:30:27-0:30:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:30:27):**  want them to live there.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:30:28):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:30:29):**  You know you to a certain degree no matter how much of a hermit you are which you know  
**[0:30:33-0:30:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:30:33):**  I'm speaking as someone who's fairly on the hermit scale you never want to be so isolated  
**[0:30:40-0:30:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:30:40):**  from your community or your interactions with those around you that that it breaks down  
**[0:30:49-0:30:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:30:49):**  the bonds that are really your biggest lifeline to having a regenerative lifestyle.  
**[0:30:56-0:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:30:56):**  Nobody can do that in isolation.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:30:58):**  It's the reason why we're a very very social species.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:31:02):**  If you have to source all your own water grow all your own food or kill all your own food.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:31:09):**  If you have to provide all of your own fuel whether it be you know gas or wood or solar  
**[0:31:17-0:31:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:31:17):**  you're at a huge disadvantage if you're trying to do every single one of these things by  
**[0:31:22-0:31:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:31:22):**  yourself.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:31:23):**  And that's the reason why we form ourselves into communities.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:31:25):**  We're social for survival.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:31:27):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:31:28):**  But like I'm getting away from the main question being like how do you start to plan and consider  
**[0:31:31-0:31:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:31:31):**  for a project.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:31:33):**  And so I would say the very first thing you should do is identify what you're trying to  
**[0:31:39-0:31:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:31:39):**  accomplish with your project.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:31:42):**  We'll use the example of a house.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:31:44):**  If you are trying to design and build a house for yourself there are always going to be  
**[0:31:49-0:31:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:31:49):**  some inherent needs of that house.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:31:52):**  It needs to be resistant against climactic and geographical events whether it be earthquakes  
**[0:31:57-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:31:57):**  or hurricanes or floods or anything that you are at risk for in your site and your climate.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:32:05):**  A house has to serve those functions or it doesn't work as a house.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:32:11):**  It needs to offer a certain level of comfort.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:32:13):**  It needs to offer a certain number of amenities and it's up to you to decide which of those  
**[0:32:18-0:32:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:32:18):**  are absolute necessities and how many of those are desired.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:32:22):**  How many of those are wants.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:32:25):**  So basically what I'm saying is come up with a list of absolute needs and then wants and  
**[0:32:31-0:32:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:32:31):**  be very discerning about which is which.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:32:34):**  Some people think that having an oven in their house is an absolute need.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:32:39):**  Well perhaps if your main income comes from baked goods then you could consider that a  
**[0:32:48-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:32:48):**  need.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:32:49):**  Otherwise it's a very high on the list want and it you know it'll probably make it into  
**[0:32:56-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:32:56):**  the design.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:32:57):**  But just know the difference because especially since so many people are attracted to natural  
**[0:33:03-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:33:03):**  building because they think it's so cheap they often get derailed when they're putting  
**[0:33:10-0:33:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:33:10):**  all of these modern conveniences and luxuries that we get used to in you know a developed  
**[0:33:17-0:33:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:33:17):**  western society into a natural building and all of a sudden the price skyrockets and they're  
**[0:33:23-0:33:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:33:23):**  confused as to wait how how is natural building so much cheaper.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:33:28):**  Well if you're still trying to live an over consumptive luxurious lifestyle just within  
**[0:33:33-0:33:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:33:33):**  a box that's made of natural materials you're going to quickly find that you know the difference  
**[0:33:40-0:33:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:33:40):**  in price turns into almost nothing.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:33:44):**  You know so so really get a good idea of what is essential for you to have a reasonable  
**[0:33:50-0:33:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:33:50):**  and comfortable lifestyle and the rest of which are wants.  
**[0:33:54-0:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:33:54):**  So I got to cut out the hot tub?  
**[0:33:55-0:33:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:33:55):**  You this isn't to say you have to cut anything out.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:33:59):**  I'm just saying be discerning in the beginning especially if you're working from a limited  
**[0:34:04-0:34:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:34:04):**  budget and make sure that once you start designing all of those needs are accounted for before  
**[0:34:09-0:34:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:34:09):**  you start throwing those wants in.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:34:11):**  Yeah and you are much more likely to be able to stay within your budget and come up with  
**[0:34:18-0:34:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:34:18):**  a plan for your building that is going to be manageable for the amount of money you  
**[0:34:23-0:34:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:34:23):**  have the amount of time and labor that you have to spend on it the amount of people who  
**[0:34:27-0:34:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:34:27):**  are going to be able to help you and these are all later lists that you're going to start  
**[0:34:31-0:34:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:34:31):**  making once you know your your project advances but the very first thing to do is come up  
**[0:34:36-0:34:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:34:36):**  with that needs and wants list.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:34:38):**  Okay good.  
**[0:34:39-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:34:39):**  So yeah obviously depending on how much time you want to take I can go into some of the  
**[0:34:43-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:34:43):**  other essential lists but a lot of it starts to bleed into what we learn in permaculture  
**[0:34:49-0:34:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:34:49):**  because as soon as you've identified your needs and wants you really have to assess  
**[0:34:53-0:34:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:34:53):**  your site and you're doing it from the exact same vantage point as a permaculture designer  
**[0:34:58-0:35:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:34:58):**  would be doing and for anyone who's not familiar with those criteria you're assessing you know  
**[0:35:03-0:35:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:35:03):**  obviously big picture stuff first your geography your climate the way that the sun hits your  
**[0:35:12-0:35:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:35:12):**  site and all of these other factors that you cannot change first just the inherent aspects  
**[0:35:20-0:35:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:35:20):**  of your site and then you start to go into more of the details where the microclimates  
**[0:35:25-0:35:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:35:25):**  what are some things that you can play with that you can manipulate as a designer in order  
**[0:35:30-0:35:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:35:30):**  to achieve some of the things or facilitate some of the functions and the desires of your  
**[0:35:35-0:35:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:35:35):**  design of your project and you know this is a rabbit hole that we could go so far down  
**[0:35:41-0:35:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:35:41):**  it's almost never-ending the amount of variables that you could consider on any given site  
**[0:35:46-0:35:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:35:46):**  and so this is where you know experience and just constant studying has made me good at  
**[0:35:53-0:36:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:35:53):**  these things is being able to see the interactions between these system and by these system criteria  
**[0:36:04-0:36:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:36:04):**  these factors that exist on a site that are either movable or immovable and how we can  
**[0:36:11-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:36:11):**  use the resources that are given to us on site and how much you know we have to import  
**[0:36:16-0:36:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:36:16):**  from another place in order to get desirable results that not just provide for their needs  
**[0:36:22-0:36:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:36:22):**  you know because nobody wants to live in just a you know a minimal little hut if you want  
**[0:36:31-0:36:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:36:31):**  to have an abundant and regenerative lifestyle you want to start putting in once you want  
**[0:36:36-0:36:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:36:36):**  to start building towards that abundance and the better you get at learning how to you  
**[0:36:43-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:36:43):**  know lead your landscape understand your climate in natural building especially we're looking  
**[0:36:49-0:37:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:36:49):**  at the geological the plant resources that we have and you know to however much detail  
**[0:37:00-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:37:00):**  you're willing to go into will only make your design and your planning that much more specifically  
**[0:37:07-0:37:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:37:07):**  tailored for what you are trying to achieve with your project.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:37:11):**  All right yeah good points. Observe and interact that's the first.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:37:17):**  Absolutely yeah you can definitely sum it up in you know these little nutshells of observe  
**[0:37:23-0:37:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:37:23):**  and interact and for beginners you'd be surprised at how far you can get with just very basic  
**[0:37:29-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:37:29):**  information but without it you're very quickly going to run into roadblocks into factors  
**[0:37:37-0:37:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:37:37):**  that are going to make anything you're trying to achieve that much harder so don't skimp  
**[0:37:43-0:37:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:37:43):**  on the design the planning and the understanding phases they're going to make everything including  
**[0:37:49-0:37:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:37:49):**  staying within budget more realistic down the line when you're actually implementing  
**[0:37:55-0:37:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:37:55):**  the project that would be the main thing that I would say.  
**[0:37:57-0:38:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:37:57):**  Yeah cool we hope to get some more a list in fact of resources for people that want  
**[0:38:06-0:38:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:38:06):**  to get into natural buildings so.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:38:08):**  Sure yeah I'll put a bunch of links in the show notes for the podcast and I'll share  
**[0:38:13-0:38:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:38:13):**  them with you so you can put them on this article as well.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:38:15):**  So you want to share a specific design today or you piqued my interest when you started  
**[0:38:24-0:38:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:38:24):**  talking about natural plasters and finishes things that people can do in their own homes  
**[0:38:32-0:38:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:38:32):**  right now whether they have a natural building or not.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:38:37):**  Well I'll be sure to give you a bunch of pictures of designs that I've done for landscapes and  
**[0:38:41-0:38:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:38:41):**  houses in the past but let's keep it simple for now like you were saying we can focus  
**[0:38:47-0:38:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:38:47):**  on how you can put a layer of beautiful clay based plaster on your walls.  
**[0:38:54-0:39:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:38:54):**  So let's focus on interior walls because they're much easier to experiment with.  
**[0:39:00-0:39:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:39:00):**  Obviously if you're putting something on an exterior wall it has to be pretty high performance  
**[0:39:04-0:39:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:39:04):**  or else you're going to be maintaining it or replacing it pretty often which you know  
**[0:39:07-0:39:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:39:07):**  if it's nearly free to get the materials and it's a chore that you enjoy which I like I  
**[0:39:13-0:39:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:39:13):**  love putting on plaster.  
**[0:39:15-0:39:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:39:15):**  It's not that bad of it you know it needs to be maintained frequently.  
**[0:39:20-0:39:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:39:20):**  Now are we talking about putting on a clay based plaster in almost all environments and  
**[0:39:28-0:39:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:39:28):**  like I'm from Canada it gets pretty cold.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:39:31):**  So this is why we're focusing on interiors.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:39:33):**  Oh you said interiors.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:39:35):**  So yeah I was saying if you're doing it for exteriors there's a lot more criteria you  
**[0:39:39-0:39:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:39:39):**  need to meet and you need to factor in you know your climate and all those things.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:39:44):**  Interior is a much more controlled environment and it doesn't have to be as basically as  
**[0:39:52-0:39:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:39:52):**  durable.  
**[0:39:54-0:39:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:39:54):**  You know.  
**[0:39:55-0:39:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:39:55):**  All right.  
**[0:39:56-0:39:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:39:56):**  So you still want a certain amount of durability.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:39:57):**  The main things that you don't want to happen on an interior plaster is for it to be brittle  
**[0:40:02-0:40:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:40:02):**  so like if somebody bumps up against it you don't want a chunk falling off.  
**[0:40:06-0:40:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:40:06):**  You don't want like plaster flakes flying in.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:40:09):**  Exactly and it becomes something that you have to clean.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:40:14):**  Exactly I get it.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:40:15):**  Exactly.  
**[0:40:16-0:40:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:40:16):**  And you don't want it to powder.  
**[0:40:17-0:40:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:40:17):**  So again if something touches it or rubs up on it you get like a powder of you know clay  
**[0:40:22-0:40:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:40:22):**  or some sort of pigment either rubbing off on your skin or on a utensil or something.  
**[0:40:27-0:40:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:40:27):**  Where are we starting?  
**[0:40:28-0:40:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:40:28):**  What are we doing?  
**[0:40:29-0:40:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:40:29):**  So clay varies significantly.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:40:32):**  If you're excavating clay for example where we are it's going to have a lot of different  
**[0:40:38-0:40:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:40:38):**  properties and impurities than it might just you know even further up the valley.  
**[0:40:44-0:40:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:40:44):**  So you need to analyze your clay.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:40:46):**  Now I've got a blog post on how to test for clay subsoil which I'll put a link into here.  
**[0:40:54-0:41:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:40:54):**  And basically you need to figure out by you know first identifying a bit of clay subsoil  
**[0:41:01-0:41:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:41:01):**  or obviously you can buy it in bag form usually from pottery suppliers or whatnot and that's  
**[0:41:08-0:41:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:41:08):**  how you're going to get the most uniform results.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:41:11):**  But again if you're excavating it yourself if you want to make your own from the earth  
**[0:41:15-0:41:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:41:15):**  on your land which is admirable and very cool.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:41:19):**  I've done it myself you need to test for those impurities and the properties of that clay.  
**[0:41:25-0:41:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:41:25):**  Some clay will crack significantly when it dries and others won't based on like the levels  
**[0:41:31-0:41:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:41:31):**  of silt and other minerals that are mixed in with it.  
**[0:41:34-0:41:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:41:34):**  So number one test your clay subsoil.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:41:38):**  And I won't go into all the different ways to do that.  
**[0:41:42-0:41:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:41:42):**  Basically it's just a matter of performing a number of tests.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:41:44):**  Number two.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:41:45):**  Number two figure out what sort of aggregate you're going to be putting into it.  
**[0:41:51-0:41:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:41:51):**  So if you want a very very smooth slippery nice finish coat plaster on your walls you're  
**[0:41:59-0:42:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:41:59):**  going to need to select an aggregate that's very very fine.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:42:03):**  So we're talking like marble dust or silt or very very finely sifted sand if you want  
**[0:42:09-0:42:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:42:09):**  that type of result.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:42:11):**  Now if you want more of a textured look you don't mind seeing the pores.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:42:15):**  Some of the color differentials in types of sand then you don't have to sift or filter  
**[0:42:21-0:42:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:42:21):**  it nearly as fine.  
**[0:42:23-0:42:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:42:23):**  This is where it starts coming into aesthetics.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:42:26):**  How do you want the final product to look.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:42:31):**  And all of it is just selecting these ingredients with that final result in mind.  
**[0:42:37-0:42:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:42:37):**  Then you want to think about perhaps having a secondary binder.  
**[0:42:41-0:42:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:42:41):**  Now your primary binder is going to be the clay.  
**[0:42:44-0:42:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:42:44):**  Clay is what's holding everything together.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:42:46):**  But oftentimes clay on its own will give you that powdering effect that I said we want  
**[0:42:51-0:42:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:42:51):**  to avoid in the beginning.  
**[0:42:54-0:42:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:42:54):**  There's a number of ways to prevent it from doing that.  
**[0:42:57-0:43:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:42:57):**  My personal favorite is to mix up wheat paste which is I usually just get like the cheapest  
**[0:43:05-0:43:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:43:05):**  bag of white flour that I can find and you boil water and you mix in the wheat paste  
**[0:43:12-0:43:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:43:12):**  into it into the boiled water making sure that you mix the whole time so it doesn't  
**[0:43:17-0:43:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:43:17):**  clump up.  
**[0:43:18-0:43:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:43:18):**  And then as it cools it forms this very thick paste and when it dries completely it's you  
**[0:43:23-0:43:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:43:23):**  know have you ever made you know bread like dough and stuff and you've left some on the  
**[0:43:29-0:43:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:43:29):**  inside of the pan it dries to like this horrible crust that's impossible to clean up.  
**[0:43:34-0:43:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:43:34):**  It's kind of like paper mache a little bit.  
**[0:43:36-0:43:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:43:36):**  Yeah exactly.  
**[0:43:37-0:43:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:43:37):**  Yeah now we're talking like paper mache.  
**[0:43:39-0:43:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:43:39):**  So when it dries it dries into this very tough skin.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:43:44):**  Now it can degrade if it gets wet again but again this is an interior plaster so it's  
**[0:43:49-0:43:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:43:49):**  not getting rained on.  
**[0:43:50-0:43:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:43:50):**  Okay no water balloon pipes inside?  
**[0:43:52-0:43:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:43:52):**  No well I mean that actually sounds like enough fun that I would maintain my plaster as a  
**[0:43:58-0:44:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:43:58):**  result but yeah usually if it just gets like splashed with water it's not going to degrade  
**[0:44:03-0:44:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:44:03):**  whatsoever.  
**[0:44:04-0:44:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:44:04):**  I'm talking about like if it gets wet for hours like if it were left in the rain you  
**[0:44:08-0:44:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:44:08):**  know.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:44:10):**  Okay so you need.  
**[0:44:11-0:44:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:44:11):**  So that'll help to prevent.  
**[0:44:13-0:44:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:44:13):**  You need your clay you need your aggregate and a secondary binding solution that sounds  
**[0:44:18-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:44:18):**  like that.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:44:19):**  Casing wash could work.  
**[0:44:21-0:44:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:44:21):**  Yep there's a melt casing.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:44:24):**  Yep I avoid that kind of stuff here because obviously wheat flour is a food source and  
**[0:44:32-0:44:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:44:32):**  soon as we're in a very poor community I don't want to be showing people that I'm just using  
**[0:44:36-0:44:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:44:36):**  what they would consider food or possibly even a luxury item as something to mix in  
**[0:44:41-0:44:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:44:41):**  with mud.  
**[0:44:42-0:44:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:44:42):**  Okay that's something to consider.  
**[0:44:43-0:44:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:44:43):**  But there are others so like here there's a cactus called nopal and it's common in many  
**[0:44:49-0:44:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:44:49):**  parts of the world even outside of desert regions like we're not in the desert and nopal  
**[0:44:53-0:44:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:44:53):**  grows fine here.  
**[0:44:54-0:44:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:44:54):**  Yeah I've seen some.  
**[0:44:55-0:45:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:44:55):**  If you chop it up into cubes and soak it in water for about two weeks all of the mucus  
**[0:45:00-0:45:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:45:00):**  from the inside of that cactus will mix in with that water and that cactus mucus is extremely  
**[0:45:06-0:45:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:45:06):**  good as a binder and functions very similarly to that wheat paste.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:45:09):**  If you mix that in with your plaster solution it'll often form that skin and prevent the  
**[0:45:16-0:45:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:45:16):**  powdering as a good secondary binder.  
**[0:45:20-0:45:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:45:20):**  So that's a great resource in a lot of places.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:45:23):**  There's a whole number of others.  
**[0:45:24-0:45:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:45:24):**  I go over it in other podcasts where we where we talk specifically about plasters and there's  
**[0:45:30-0:45:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:45:30):**  tons of resources online.  
**[0:45:31-0:45:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:45:31):**  So we'll link that up.  
**[0:45:33-0:45:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:45:33):**  We won't go too deep into binders.  
**[0:45:35-0:45:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:45:35):**  This is me nerding out because I absolutely love plasters.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:45:38):**  It's one of my favorite parts of natural building.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:45:41):**  So those are the three main components to a good quality plaster.  
**[0:45:47-0:45:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:45:47):**  Now you always want to do test patches.  
**[0:45:50-0:45:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:45:50):**  So get those dry materials together or you know your binder is not a dry material and  
**[0:45:55-0:46:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:45:55):**  mix them in very carefully portioned ratios and do it in small amounts.  
**[0:46:01-0:46:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:46:01):**  So maybe start with one to one ratio aggregate to clay and then add maybe say one cup of  
**[0:46:09-0:46:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:46:09):**  binder to that.  
**[0:46:11-0:46:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:46:11):**  Mix it up and put a test patch on your wall.  
**[0:46:15-0:46:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:46:15):**  And then do that with different ratios.  
**[0:46:16-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:46:16):**  Maybe you're doing a two to one ratio of clay to sand and then half a cup of binder.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:46:21):**  But obviously you need to take notes so that when you go and check after those test plasters  
**[0:46:27-0:46:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:46:27):**  dry you know exactly which ratios you put in in order to be able to repeat them on a  
**[0:46:33-0:46:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:46:33):**  larger scale.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:46:36):**  So do a bunch of test patches.  
**[0:46:37-0:46:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:46:37):**  I do this every time before I start a plaster job.  
**[0:46:40-0:46:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:46:40):**  You never know how your plaster is going to behave or perform until you've done these  
**[0:46:46-0:46:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:46:46):**  test patches.  
**[0:46:47-0:46:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:46:47):**  I teach this in the courses that I do.  
**[0:46:49-0:46:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:46:49):**  It's absolutely essential to getting a plaster that's worthwhile, that doesn't need to be  
**[0:46:54-0:46:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:46:54):**  removed or maintained too often.  
**[0:46:56-0:46:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:46:56):**  You don't want to put the whole room together.  
**[0:46:59-0:47:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:46:59):**  Exactly it's a huge amount of wasted material and time if you don't test it first.  
**[0:47:04-0:47:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:47:04):**  So once you've got your test batches and you have a mixture that meets your criteria for  
**[0:47:12-0:47:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:47:12):**  what you need it to be both aesthetically and performance wise then you can go ahead  
**[0:47:18-0:47:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:47:18):**  and do your whole wall.  
**[0:47:21-0:47:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:47:21):**  Now that's enough that's all you need to know to put in a natural plaster.  
**[0:47:25-0:47:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:47:25):**  But we can also talk about aesthetics.  
**[0:47:29-0:47:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:47:29):**  So you can put in pigments, you can put in whitening, you can add certain amounts of  
**[0:47:33-0:47:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:47:33):**  lime.  
**[0:47:35-0:47:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:47:35):**  Lime gives it, will temper any color that's inherently in your clay and make it whiter.  
**[0:47:40-0:47:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:47:40):**  So if you want a brighter room maybe putting in lime or whiting there's a lot of products  
**[0:47:45-0:47:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:47:45):**  that you can buy from pottery stores.  
**[0:47:49-0:47:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:47:49):**  Pigments you can even get from cement suppliers.  
**[0:47:51-0:47:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:47:51):**  They're often like oxides and rusts and stuff that are perfectly natural that are the commonly  
**[0:47:57-0:47:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:47:57):**  used pigments for dying cement.  
**[0:47:59-0:48:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:47:59):**  And you can buy them cheaper from cement suppliers whereas it's the exact same product from a  
**[0:48:04-0:48:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:48:04):**  clay supplier.  
**[0:48:05-0:48:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:48:05):**  That sounds like a lot of fun.  
**[0:48:06-0:48:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:48:06):**  Yeah and then you can just play with it.  
**[0:48:09-0:48:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:48:09):**  See again with your test patches how the aesthetic comes out, what the texture is, how the color  
**[0:48:16-0:48:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:48:16):**  looks after it's dried.  
**[0:48:17-0:48:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:48:17):**  Anybody who's painted a wall knows that the color after the paint has dried is often very  
**[0:48:22-0:48:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:48:22):**  different from what it looks like when it's going on.  
**[0:48:25-0:48:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:48:25):**  So just test and experiment and have fun with it.  
**[0:48:27-0:48:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:48:27):**  Like be a mad scientist of natural plasters.  
**[0:48:30-0:48:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:48:30):**  So besides aesthetics and the amount of fun it sounds to plaster up your walls on a weekend  
**[0:48:41-0:48:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:48:41):**  or something like that.  
**[0:48:42-0:48:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:48:42):**  There's a ton of other things.  
**[0:48:43-0:48:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:48:43):**  What are some of the health benefits?  
**[0:48:45-0:48:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:48:45):**  Why would someone want to do this besides just for aesthetics?  
**[0:48:50-0:48:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:48:50):**  Sure.  
**[0:48:51-0:49:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:48:51):**  So clay specifically has a lot of benefits when put on in a plaster form for the interior  
**[0:49:01-0:49:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:49:01):**  quality of the air and the quality of the humidity.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:49:05):**  Because clay is so absorbent it will help to moderate the humidity in an interior space.  
**[0:49:12-0:49:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:49:12):**  There are extreme examples of like clay plastered bathrooms where you know how you get out of  
**[0:49:17-0:49:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:49:17):**  a hot shower and you've got to wipe down the mirror because of all the fog in there.  
**[0:49:22-0:49:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:49:22):**  I've heard stories of that not being something that you have to do.  
**[0:49:25-0:49:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:49:25):**  The clay walls literally absorb up all of that vapor.  
**[0:49:30-0:49:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:49:30):**  And of course after it's been absorbed it slowly releases back into the air.  
**[0:49:35-0:49:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:49:35):**  So leave that door open and the moisture contained inside of your clay plasters in the bathroom  
**[0:49:42-0:49:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:49:42):**  will help to moderate the humidity in the rest of the space.  
**[0:49:46-0:49:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:49:46):**  So if you live in a really dry climate it'll help to keep your interior a little bit more  
**[0:49:51-0:49:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:49:51):**  moist.  
**[0:49:52-0:49:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:49:52):**  If you live in a damp climate it'll help to absorb that out in order to reduce molding  
**[0:49:58-0:50:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:49:58):**  and you know other type of rot that's inherent in really humid climates.  
**[0:50:05-0:50:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:50:05):**  For people who are worried about these types of things clay releases negatively charged  
**[0:50:13-0:50:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:50:13):**  ions into the air especially when it comes into contact with water.  
**[0:50:18-0:50:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:50:18):**  And the reason why this is important is because all of our appliances, our electronics, our  
**[0:50:22-0:50:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:50:22):**  computers, all of these things are constantly releasing positively charged ions into the  
**[0:50:26-0:50:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:50:26):**  air.  
**[0:50:27-0:50:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:50:27):**  And this can inhibit our absorption of oxygen.  
**[0:50:32-0:50:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:50:32):**  This can inhibit our respiratory response.  
**[0:50:36-0:50:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:50:36):**  I don't know all the science behind it but that's the main one.  
**[0:50:40-0:50:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:50:40):**  And the clay in the walls can help to mitigate the balance of negative and positively charged  
**[0:50:47-0:50:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:50:47):**  ions in your space.  
**[0:50:49-0:50:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:50:49):**  It helps to make you feel more alert.  
**[0:50:51-0:50:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:50:51):**  So like those bracelets that baseball players wear?  
**[0:50:55-0:50:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:50:55):**  I know what you're talking about but I can never remember what they're intended to do  
**[0:50:59-0:51:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:50:59):**  or how they work.  
**[0:51:01-0:51:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:51:01):**  Okay that sounds neat.  
**[0:51:04-0:51:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:51:04):**  I'm reminded of some visions that I've had.  
**[0:51:08-0:51:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:51:08):**  I used to live in Taiwan where there's weeks and months with almost 100% humidity and I  
**[0:51:16-0:51:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:51:16):**  could see my walls and my tile floor sweating.  
**[0:51:19-0:51:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:51:19):**  I almost cracked my head open just walking across the tile floors that were hadn't spilled  
**[0:51:26-0:51:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:51:26):**  anything on there.  
**[0:51:27-0:51:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:51:27):**  It was just the natural sweating on the floor and it gets nasty.  
**[0:51:31-0:51:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:51:31):**  Yeah obviously those are extreme examples but clay is pretty resistant to mold on its  
**[0:51:38-0:51:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:51:38):**  own better than most industrial products that you would use.  
**[0:51:43-0:51:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:51:43):**  However it will still mold at a certain point but there are additives that you can put into  
**[0:51:48-0:51:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:51:48):**  your plaster if that's something like you're a high risk area like that.  
**[0:51:52-0:51:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:51:52):**  You can mix in borax in powdered form into your clay plaster solution and it's extremely  
**[0:51:59-0:52:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:51:59):**  mold and rot resistant.  
**[0:52:01-0:52:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:52:01):**  So yeah even improving those qualities.  
**[0:52:03-0:52:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:52:03):**  There's a ton of additives and you know things that you can put into your mixture to help  
**[0:52:09-0:52:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:52:09):**  enhance whatever property it is that you're trying to maximize in those coverings.  
**[0:52:17-0:52:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:52:17):**  While we're on kind of like negative ions and what you think is healthier for them.  
**[0:52:22-0:52:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:52:22):**  I'm no scientist so I don't really know much about that.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:52:26):**  Yeah I don't claim it either.  
**[0:52:28-0:52:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:52:28):**  But I do know that there's a growing body of research that has shown a lot of negative  
**[0:52:38-0:52:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:52:38):**  health effects from these sort of like prefab high chemical building materials that we use  
**[0:52:47-0:52:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:52:47):**  to prevent fires, fireproofing in the drywall and to prevent mold and stuff like that.  
**[0:52:56-0:53:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:52:56):**  It often uses a lot of chemicals that we're finding over the course of 15, 20, 30 years  
**[0:53:02-0:53:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:53:02):**  of living in a house has some really serious negative side effects.  
**[0:53:05-0:53:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:53:05):**  So to say if you're somebody that is living in one of those kind of buildings and that  
**[0:53:11-0:53:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:53:11):**  it's worried about that sort of thing.  
**[0:53:13-0:53:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:53:13):**  Do you think like a natural clay plaster might plaster might be a remedy for that?  
**[0:53:22-0:53:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:53:22):**  One hundred percent yes.  
**[0:53:23-0:53:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:53:23):**  It will improve the air quality indoors for you no doubt.  
**[0:53:30-0:53:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:53:30):**  You know obviously on a case by case basis will depend on just how effective it is.  
**[0:53:34-0:53:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:53:34):**  The thicker the plaster that you put on the more it has space to absorb so that will increase  
**[0:53:41-0:53:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:53:41):**  the benefits.  
**[0:53:43-0:53:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:53:43):**  But yeah exactly what you're talking about has often been linked to the rise in respiratory  
**[0:53:49-0:53:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:53:49):**  and even nervous system illnesses or conditions in places with prolific use of those types  
**[0:53:58-0:53:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:53:58):**  of materials.  
**[0:53:59-0:54:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:53:59):**  Yeah a lot of people can't really help where they live you know in social economic situations  
**[0:54:04-0:54:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:54:04):**  so this sounds like.  
**[0:54:06-0:54:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:54:06):**  And what you're talking about they're called VOC's volatile organic compounds and those  
**[0:54:12-0:54:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:54:12):**  are what are released into the air and are causing so many sensitivities, negative health  
**[0:54:19-0:54:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:54:19):**  responses and they're becoming more and more common in all types of indoor environments  
**[0:54:27-0:54:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:54:27):**  from you know industrial buildings all the way down to homes.  
**[0:54:31-0:54:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:54:31):**  And it's been shown in numerous studies I don't you know have all the links right now  
**[0:54:36-0:54:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:54:36):**  but the majority of people in you know new buildings and by new I mean like 50 years  
**[0:54:43-0:54:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:54:43):**  older or less are living in worse air quality conditions than in outdoors in most cities.  
**[0:54:54-0:55:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:54:54):**  And so this is anywhere so if you're living in a fairly new home in rural areas and you're  
**[0:55:00-0:55:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:55:00):**  thinking oh well I live you know way out in the country I must be breathing better I must  
**[0:55:05-0:55:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:55:05):**  be doing so much better health wise because of the quality of the air where I live and  
**[0:55:10-0:55:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:55:10):**  you're still spending most of your day indoors say on the computer or you know whatever else  
**[0:55:15-0:55:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:55:15):**  you have to do.  
**[0:55:16-0:55:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:55:16):**  Or just say it's winter and you don't go out that often.  
**[0:55:19-0:55:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:55:19):**  You're breathing in worse quality air than outdoors in the center of the city in most  
**[0:55:24-0:55:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:55:24):**  cases.  
**[0:55:25-0:55:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:55:25):**  Wow that's scary.  
**[0:55:26-0:55:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:55:26):**  And it's really something that people don't realize because you know oftentimes you don't  
**[0:55:32-0:55:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:55:32):**  smell it.  
**[0:55:34-0:55:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:55:34):**  These types of health changes happen very gradually and it's hard to pinpoint exactly  
**[0:55:38-0:55:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:55:38):**  where they come from.  
**[0:55:40-0:55:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:55:40):**  But it's a reality of most people's living environments at this point.  
**[0:55:44-0:55:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:55:44):**  And obviously plastering your walls with clay is only one of the steps that you can take.  
**[0:55:51-0:55:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:55:51):**  But in my opinion it's one of the single best things that you can do because I don't think  
**[0:55:56-0:56:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:55:56):**  I touched on this before but clay will actually filter the air in a space.  
**[0:56:04-0:56:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:56:04):**  Now it's hard to of course gauge exactly how many toxins and impurities it can take out  
**[0:56:09-0:56:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:56:09):**  of your air.  
**[0:56:10-0:56:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:56:10):**  There are so many factors and variables that you'd have to take into account.  
**[0:56:15-0:56:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:56:15):**  But my favorite example is in these old pubs in Ireland and England.  
**[0:56:22-0:56:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:56:22):**  They used to be called brown pubs because over time with so many people smoking they  
**[0:56:29-0:56:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:56:29):**  turned these clay plastered or lime plastered walls brown.  
**[0:56:33-0:56:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:56:33):**  And you could take down the pictures of you know the pictures that had been hanging on  
**[0:56:39-0:56:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:56:39):**  the walls and there would be a marked different color behind those pictures than there were  
**[0:56:45-0:56:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:56:45):**  in front for how much absorption of this you know people just smoking that the plasters  
**[0:56:51-0:56:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:56:51):**  took in.  
**[0:56:52-0:56:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:56:52):**  So that it give you some idea of some of the benefits that that replastering your interior  
**[0:56:58-0:56:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:56:58):**  could do.  
**[0:56:59-0:57:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:56:59):**  Yeah.  
**[0:57:00-0:57:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:57:00):**  There's so many other things you can do with natural materials that I'll have a mark benefit  
**[0:57:06-0:57:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:57:06):**  on the health of your interior space.  
**[0:57:09-0:57:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:57:09):**  And that's something I'd love to talk about in more detail in another you know either  
**[0:57:14-0:57:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:57:14):**  article or podcast but we'll leave it for there for now and end up being a very long  
**[0:57:18-0:57:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:57:18):**  answer.  
**[0:57:19-0:57:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:57:19):**  So it looks like we got a good introduction and some nice inspiration for people to go  
**[0:57:24-0:57:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:57:24):**  out there and check out these designs for themselves.  
**[0:57:27-0:57:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:57:27):**  So for sure let's link it up and wrap it up.  
**[0:57:32-0:57:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:57:32):**  Sounds good.  
**[0:57:33-0:57:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:57:33):**  And yeah we'll share some of these resources and thanks for the inspiration.  
**[0:57:38-0:57:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:57:38):**  Hey thanks so much for coming by Mike.  
**[0:57:39-0:57:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:57:39):**  It was a real pleasure.  
**[0:57:41-0:57:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:57:41):**  Take care buddy.  
**[0:57:43-0:57:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:57:43):**  So before we wrap up this show for the week I've got some exciting news about the upcoming  
**[0:57:47-0:57:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:57:47):**  months and I'm joined here now with my good friend and founder of Atitlan Organics Shad  
**[0:57:51-0:57:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:57:51):**  Goodsy.  
**[0:57:52-0:57:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:57:52):**  Hey buddy what's new?  
**[0:57:53-0:57:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:57:53):**  Oh man so much is happening.  
**[0:57:56-0:57:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:57:56):**  First off though I just want to say thanks for having me man.  
**[0:57:59-0:58:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:57:59):**  I really love your podcast and I actually had a great time doing that interview back  
**[0:58:03-0:58:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:58:03):**  in one of the earlier episodes.  
**[0:58:05-0:58:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:58:05):**  Anyway probably what's most exciting is our new collaboration between Atitlan Organics  
**[0:58:10-0:58:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:58:10):**  and Abundant Edge.  
**[0:58:11-0:58:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:58:11):**  As you know we've been offering permaculture design courses for over six years now and  
**[0:58:16-0:58:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:58:16):**  they really have become a staple here in Lake Atitlan.  
**[0:58:19-0:58:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:58:19):**  In particular though the intro to permaculture course is just an amazing way for travelers,  
**[0:58:25-0:58:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:58:25):**  gardeners, architects, basically anyone to fully immerse themselves in this new paradigm  
**[0:58:31-0:58:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:58:31):**  of permaculture design.  
**[0:58:32-0:58:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:58:32):**  Like honestly you can't take this course and still see the world the same way afterward.  
**[0:58:38-0:58:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:58:38):**  Yeah that's for sure.  
**[0:58:39-0:58:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:58:39):**  It's life changing.  
**[0:58:40-0:58:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:58:40):**  But like I said what I'm most excited about is that now thanks to our collaboration we're  
**[0:58:45-0:58:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:58:45):**  going to be able to offer your natural building course immediately after every one of our  
**[0:58:50-0:58:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:58:50):**  intro to permaculture courses.  
**[0:58:53-0:58:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:58:53):**  Literally this two week offering is like possibly the most complete package that I know of available  
**[0:58:59-0:59:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:58:59):**  anywhere.  
**[0:59:00-0:59:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:59:00):**  Basically with these two courses alone I think that someone should have everything they need  
**[0:59:05-0:59:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:59:05):**  to start their own regenerative project or just their own regenerative lifestyle.  
**[0:59:10-0:59:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:59:10):**  That's what I'm excited about man.  
**[0:59:12-0:59:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:59:12):**  But yeah what about you?  
**[0:59:13-0:59:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:59:13):**  What's going on?  
**[0:59:14-0:59:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:59:14):**  Man well you know already that me and the abundant edge team are gearing up for a big  
**[0:59:18-0:59:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:59:18):**  season as well.  
**[0:59:19-0:59:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:59:19):**  I mean starting in November we'll be breaking ground on a regenerative farming demonstration  
**[0:59:24-0:59:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:59:24):**  site which is of course right down the hill from your farm.  
**[0:59:28-0:59:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:59:28):**  We'll be building animal pens, a classroom, outdoor kitchens and lounge areas connected  
**[0:59:33-0:59:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:59:33):**  to houses and it's all going to be made out of natural materials.  
**[0:59:36-0:59:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:59:36):**  I mean the site is going to serve as a demonstration farm for perennial and regenerative farming  
**[0:59:41-0:59:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:59:41):**  methods for years and years to come and we'll even be offering courses and internship opportunities  
**[0:59:47-0:59:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:59:47):**  to people who want to learn for themselves about how to build with natural materials  
**[0:59:51-0:59:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:59:51):**  and set up their own farms.  
**[0:59:53-0:59:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:59:53):**  Heck yeah!  
**[0:59:54-0:59:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:59:54):**  That sounds amazing man.  
**[0:59:56-1:00:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=0:59:56):**  And honestly this is just about the best place in the world to learn all these things too.  
**[1:00:00-1:00:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=1:00:00):**  I mean this little town is Sununah in the gorgeous tropical mountains of Guatemala like  
**[1:00:05-1:00:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=1:00:05):**  right here on the shores of Lake Atitlan.  
**[1:00:07-1:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=1:00:07):**  It's one of the most beautiful places in the world.  
**[1:00:09-1:00:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=1:00:09):**  On top of that you have this traditional indigenous Mayan culture that's still rich and alive  
**[1:00:15-1:00:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=1:00:15):**  and probably my favorite part is that we have this world international community of alternative  
**[1:00:21-1:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=1:00:21):**  people that are open to new ideas and really putting things into practice.  
**[1:00:25-1:00:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=1:00:25):**  I mean within walking distance of the bamboo guest house you've got loads of things going  
**[1:00:30-1:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=1:00:30):**  on.  
**[1:00:31-1:00:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=1:00:31):**  We've got the projects that we've already talked about but you also have yoga retreat  
**[1:00:34-1:00:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=1:00:34):**  centers.  
**[1:00:35-1:00:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=1:00:35):**  You have Charlie Rendell's natural bamboo building school.  
**[1:00:38-1:00:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=1:00:38):**  You have Love Probiotics.  
**[1:00:39-1:00:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=1:00:39):**  You've got Fungi Academy and honestly loads more alternative blow your mind type stuff.  
**[1:00:45-1:00:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=1:00:45):**  I honestly just feel like this is where it's all happening.  
**[1:00:48-1:00:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=1:00:48):**  Yeah man it really does and I want to get as many people as possible in on these projects  
**[1:00:53-1:00:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=1:00:53):**  but we've got to make sure that they've got the skills first.  
**[1:00:55-1:00:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=1:00:55):**  So what do you say?  
**[1:00:56-1:01:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=1:00:56):**  Let's offer a big discount to those who sign up for both courses.  
**[1:01:00-1:01:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=1:01:00):**  I mean all food and lodging and the amazing bamboo guest house is already included in  
**[1:01:04-1:01:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=1:01:04):**  the tuition so this will be like the best deal that we've ever offered.  
**[1:01:08-1:01:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=1:01:08):**  That's a great idea because I mean people can still take just one course if that's what  
**[1:01:12-1:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=1:01:12):**  they're into or if they can't make the full two weeks but this will actually make the  
**[1:01:16-1:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=1:01:16):**  two courses more accessible to even a wider audience of people.  
**[1:01:20-1:01:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=1:01:20):**  That way more people can get the knowledge that they need to get started doing what they  
**[1:01:24-1:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-oliver-goshey-030/#t=1:01:24):**  want to do.

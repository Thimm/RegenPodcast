**[0:02:20-0:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:02:20):**  as volunteer opportunities now at AbundantEdge.com.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:02:23):**  We're looking forward to seeing you here.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:02:26):**  My guest today is one of the most inspiring and enthusiastic educators working in permaculture  
**[0:02:31-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:02:31):**  and regenerative education anywhere in the world.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:02:34):**  Now I had the pleasure of interviewing Matt Powers, author of The Permaculture Student  
**[0:02:38-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:02:38):**  and The Permaculture Student II in the last season on this podcast and got to catch up  
**[0:02:42-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:02:42):**  with him again to talk in depth about some of the most urgent transitions facing humanity  
**[0:02:47-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:02:47):**  and how we all need to prepare ourselves to contribute positively to a regenerative shift  
**[0:02:51-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:02:51):**  in the way our societies and economies operate.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:02:55):**  In this interview, Matt breaks down how advances in technology and AI will affect us all and  
**[0:03:00-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:03:00):**  drastically disrupt our economy in the near future.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:03:03):**  But rather than paint a bleak picture of the days to come, we discuss how anyone motivated  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:03:08):**  to do so can see this shift as an incredible opportunity to retool and reskill to advance  
**[0:03:13-0:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:03:13):**  themselves and their communities in a new regenerative economy.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:03:18):**  We also talk about the types of jobs and contributions that will be most in demand in this changing  
**[0:03:23-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:03:23):**  global system and Matt even dispels the myth of the self-sufficient homestead being a way  
**[0:03:28-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:03:28):**  to insulate or disconnect ourselves during this transition.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:03:33):**  Matt is a fantastic educator and storyteller who illustrates his points with thoughtful  
**[0:03:37-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:03:37):**  observations from his own experiences and much of the beginning of this episode is spent  
**[0:03:42-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:03:42):**  talking about some of the big transitions that he and his family have gone through directly.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:03:47):**  So rather than give it all away, I'll turn things over now to Matt.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:03:52):**  Hey Matt, thanks so much for taking the time to be with us again today.  
**[0:03:55-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:03:55):**  It's been a while since we chatted.  
**[0:03:57-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:03:57):**  How are you doing?  
**[0:03:58-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:03:58):**  I'm doing amazing.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:03:59):**  You always are doing amazing.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:04:00):**  I'm so glad to hear that though.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:04:02):**  You've made a big move since we talked last and I've finally got you on Skype with a  
**[0:04:07-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:04:07):**  better microphone so we've got better audio quality.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:04:10):**  I'm super excited.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:04:11):**  Yeah, I mean last we chatted was I in the Midwest or was I on the West Coast?  
**[0:04:17-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:04:17):**  Well I think you were just moving to the West Coast but you were on the road when I caught  
**[0:04:23-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:04:23):**  you to go and do a speaking seminar at a university if I remember correctly.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:04:28):**  Oh yeah, yeah absolutely in Missouri.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:04:31):**  That's what it was.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:04:32):**  Yeah so we basically, I left Baker Creek and I moved back West to the West Coast and we  
**[0:04:38-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:04:38):**  were down in San Diego.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:04:39):**  I was working with Makeda Mokosa at the World Beat Center in San Diego in Balboa Park kind  
**[0:04:46-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:04:46):**  of expanding her food forest and helping with her children's education program there.  
**[0:04:53-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:04:53):**  She partners with the Cornell Ornithology Lab and other organizations to bring natural  
**[0:05:00-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:05:00):**  ecological permacultural education to the youth of San Diego.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:05:06):**  But then she also hosts this cultural center which is so social permaculture.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:05:09):**  It honors all the different cultural legacies through art, dance, and music of the peoples  
**[0:05:15-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:05:15):**  of San Diego.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:05:16):**  So amazing, amazing stuff and I was immersed in that in the summer and helping my mom pack  
**[0:05:22-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:05:22):**  up and put away all the different elements from her parents' home.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:05:29):**  Her mother, my nana, passed away and so we were there helping put away the home and kind  
**[0:05:37-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:05:37):**  of put things away.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:05:42):**  And then after that was finished they were going to sell the house and so we had to find  
**[0:05:46-0:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:05:46):**  a place to go and so we moved up the West Coast and we went back to climate analog that  
**[0:05:55-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:05:55):**  was going back home for me.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:05:58):**  So I grew up, and the funny thing was I didn't get to practice permaculture in the cold temperate.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:06:03):**  See that's what I was thinking.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:06:06):**  I'm wondering how it was to go back to something that was familiar to you but with this whole  
**[0:06:10-0:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:06:10):**  other perspective of having practiced permaculture and learned to understand ecosystems and ecology  
**[0:06:16-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:06:16):**  that must have really changed the way you interacted with something that still seemed  
**[0:06:21-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:06:21):**  familiar.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:06:22):**  Yeah, I basically had to go through this process of, and the way I think about it is just recalibrating  
**[0:06:28-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:06:28):**  my clocks.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:06:30):**  And so it's not necessarily a perfect analogy but when I was a bass player and there would  
**[0:06:36-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:06:36):**  be times where I wouldn't get enough practice in or times where I would stop playing because  
**[0:06:40-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:06:40):**  I just had to work full time or something like that, my fingers would lose their memory  
**[0:06:44-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:06:44):**  in a way and they would lose that perfect locked in pocket kind of clock that each finger  
**[0:06:52-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:06:52):**  needs.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:06:53):**  And so I'd have to retrain my hands and just marry the metronome really.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:06:58):**  And the equivalent of that when you change climates is you really need to recalibrate  
**[0:07:04-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:07:04):**  your settings to that new climate, to that new soil, to the season change, to the times  
**[0:07:09-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:07:09):**  when you need to harvest seed and plant, all those different things need to find their  
**[0:07:16-0:07:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:07:16):**  reset and that just involves so much observation and time.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:07:20):**  The first year I've been here, I mean, I did put in a garden, I did put in a guiding contour  
**[0:07:27-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:07:27):**  swale and then I put a keyline geometry bed off of that using equidistance so that it's  
**[0:07:33-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:07:33):**  technically not on contour.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:07:36):**  It naturally wicks off quite nicely that way too because we're in a wet climate.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:07:41):**  So yeah, the thing is when people talk about keyline, keypoints, those are actual physical  
**[0:07:50-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:07:50):**  things that are part of keyline geometry.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:07:55):**  And most people don't understand that there's like, that word keyline is a huge bundle of  
**[0:08:02-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:08:02):**  things that will shortly be coming out and I mean, there's a lot of it from coming from  
**[0:08:07-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:08:07):**  PA Yeoman and Alan Yeomans out there, but Darren Doherty is coming out with a rigorous  
**[0:08:13-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:08:13):**  handbook that is going to elucidate a lot of this.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:08:17):**  And so it's like just how we use permaculture as an adjective for a lot of things.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:08:21):**  Keyline is being used as an adjective for a lot of things.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:08:25):**  And so I just put in this system.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:08:27):**  And a lot of people think you need to have the watershed or a lot of land to do keyline.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:08:33):**  I did this on a little section of 1.5 acres.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:08:38):**  So it's got spillways on and everything.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:08:42):**  So I did all that.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:08:43):**  But most of this is just me observing the landscape and trying to understand what we  
**[0:08:47-0:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:08:47):**  can fit into this small little site that would honor the fact that we have 40 acres of national  
**[0:08:56-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:08:56):**  forest connected to us that would honor the fact that they just put in the like, I mean,  
**[0:09:03-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:09:03):**  the past 20 years is just put in really.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:09:05):**  You want to think about time wise, these houses in the middle of this mountain's ridge.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:09:13):**  And so, yeah, trying to figure out what fits takes time and observation.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:09:19):**  And so while I've done things, I've sat for a year basically observing a pond that when  
**[0:09:26-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:09:26):**  I first came was draining every year seasonally and I put ducks in it and sealed it.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:09:31):**  And now I'm looking at it.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:09:33):**  I'm watching the turbidity go down, but I want more things to happen.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:09:39):**  I want more things to develop.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:09:43):**  I'm going to be doing a micro remediation series of silt traps on the way down to it  
**[0:09:50-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:09:50):**  just to clean up the water because it's road runoff water.  
**[0:09:54-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:09:54):**  So it's been incremental in ways, but it's timing with my observation because our success  
**[0:10:02-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:10:02):**  is really determined by our level of observation.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:10:06):**  I mean, our level of understanding, which comes from our levels of observation and the  
**[0:10:10-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:10:10):**  amount of time we put in.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:10:11):**  So I'm really like practicing what I preach about observing, but taking those action steps  
**[0:10:20-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:10:20):**  when they make sense, where it's clear, and then exemplifying that with my students and  
**[0:10:26-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:10:26):**  being really transparent about it.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:10:29):**  So it's been really fun going to a climate that reminds me of my childhood and all the  
**[0:10:36-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:10:36):**  wonder and imagination that I had running through the cold temperate, being outside  
**[0:10:42-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:10:42):**  where it's really cold.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:10:46):**  I dream of ski racing again.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:10:49):**  I was a ski racer starting at age six.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:10:51):**  I started skiing when I was two years old.  
**[0:10:53-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:10:53):**  So the contours, the path of water, the path of least resistance, when they talk about  
**[0:11:00-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:11:00):**  which way is down, it's like, huh, yeah, I know exactly what that's like because that's  
**[0:11:05-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:11:05):**  fast to me.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:11:07):**  Which way is fast?  
**[0:11:09-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:11:09):**  Well, I love hearing about this process of learning that you're talking about and how  
**[0:11:13-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:11:13):**  you put that transparency in with the connection with your students, because it's something  
**[0:11:18-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:11:18):**  that we do a lot here as well.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:11:20):**  In fact, we're just wrapping up a PDC that we've taught with Atitlan Organics and bringing  
**[0:11:25-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:11:25):**  the students here onto what's basically a learning site.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:11:29):**  It's a laboratory for us here and having them walk through our process of like how we made  
**[0:11:33-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:11:33):**  the decisions that we did and how this is continuing to evolve.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:11:37):**  It's, you know, with always dealing with living systems, nothing is complete.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:11:41):**  It's always in fluctuation.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:11:43):**  But so along these lines, I want to talk and shift a little bit to something that you had  
**[0:11:47-0:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:11:47):**  covered recently within the sustainable design masterclass with our good friends, Rolly Latham  
**[0:11:53-0:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:11:53):**  and Neil Spackman.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:11:56):**  And you covered this concept of breaking into a regenerative economy and how you can use  
**[0:12:02-0:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:12:02):**  these same ideas and principles of permaculture design and work it into other career paths.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:12:10):**  And I'm hoping that you could start to talk to us a little bit about some of the things  
**[0:12:13-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:12:13):**  that you found in what's available as far as meaningful work, well compensated work  
**[0:12:20-0:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:12:20):**  that contributes in a meaningful way to new solutions and alternative options within what  
**[0:12:29-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:12:29):**  most of us consider to be a pretty destructive economic system that most of us currently  
**[0:12:33-0:12:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:12:33):**  live in.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:12:34):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:12:35):**  So, yeah.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:12:37):**  There's so much to this conversation.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:12:41):**  This is one of the things that I think about constantly because from my perspective, I'm  
**[0:12:45-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:12:45):**  a high school English teacher at my core.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:12:48):**  And so that's what my mom's mom, my last grandparent did and aspired to be a writer.  
**[0:12:56-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:12:56):**  And so this is like a legacy thing.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:12:58):**  My mom was an educator.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:13:01):**  She actually wrote the first curriculum for special ed in the state of New York for middle  
**[0:13:07-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:13:07):**  school.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:13:08):**  And so this idea of creating precedent, you know, I'm all about.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:13:11):**  And so we need to do this all individually, though, with our own lives, communities, bioregions,  
**[0:13:17-0:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:13:17):**  local economies and global economies, because I mean, in our community, we really like to  
**[0:13:26-0:13:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:13:26):**  focus on the natural, focus on nature and all this stuff and kind of stay out of other  
**[0:13:32-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:13:32):**  pools, per se, sometimes.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:13:34):**  And so certain things are happening in the world that maybe people in the regenerative  
**[0:13:39-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:13:39):**  and permaculture landscape are not aware of.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:13:42):**  AI is going to take 10 to 50 percent of U.S. jobs.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:13:47):**  And those are the jobs that we necessarily don't want.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:13:54):**  And they're part of a degenerative economy.  
**[0:13:56-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:13:56):**  Right.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:13:57):**  It's not even necessarily a bad thing, but it is going to cause a big shift in how work  
**[0:14:02-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:14:02):**  is thought of and how much time we individually spend on it.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:14:07):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:14:08):**  And there's going to be a disruption and it's not going to be Terminator.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:14:11):**  It's not generally AI is is is so far in the future.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:14:15):**  They don't know if it's even possible.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:14:17):**  So all the wonderful science fiction nightmares that have been concocted and fed, we can set  
**[0:14:23-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:14:23):**  aside and instead feast on this completely realistic disruption that is coming, where  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:14:33):**  you're going to have a lot of people who are searching for meaning, searching for purpose,  
**[0:14:38-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:14:38):**  searching for connection.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:14:42):**  And not only that, at the same time period as all this is ramping up, our environment  
**[0:14:47-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:14:47):**  is going to be ramping down.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:14:51):**  The same exact overlap of AI taking off in the bold new world, the overlap is exact with  
**[0:14:58-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:14:58):**  our environment collapsing.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:15:01):**  And so while people are like, I mean, we really need to step into this, acknowledging all  
**[0:15:09-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:15:09):**  these different elements and aspects and then carving the path that is the regenerative  
**[0:15:15-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:15:15):**  path through this.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:15:17):**  And we got to do with eyes open and we got to do transparently and we've got to do it  
**[0:15:21-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:15:21):**  in a way that gathers all these threads and stories together regeneratively, honoring  
**[0:15:27-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:15:27):**  what is actually being served by that story to those people.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:15:33):**  So what is AI actually feeding to people?  
**[0:15:36-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:15:36):**  They're like, well, you're going to not have those boring jobs anymore.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:15:38):**  Well, the cancer misdiagnosis, that won't happen anymore.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:15:42):**  That like all these things that are like, oh, yeah, it'll fix it.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:15:46):**  Oh, yeah, benefit, benefit.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:15:49):**  Those kinds of things are, yes, we want them.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:15:52):**  But the reality is what's going to happen is so disruptive that we, people are painting  
**[0:15:59-0:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:15:59):**  like this huge depression, anxiety, like economic, huge fluctuation, loss of the middle class,  
**[0:16:06-0:16:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:16:06):**  huge bifurcation of classes.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:16:08):**  And the reality is, though, in the regenerative economy, which ties all these threads together,  
**[0:16:15-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:16:15):**  provide solutions for problems and allows for edges to beneficially connect, is the  
**[0:16:22-0:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:16:22):**  path that's going to allow for us to have jobs for everyone, going to have roles for  
**[0:16:28-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:16:28):**  everyone, going to have an economy that doesn't look just through a physical lens, that looks  
**[0:16:33-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:16:33):**  through all the different forms of capital that is constantly growing more, just like  
**[0:16:40-0:16:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:16:40):**  nature does.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:16:41):**  Right.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:16:42):**  So what happens when you enrich the soil is you open up more niches, you open up more  
**[0:16:48-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:16:48):**  biodiversity opportunities, and then it cycles more and then it gets a greater diversity  
**[0:16:52-0:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:16:52):**  of nutrients and minerals by available.  
**[0:16:55-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:16:55):**  And then you get a greater response from the life expressions and the larger life forms.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:16:59):**  And I mean, that's just how it works.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:17:02):**  So if we can inoculate all these disruptions that are here and are coming with permaculture  
**[0:17:13-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:17:13):**  solutions, even as we hit peak oil, even as we hit, I mean, we've hit recently, and most  
**[0:17:18-0:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:17:18):**  people don't realize this, it's still nuisance for some people, we've hit recycled plastic.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:17:26):**  There's no more recycling plastic in America.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:17:30):**  We're at a point where China and other Asian countries that once took our plastic and recycled  
**[0:17:36-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:17:36):**  it for us, and they bought it, bid it on a market, in the recycling market, no longer  
**[0:17:43-0:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:17:43):**  are accepting it, no longer interested in continuing this relationship.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:17:47):**  Some people are saying it has to do with Trump.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:17:48):**  I don't know for sure.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:17:50):**  But what I do know is it looks like it's never going to come back.  
**[0:17:55-0:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:17:55):**  And the oceans themselves have kind of shown us that we are at limits, land, ocean, we're  
**[0:18:04-0:18:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:18:04):**  at the limit.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:18:05):**  Now is the time where we really need to rethink things.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:18:09):**  So what we see is...  
**[0:18:12-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:18:12):**  So here, so paint a picture for me here.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:18:15):**  I'm on board with this transition.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:18:17):**  Can you sort of illustrate the concept of what a regenerative economy might look like  
**[0:18:22-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:18:22):**  and how we can prepare ourselves to participate in it in a productive way?  
**[0:18:27-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:18:27):**  Right.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:18:28):**  So the first thing we need to probably do is get rid of the homesteading myth that we  
**[0:18:32-0:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:18:32):**  can just get a piece of land and then we can just isolate ourselves from the world and  
**[0:18:36-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:18:36):**  then we can just homestead.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:18:38):**  We need to create real value in our world and we need to think big.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:18:43):**  We need to think how we can serve the world at our highest level and then things will  
**[0:18:47-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:18:47):**  start moving and that takes observation, reflection, and creativity.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:18:53):**  We need to start thinking about things creatively like the Pacific Garbage Patch, right?  
**[0:18:57-0:19:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:18:57):**  Well, the reality is that we have people working on this who are actively going to start the  
**[0:19:03-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:19:03):**  solution and what they're going to do is they're going to be gathering all that plastic up  
**[0:19:08-0:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:19:08):**  and processing it and then making it into those beads and then as post-consumer plastic  
**[0:19:13-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:19:13):**  they're going to be reforming it into new products.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:19:16):**  So suddenly there's this business opportunity to empower people by having the products they're  
**[0:19:21-0:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:19:21):**  using right now take on significant meaning in their lives and it's like, wait, but these  
**[0:19:29-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:19:29):**  pair of scissors, they don't mean anything to me other than they're serviceable scissors  
**[0:19:35-0:19:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:19:35):**  but if they were part suddenly part of the recycle like the local recycle community and  
**[0:19:40-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:19:40):**  the original plastic came from the ocean then I know that this is never going to leave our  
**[0:19:46-0:19:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:19:46):**  communities because we can create community level plastic recycling.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:19:51):**  That's totally possible but this came from the ocean so it's part of my values, it's  
**[0:19:56-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:19:56):**  part of my beliefs and when my children use it they know that they have taken part of  
**[0:20:02-0:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:20:02):**  the plastic out of the ocean and so while we have this like plastic-based culture we're  
**[0:20:10-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:20:10):**  inoculating that problem with value-based solutions and that's, you know what I mean,  
**[0:20:17-0:20:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:20:17):**  that's one side of it and that may be like a super technical thing but on the other side  
**[0:20:21-0:20:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:20:21):**  of it it's like how are we going to get all those, all the schools, how are we going to  
**[0:20:29-0:20:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:20:29):**  get all the food they need, all the clean water, all these different things that they  
**[0:20:37-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:20:37):**  need if it's not through these channels in the future.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:20:41):**  If we aren't growing food biologically, if we aren't, I mean we are reaching the peak  
**[0:20:47-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:20:47):**  limits of all these things so it's, the regenerative pathways are marketable and competitive because  
**[0:21:02-0:21:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:21:02):**  they do things at a higher level biologically for the soil, for the atmosphere, for our  
**[0:21:09-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:21:09):**  bodies so it's this like win-win-win-win on all these different levels and so we're starting,  
**[0:21:17-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:21:17):**  I mean I started with meaning right and at tying to that big solution but you can also  
**[0:21:22-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:21:22):**  make this the Curtis Stone solution with your backyards, turning all your neighborhood's  
**[0:21:28-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:21:28):**  backyards into gardens where two people manage them all and then everyone gets a portion  
**[0:21:34-0:21:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:21:34):**  enough for their family and then the excess goes to CSA that supports the couple that  
**[0:21:38-0:21:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:21:38):**  goes and manages all the landscapes.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:21:42):**  These kind of simple solutions, they're how we're going to draw our communities together,  
**[0:21:49-0:21:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:21:49):**  they're how we're going to get through these hard times that are inevitable.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:21:53):**  And so that makes a lot of sense to me and there's an easy connection there.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:21:58):**  It's very easy to make that transition between you know growing your own food within a suburban  
**[0:22:04-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:22:04):**  or an urban setting and doing good for your local community and your ecology.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:22:09):**  Can you help us to make the connection for say someone out there who has a career path  
**[0:22:13-0:22:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:22:13):**  or a skill set that they're struggling to see the easy segue into using that skill set  
**[0:22:20-0:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:22:20):**  towards something considered to be regenerative and maybe explain how either you can retool  
**[0:22:26-0:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:22:26):**  or use the skills you already have to contribute in perhaps a less direct way such as you know  
**[0:22:32-0:22:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:22:32):**  planting a veggie garden but still contribute meaningfully to this transition that we need  
**[0:22:37-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:22:37):**  to make.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:22:38):**  The reality is every job has a regenerative twin in the regenerative economy.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:22:47):**  Because as we diagnose that role and you're like oh well we need garbage taken care of,  
**[0:22:53-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:22:53):**  we need to handle our waste at the core level, and we need experts that can handle all of  
**[0:23:01-0:23:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:23:01):**  our waste because it's at that large level.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:23:04):**  So what is wrong, what's degenerative about the tasks they perform?  
**[0:23:11-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:23:11):**  And when you break it down into behaviors, well those are substitutable.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:23:18):**  And then when you break it all the way down to principles, needs, the actual like dealing  
**[0:23:24-0:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:23:24):**  with our waste positively, right?  
**[0:23:26-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:23:26):**  They're dealing with our waste so that we don't have to have a problem happen but they  
**[0:23:30-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:23:30):**  can deal with our waste in a positive regenerative way.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:23:34):**  And how that breaks down is really where the creativity comes in.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:23:41):**  So let's say for instance you've got a like just a neighborhood level and I'll just keep  
**[0:23:49-0:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:23:49):**  going micro to macro because that's how I keep thinking about all this and trying to  
**[0:23:55-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:23:55):**  show that we really need both.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:23:57):**  And I know most of the people listening here and most of the people listening on my shows  
**[0:24:02-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:24:02):**  and in my classes are not thinking like giant scale but we really need to so that we can  
**[0:24:13-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:24:13):**  cast those visions large enough that everyone can go, oh I can see how I can contribute  
**[0:24:19-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:24:19):**  to that with my part of that, you know what I mean?  
**[0:24:23-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:24:23):**  So I really want to cast it in both ways.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:24:27):**  So you're gathering up all the compost from your neighborhood, you're really good at  
**[0:24:32-0:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:24:32):**  composting, maybe you're doing the hot composting thermophilic, maybe using EM and then you're  
**[0:24:38-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:24:38):**  fermenting things and doing lower heat compost but you're handling all the waste for the  
**[0:24:44-0:24:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:24:44):**  neighborhood and then it's feeding back into the gardens and that allows you to get a certain  
**[0:24:48-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:24:48):**  portion of the proceeds from those gardens or allows you to have a garden plot here or  
**[0:24:54-0:24:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:24:54):**  maybe they just pay you and then you get paid a straight up fee and then they get compost  
**[0:24:59-0:25:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:24:59):**  and it's all always transparently done, people can come check it out.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:25:04):**  But you're providing a real service that sequesters all that carbon from their, well not all of  
**[0:25:11-0:25:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:25:11):**  it but you can't ever get all of it, but sequesters most of the carbon from that garbage that  
**[0:25:17-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:25:17):**  would be lost as methane and other forms that's leaching into the water or stuff like that  
**[0:25:26-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:25:26):**  but you're stopping that and providing that service and you're keeping it within the community.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:25:30):**  Now let's break out to like a New York level.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:25:34):**  So you've got all this waste.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:25:37):**  Now if we could actually process this stuff and keep things separated, suddenly we could  
**[0:25:43-0:25:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:25:43):**  be having the organic matter that can be turned into soil, be turned back into soil, thermophilic  
**[0:25:49-0:25:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:25:49):**  so you've got that and it's not sterilization, it's thermophilic decomposition which is aerobic  
**[0:25:59-0:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:25:59):**  and gets you to this sweet spot where there's no anaerobes, you know pathogens, it's really  
**[0:26:08-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:26:08):**  great and that's 130 degrees for three days is actually the composting US standard so  
**[0:26:13-0:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:26:13):**  that's the idea behind that.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:26:15):**  So you're breaking those down, you're making great soil for that and then you're redistributing  
**[0:26:18-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:26:18):**  that to the parks or in selling it to gardens or whatnot and then you have the stuff that  
**[0:26:25-0:26:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:26:25):**  is the human waste and the sewage and all that kind of stuff and let's make sure that  
**[0:26:31-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:26:31):**  we don't put our medicine down the drain, let's make sure that you know things that  
**[0:26:34-0:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:26:34):**  don't belong down the drain that don't break down and maybe we even introduce the toilets  
**[0:26:39-0:26:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:26:39):**  that separate the urine from the humanure even better and then the urine can be used  
**[0:26:45-0:26:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:26:45):**  as a fertilizer or an anti-fungal on plants that are getting the powdery mildew or what  
**[0:26:50-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:26:50):**  have you but then you get the methane and then you can burn the methane in a closed  
**[0:26:58-0:27:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:26:58):**  circuit and have that carbon that's released in the carbon dioxide go right into a closed  
**[0:27:05-0:27:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:27:05):**  loop growing of like algae or something like spirulina or something like that, that's a  
**[0:27:11-0:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:27:11):**  plant that's going to eat that and then release oxygen and then embody that carbon again and  
**[0:27:16-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:27:16):**  then you can take that algae, you can feed it to things, you can run different processes,  
**[0:27:22-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:27:22):**  you can make fuel out of it and or you can just feed it right back into the system and  
**[0:27:27-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:27:27):**  decompose it and make more.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:27:29):**  So there's enormous potential and like I said, I mean AI is coming so fast, I mean it's just  
**[0:27:39-0:27:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:27:39):**  all that is is task-based algorithms, it's not general AI, all these things can happen  
**[0:27:45-0:27:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:27:45):**  now though, we can handle huge amounts of new data, new systems management that were  
**[0:27:52-0:27:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:27:52):**  just mind-boggling, I mean there's a reason why in New York, you go below New York City  
**[0:27:56-0:27:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:27:56):**  and they don't know where the water comes and goes from, they know it enters the city  
**[0:27:59-0:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:27:59):**  here and they know it goes out here and here but they have no idea because it's all been  
**[0:28:04-0:28:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:28:04):**  an add-on to an add-on to an add-on and you look at the New York City streets, people  
**[0:28:09-0:28:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:28:09):**  don't realize it's in most places 10 stories deeper before they'll even hit native soil.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:28:15):**  So the needs are massive, the tools that we have are kind of mind-boggling, we have such  
**[0:28:23-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:28:23):**  powerful tools, we have all the things that we need right now to make massive change on  
**[0:28:27-0:28:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:28:27):**  the earth, to rewild the earth, to restore the earth and the list plateau is a great  
**[0:28:32-0:28:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:28:32):**  example that $14 per hectare to convert 500,000, half a million square kilometers of China  
**[0:28:44-0:28:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:28:44):**  from degraded land into perennial and tree-based vegetation.  
**[0:28:55-0:29:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:28:55):**  So I really think that as the information gets out, and we're really close to almost  
**[0:29:03-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:29:03):**  all the information getting out there, I mean the carbon credit schemes that have held so  
**[0:29:10-0:29:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:29:10):**  much promise in the quantification world really fall apart when you look ecologically at what's  
**[0:29:15-0:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:29:15):**  going on with the desertification of our world, with climate change, climate weirding or what  
**[0:29:21-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:29:21):**  have you, so what I see is the end of the degenerative economy because it's on a dead-end  
**[0:29:32-0:29:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:29:32):**  road and all the jobs that we have been doing this entire time that have provided meaning  
**[0:29:40-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:29:40):**  and provided respect in our society, they're not serving those purposes anymore.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:29:51):**  People, I think it's 80% of people don't find meaning in their job, they don't feel connected  
**[0:29:59-0:30:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:29:59):**  and that, when you add in the amount of pressure that's about to hit with the economic downturn  
**[0:30:08-0:30:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:30:08):**  that's going to happen, it's a more job market downturn than it is economic because those  
**[0:30:14-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:30:14):**  businesses are going to be able to say on paper that they're making so much more because  
**[0:30:17-0:30:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:30:17):**  they're going to fire so many people.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:30:21):**  It's really important that we start inoculating our communities with resilience so that we  
**[0:30:30-0:30:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:30:30):**  are insulated against changes to our economies because, I mean, when you think about it,  
**[0:30:35-0:30:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:30:35):**  our food, fuel, fiber and medicine should all be bioregional just for safety purposes  
**[0:30:43-0:30:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:30:43):**  in case there's a hiccup in service and then on top of it you're going to get the best  
**[0:30:50-0:30:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:30:50):**  food bioregional.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:30:52):**  Yeah I think that's one of the inspiring things is that doesn't have to be a limiting factor  
**[0:30:56-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:30:56):**  and one thing that really, yeah, quite on the contrary, it can mean a higher quality,  
**[0:31:01-0:31:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:31:01):**  it can mean much better quality, flavor and innovation within recipes and reconnecting  
**[0:31:08-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:31:08):**  with the heritage of the food from your area as well.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:31:11):**  Yeah and I think that's a big part of this that I probably didn't emphasize enough.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:31:17):**  This is, I mean permaculture really is, people see it as, a lot of people just see it as  
**[0:31:22-0:31:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:31:22):**  home setting and that's why I brought up the home setting myth early on.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:31:25):**  They see it as this way that they get to stop working.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:31:28):**  They're like, oh this is the way I get to escape and it's like, no, this is the way  
**[0:31:32-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:31:32):**  you get to plug in to the community finally and to the natural world finally.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:31:40):**  That's definitely what I've found since we started doing our own demonstration site here  
**[0:31:44-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:31:44):**  in Guatemala as well.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:31:45):**  Yeah and it's really a heart based learning and then it becomes a heart based language  
**[0:31:51-0:32:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:31:51):**  that you speak rather than this quantification based thing that the carbon credit thing is.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:32:01):**  So this is why it's very difficult with our current economy to see this path, to be like,  
**[0:32:08-0:32:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:32:08):**  wait but we're speaking from the heart here, this is healing communities.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:32:12):**  And so it feels so foreign when we look at like an Elon Musk or when we look at Ford  
**[0:32:18-0:32:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:32:18):**  or when we look at these examples of what economy means.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:32:33):**  People compare them to predators but they don't behave as predators behave.  
**[0:32:37-0:32:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:32:37):**  They dominate, they inoculate.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:32:40):**  It's more like a vocal pathogenic fungi which is always indicative of imbalance.  
**[0:32:52-0:33:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:32:52):**  What we really need, what real stability is is diversity, localization and individual  
**[0:33:01-0:33:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:33:01):**  expression.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:33:03):**  It's like that bridge with all the teeny little triangles that we made in seventh grade in  
**[0:33:07-0:33:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:33:07):**  like woodshop.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:33:08):**  You know what I mean?  
**[0:33:09-0:33:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:33:09):**  It's like, yeah, that's the winner of the weight test because you had the diversity,  
**[0:33:16-0:33:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:33:16):**  the pattern of diversity built in.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:33:19):**  And that's really what we're bringing back and because it has all these things that we  
**[0:33:28-0:33:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:33:28):**  didn't give an economic value to built into them, it feels like we're doing extra work  
**[0:33:34-0:33:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:33:34):**  or work that is for free or it hits all these weird buttons in us.  
**[0:33:43-0:33:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:33:43):**  But the reality is it's like that's the actual work.  
**[0:33:46-0:33:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:33:46):**  You taking the time, the unquantifiable work, spending time with our grandparents, having  
**[0:33:53-0:34:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:33:53):**  our children have that amazing blessing of spending time with their great grandparents.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:34:00):**  Those kinds of things you can't put a price tag on.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:34:02):**  You can't quantify, but you know, they're so valuable to culture.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:34:07):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:34:08):**  Well, so here on these lines, let's go back to something you said earlier and how at your  
**[0:34:13-0:34:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:34:13):**  core you are an educator.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:34:15):**  You have been working in the teaching fields for a while and it's been a big focus on the  
**[0:34:19-0:34:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:34:19):**  content that you've put out and the books that you've written.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:34:22):**  So let's get down to the most effective dose, so to speak, of the retooling, the reskilling  
**[0:34:31-0:34:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:34:31):**  and the information that's going to be relevant to people in this shift of economic status  
**[0:34:38-0:34:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:34:38):**  and how we can prepare ourselves as far as training and knowledge to operate in a healthy  
**[0:34:46-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:34:46):**  way within this shift of systems.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:34:49):**  Well, this really reflects kind of where I am and where I'm heading when I say this.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:34:59):**  But we need to work on ourselves most of all.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:35:07):**  Our ability to be flexible mentally and our ability to give and receive compassion.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:35:17):**  And those kinds of things will allow us to learn and be flexible and do all the things  
**[0:35:22-0:35:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:35:22):**  that need to be done.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:35:26):**  But I think those are the skills that may seem unrelated to what we're facing, but they're  
**[0:35:34-0:35:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:35:34):**  actually the skills that we really don't teach in school.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:35:36):**  They're the skills that we don't value in our economy and even in our interactions in  
**[0:35:45-0:35:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:35:45):**  business and jobs, our ideas of success a lot of the time.  
**[0:35:51-0:36:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:35:51):**  So I mean, having an understanding of who we are and having the kind of self-control,  
**[0:36:01-0:36:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:36:01):**  emotional self-control to serve at a time of great stress and need.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:36:09):**  Because the reality is this, we could make all, like we could make it like a series of  
**[0:36:14-0:36:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:36:14):**  keywords and like you could set up all the information so that you just follow these  
**[0:36:19-0:36:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:36:19):**  keywords and then it's just information, right?  
**[0:36:21-0:36:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:36:21):**  So almost anyone can access and find the answers to any regenerative or permaculture question.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:36:27):**  It's just information.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:36:29):**  Like they could create an AI app to be a really helpful guy and like really enthusiastic to  
**[0:36:35-0:36:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:36:35):**  replace me.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:36:37):**  And so it's really more than just information that we have to have to really grasp.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:36:45):**  It's an emotional, it's even a crisis of imagination in a way.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:36:51):**  We need to inoculate our culture.  
**[0:36:55-0:37:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:36:55):**  I mean like, and yeah, and it really starts with ourselves.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:37:03):**  So what does that actually mean?  
**[0:37:05-0:37:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:37:05):**  Well, I start my day reprogramming my mind and setting my intentions and actively working  
**[0:37:15-0:37:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:37:15):**  on goals that are going to bring about this reality.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:37:20):**  Tell me what that looks like for you because everyone has their different practices now,  
**[0:37:24-0:37:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:37:24):**  different sort of mantras and way of thinking and things that they try to achieve in a limited  
**[0:37:31-0:37:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:37:31):**  amount of time.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:37:32):**  So that's one thing that's most democratic about our experience is we've presumably all  
**[0:37:36-0:37:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:37:36):**  got a similar amount of time, certainly in one day.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:37:39):**  So tell me a little bit about your routines and kind of the goals that you're pursuing  
**[0:37:43-0:37:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:37:43):**  through these shifts of consciousness and practice that you yourself are experimenting  
**[0:37:47-0:37:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:37:47):**  with.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:37:48):**  Yeah, so basically we have, I'm actually, you know, I'm an educator so I'm always thinking  
**[0:37:58-0:38:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:37:58):**  about this in terms of spectrums.  
**[0:38:02-0:38:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:38:02):**  I taught in a very politically charged area and so I learned to be really sensitive and  
**[0:38:11-0:38:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:38:11):**  say things like, well, you know, there's a whole spectrum of belief around this concept  
**[0:38:16-0:38:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:38:16):**  ranging from people believing this to people believing that and in the middle people believe  
**[0:38:22-0:38:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:38:22):**  in a combination of those things and such as this and this.  
**[0:38:25-0:38:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:38:25):**  And so I learned to give this spectrum and then create menus.  
**[0:38:31-0:38:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:38:31):**  So I'm actively creating like a menu around all these kinds of concepts that I'm going  
**[0:38:38-0:38:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:38:38):**  to be sharing and doing kind of stuff.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:38:40):**  So I wake up between four o'clock to six o'clock every day and I, depending on what time I  
**[0:38:49-0:38:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:38:49):**  get to bed.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:38:50):**  No, I'm the same way.  
**[0:38:52-0:39:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:38:52):**  Yeah, I try to get seven hours and I try to honor that but I always get up at six.  
**[0:39:00-0:39:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:39:00):**  And so I start my day off, you know, setting my intention.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:39:04):**  I have gratitudes, I have affirmations, I have some visualizations and then I, alright,  
**[0:39:15-0:39:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:39:15):**  so I do a bunch of different things.  
**[0:39:16-0:39:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:39:16):**  If I'm not feeling primed at that moment, I do things until I'm mentally primed and  
**[0:39:24-0:39:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:39:24):**  I try to do them quickly so that I can get on to my meditation.  
**[0:39:29-0:39:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:39:29):**  Though I change things up.  
**[0:39:30-0:39:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:39:30):**  So sometimes like last week, I'll like do like a cardio warm up sort of dance kind of  
**[0:39:38-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:39:38):**  thing.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:39:41):**  And then I will go straight into the Wim Hof breathing method.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:39:45):**  Oh, that's a good one.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:39:46):**  I love that one.  
**[0:39:47-0:39:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:39:47):**  Yeah, to anyone looking at probably looks like I'm now hyperventilating.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:39:51):**  But and then from the outside perspective, it's pretty crazy.  
**[0:39:55-0:39:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:39:55):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:39:56-0:40:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:39:56):**  And so and then and then from there, I go into meditation.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:40:01):**  And so I'm rapidly bringing down just like Tom Bilyeu does, bringing down my level of  
**[0:40:08-0:40:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:40:08):**  my stress levels, my, my heart rate, my breathing, and then calming.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:40:14):**  And then if I flip it around, sometimes I'll start with a meditation and then I'll do halfway  
**[0:40:20-0:40:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:40:20):**  like nearing the end of it, because I've mapped out the 20 minute audio.  
**[0:40:26-0:40:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:40:26):**  I'll start doing the Wim Hof.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:40:28):**  And so I'll finish that 20 minute meditation, like in my Wim Hof zone and then going to  
**[0:40:36-0:40:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:40:36):**  doing yoga in that kind of space.  
**[0:40:40-0:40:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:40:40):**  And then I've got a high, I've got my high performance planner, my Brendon Burchard planner,  
**[0:40:45-0:40:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:40:45):**  which is absolutely ridiculous.  
**[0:40:47-0:40:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:40:47):**  It went like I think in a day was a number one bestseller on Amazon.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:40:51):**  There's a reason for that.  
**[0:40:53-0:40:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:40:53):**  It's just absolutely ridiculously so on point.  
**[0:40:58-0:41:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:40:58):**  And so I use that and then I do my vocal warm up.  
**[0:41:03-0:41:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:41:03):**  I have a Roger Love vocal warm up that I do.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:41:06):**  He, when he was 14, was the vocal coach for Earth, Wind and Fire and the Beach Boys during  
**[0:41:13-0:41:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:41:13):**  the time of good vibration.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:41:14):**  So he's absolutely amazing.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:41:18):**  And so that's, that's part of my performance stuff.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:41:21):**  That's part of my vocal musical kind of stuff.  
**[0:41:25-0:41:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:41:25):**  But it primes me in a really fundamental way.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:41:27):**  It says to my body, you're about to go on stage, get ready.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:41:30):**  And so it just mentally puts me in like a, and before that I was a ski racer.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:41:38):**  And so like watching like Bodie Miller yesterday with my sons, I got a physical reaction.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:41:44):**  My heart rate, like seeing him in the gate, like in the dude dude dude.  
**[0:41:50-0:41:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:41:50):**  Like I just, whoa, even now like my, my heart.  
**[0:41:56-0:41:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:41:56):**  And so like I do things to like absolutely prime myself.  
**[0:41:59-0:42:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:41:59):**  I have a specific set of music that I listen to that like I have a specific song that I'm  
**[0:42:04-0:42:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:42:04):**  like if I'm hedging and not doing my workout immediately, I put on this song and then I'm  
**[0:42:09-0:42:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:42:09):**  going to go do it now.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:42:12):**  And so really kind of, you know, switching my mindset to one where it's, I'm in a fully  
**[0:42:24-0:42:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:42:24):**  resilient phase by the time I start my day.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:42:27):**  And so I start my day setting my mindset, releasing tension mentally, physically, and  
**[0:42:35-0:42:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:42:35):**  then setting my intention for my day on how I want to feel.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:42:40):**  And then I set my intention with my planner, what I want to do, what I want to see in the  
**[0:42:45-0:42:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:42:45):**  world happen.  
**[0:42:47-0:42:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:42:47):**  So it's like you have feelings, who you are, you patch yourself together, you know what  
**[0:42:51-0:42:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:42:51):**  I mean?  
**[0:42:52-0:42:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:42:52):**  And then, and then you're actually doing your to do list kind of stuff, your goals.  
**[0:42:55-0:42:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:42:55):**  And then I routinely throughout my day take breaks every hour.  
**[0:42:59-0:43:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:42:59):**  So I'm doing like Qigong, I'm doing tapping, I'm doing breathing stuff, meditation, like  
**[0:43:05-0:43:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:43:05):**  one to two minutes just to reset my, here's an alarm.  
**[0:43:10-0:43:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:43:10):**  That's one of my alarms.  
**[0:43:15-0:43:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:43:15):**  And then at night, you know, I'm doing gratitude journals.  
**[0:43:19-0:43:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:43:19):**  I'm doing a reflection, a set reflection I do at the end of the night.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:43:25):**  And the crazy thing is, I really do believe these practices are the way that we're going  
**[0:43:32-0:43:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:43:32):**  to get permaculture adopted, the way that we're going to help people make these actions  
**[0:43:38-0:43:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:43:38):**  in their lives.  
**[0:43:40-0:43:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:43:40):**  And because, I mean, think about how many people out there have taken a PDC and then  
**[0:43:43-0:43:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:43:43):**  done nothing, or done a PDC and then just made a garden and thought that was it.  
**[0:43:54-0:43:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:43:54):**  And like that's the problem is we need permaculture to go beyond the garden, beyond the homestead,  
**[0:43:59-0:44:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:43:59):**  beyond the, I'm the lone, you know, person in the woods.  
**[0:44:05-0:44:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:44:05):**  It needs to go into the cities.  
**[0:44:06-0:44:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:44:06):**  We need to be using all the natural modalities that permaculture highlights to inoculate  
**[0:44:18-0:44:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:44:18):**  all of our systems so that they can actually become regenerative.  
**[0:44:22-0:44:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:44:22):**  So that you start a garbage company that people sign up for because it has real values.  
**[0:44:28-0:44:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:44:28):**  Because they're like, oh no, this garbage company represents me in plus.  
**[0:44:31-0:44:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:44:31):**  Did you watch their commercial?  
**[0:44:32-0:44:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:44:32):**  No, those other guys are actually recycling and they didn't even tell me.  
**[0:44:36-0:44:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:44:36):**  Yeah.  
**[0:44:37-0:44:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:44:37):**  What are they doing with that plastic?  
**[0:44:39-0:44:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:44:39):**  I don't trust them any longer.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:44:41):**  I really love this insight into your process and sort of illustrating why it is that you  
**[0:44:47-0:44:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:44:47):**  are trying to cultivate this change in mindset.  
**[0:44:49-0:44:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:44:49):**  Because like you just mentioned, you could get the class and go out and do a garden and  
**[0:44:54-0:44:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:44:54):**  see that as sort of the apex and not do much more with it.  
**[0:44:58-0:45:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:44:58):**  But this concept of using the principles of permaculture and the mindset that it cultivates  
**[0:45:04-0:45:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:45:04):**  as a guide for a lifestyle, not simply a list of techniques to implement, you know, soil  
**[0:45:11-0:45:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:45:11):**  building or food growing, but rather a perspective that informs your decisions and acts as a  
**[0:45:19-0:45:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:45:19):**  compass for, you know, the steps that you take in your life, the way you interact with  
**[0:45:25-0:45:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:45:25):**  your community, the way you educate yourself and interact with everything around you.  
**[0:45:30-0:45:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:45:30):**  This is also like there's so many parallels between your morning routines and things that  
**[0:45:35-0:45:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:45:35):**  I do on a daily basis as well.  
**[0:45:37-0:45:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:45:37):**  Clearly we're on a very similar wavelength and it's really cool to see.  
**[0:45:40-0:45:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:45:40):**  Now let's go one generation back.  
**[0:45:44-0:45:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:45:44):**  And I know that you're very actively involved with this within your own family.  
**[0:45:48-0:45:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:45:48):**  But what do you help to encourage within their development that helps to cultivate this mindset  
**[0:45:53-0:45:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:45:53):**  that you're also working on developing for yourself?  
**[0:45:57-0:45:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:45:57):**  Hmm.  
**[0:45:58-0:46:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:45:58):**  Yeah, so I'm teaching my boys to meditate, yoga, but it's a lot more than just like the  
**[0:46:08-0:46:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:46:08):**  act of doing it.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:46:10):**  It's really the objective.  
**[0:46:11-0:46:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:46:11):**  So we could sit here and just breathe and, you know, and just do the exercise, you know,  
**[0:46:18-0:46:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:46:18):**  try to hold real still as the objective, you know.  
**[0:46:20-0:46:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:46:20):**  But what we're really trying to do is learn to be objective about our thoughts so that  
**[0:46:33-0:46:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:46:33):**  we can be that patient observer that looks at the landscape and lets the landscape speak  
**[0:46:40-0:46:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:46:40):**  to them.  
**[0:46:41-0:46:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:46:41):**  It's the same thing with the situation with our minds and our emotions and even our plans.  
**[0:46:47-0:46:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:46:47):**  If we can let our mind yabber on for a little bit and run through those ideas and not just  
**[0:46:54-0:47:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:46:54):**  take the first one that raises its hand, you tend to see that your ideas are a collection  
**[0:47:00-0:47:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:47:00):**  of echoes and reactions for the most part to things that have already happened to you,  
**[0:47:07-0:47:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:47:07):**  sometimes happened to you long, long ago and you're like, wow, that's like my dad used  
**[0:47:11-0:47:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:47:11):**  to say or like that came from like my mom or a teacher or a fear or, you know, and so  
**[0:47:20-0:47:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:47:20):**  it really is a way of applying the permaculture principles to your life.  
**[0:47:27-0:47:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:47:27):**  And so it may be different for me than some people because I rewrote the ethics in some  
**[0:47:37-0:47:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:47:37):**  ways.  
**[0:47:38-0:47:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:47:38):**  So I changed it to future care, not knowing that other people were doing this too at the  
**[0:47:44-0:47:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:47:44):**  same exact time.  
**[0:47:46-0:47:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:47:46):**  Starhawk changed it to people care before me.  
**[0:47:50-0:47:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:47:50):**  She heard in Africa at AI Convergence they were doing that and she liked the sound of  
**[0:47:54-0:47:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:47:54):**  it.  
**[0:47:55-0:47:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:47:55):**  For me, it suddenly solved everything.  
**[0:47:57-0:48:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:47:57):**  All the debates over all the little minutia got fixed and then I was like, well, fair  
**[0:48:04-0:48:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:48:04):**  share is part of people care, isn't it, you know what I mean?  
**[0:48:08-0:48:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:48:08):**  And then care of future and earth care has its own return or surplus implicit in it too.  
**[0:48:15-0:48:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:48:15):**  And then so care of future really is the management, the planning and the investment into the care  
**[0:48:23-0:48:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:48:23):**  of the earth and people.  
**[0:48:26-0:48:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:48:26):**  And so once I like had that kind of that leap, I really realized that we had not been looking  
**[0:48:34-0:48:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:48:34):**  at these things clearly enough and that we really needed to look at social permaculture  
**[0:48:43-0:48:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:48:43):**  more carefully.  
**[0:48:44-0:48:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:48:44):**  And that's why I created this social permaculture principles because they didn't exist.  
**[0:48:50-0:48:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:48:50):**  And I was inspired by Darren Doherty's handbook.  
**[0:48:52-0:49:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:48:52):**  I mean, he had these like sayings of like wisdoms like from all these different people  
**[0:49:01-0:49:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:49:01):**  and he just kind of put them in front as just things that he just wanted to get published  
**[0:49:05-0:49:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:49:05):**  so that they would be down, you know, on paper.  
**[0:49:10-0:49:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:49:10):**  And they of course connected to his work because that's part of who he is, part of his meaning.  
**[0:49:15-0:49:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:49:15):**  But for me, I was like, I just saw all the elements of an actual like I saw what was  
**[0:49:23-0:49:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:49:23):**  lying underneath each of the person's different semantics and verbiage.  
**[0:49:27-0:49:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:49:27):**  And so I was like, well, there's more here.  
**[0:49:31-0:49:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:49:31):**  And so I just started running through it and started iterating it out.  
**[0:49:33-0:49:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:49:33):**  And then I just started seeing all these other other aspects as I myself have had to conquer  
**[0:49:41-0:49:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:49:41):**  these things.  
**[0:49:43-0:49:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:49:43):**  My wife, depending on how you count, has faced cancer like five to six times now.  
**[0:49:51-0:49:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:49:51):**  And it used to be three for many, many years.  
**[0:49:55-0:49:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:49:55):**  So it's been super hard.  
**[0:49:58-0:50:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:49:58):**  So for me, I just know so many of us are dealing with things like loved ones having to face  
**[0:50:07-0:50:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:50:07):**  cancer.  
**[0:50:10-0:50:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:50:10):**  And the resiliency that we need to face these sort of things is exactly the resiliency that  
**[0:50:17-0:50:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:50:17):**  we all need right now because almost everyone has a loved one that's facing cancer.  
**[0:50:23-0:50:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:50:23):**  Almost everyone has an autoimmune issue right now.  
**[0:50:27-0:50:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:50:27):**  I mean, or a child or a loved one that does.  
**[0:50:30-0:50:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:50:30):**  I mean, it's real right now.  
**[0:50:34-0:50:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:50:34):**  And the number one key to all this is to have a good attitude, which is the number one hardest  
**[0:50:42-0:50:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:50:42):**  thing to do.  
**[0:50:43-0:50:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:50:43):**  To be enthusiastic when you've got cancer.  
**[0:50:47-0:50:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:50:47):**  Or it's opposite what you naturally feel like reacting.  
**[0:50:55-0:51:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:50:55):**  And so in my own life, I've realized that this is exactly the situation that permaculture  
**[0:51:02-0:51:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:51:02):**  is in, where on one hand, we're going to give you the truth of what's going on in our world  
**[0:51:07-0:51:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:51:07):**  and it's going to be bitter, it's going to be difficult, it's going to be heart wrenching  
**[0:51:10-0:51:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:51:10):**  and so scary and all this stuff.  
**[0:51:12-0:51:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:51:12):**  Then we're going to give you the solutions.  
**[0:51:16-0:51:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:51:16):**  But then you got to live it.  
**[0:51:18-0:51:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:51:18):**  And it's like, it's that leap, then you got to live it.  
**[0:51:21-0:51:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:51:21):**  That is very difficult for people.  
**[0:51:23-0:51:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:51:23):**  And it's the same exact thing with cancer.  
**[0:51:27-0:51:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:51:27):**  It's like, okay, you've got cancer, now you got to fight it.  
**[0:51:29-0:51:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:51:29):**  And they're like, wait, I've got cancer?  
**[0:51:32-0:51:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:51:32):**  And they can't and they've got to get over that first.  
**[0:51:35-0:51:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:51:35):**  And so, and my students, the greatest problem I saw them having is them believing their  
**[0:51:42-0:51:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:51:42):**  limitations.  
**[0:51:43-0:51:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:51:43):**  So I had these students, you know, in the sixth most violent county in North America,  
**[0:51:47-0:51:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:51:47):**  right?  
**[0:51:48-0:51:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:51:48):**  Well, the reality is I was teaching them NYU stuff.  
**[0:51:51-0:51:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:51:51):**  So they're performing and understanding concepts at such a high level, but they'll never be  
**[0:51:56-0:51:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:51:56):**  able to access those opportunities.  
**[0:51:59-0:52:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:51:59):**  And so like my whole thing was trying to prove to them how amazing they really were.  
**[0:52:04-0:52:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:52:04):**  And many of them just didn't believe me.  
**[0:52:07-0:52:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:52:07):**  And it's like that belief literally is the fuel of your individual superpower.  
**[0:52:13-0:52:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:52:13):**  And it's like, Charles Eisenstein talked about this in my interview with them, about how  
**[0:52:19-0:52:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:52:19):**  if you love something, you'll either pick up naturally and do naturally the right thing,  
**[0:52:28-0:52:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:52:28):**  or you'll do the research and the work to figure out what the right thing is.  
**[0:52:33-0:52:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:52:33):**  And it won't be like doing just enough care.  
**[0:52:37-0:52:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:52:37):**  Like if the government's telling you, you must do this, or we're all will die, or your  
**[0:52:41-0:52:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:52:41):**  child will die or something like that.  
**[0:52:43-0:52:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:52:43):**  If you're a neglectful parent, the reality is that if it comes from a place of love,  
**[0:52:49-0:52:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:52:49):**  it's a lexicon of love.  
**[0:52:52-0:52:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:52:52):**  It's not like binary love.  
**[0:52:56-0:52:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:52:56):**  It's exponential expressions.  
**[0:52:58-0:53:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:52:58):**  And so when we inoculate these places with our best selves, with love, with community,  
**[0:53:07-0:53:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:53:07):**  with real connection, with family, we open up our greatest potential as human beings.  
**[0:53:15-0:53:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:53:15):**  And so I really feel strong.  
**[0:53:18-0:53:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:53:18):**  And that's why I'm writing this book called Unstoppable Enthusiasm.  
**[0:53:21-0:53:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:53:21):**  I'm doing a Kickstarter for it in February because I feel like that's the catalyst that's  
**[0:53:28-0:53:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:53:28):**  missing that's holding people back from so many permaculturists and individuals in general  
**[0:53:36-0:53:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:53:36):**  from living a life of love and expression of love.  
**[0:53:40-0:53:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:53:40):**  So they take the time and care to grow their own food because it is an expression of self  
**[0:53:46-0:53:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:53:46):**  love when you get down to it.  
**[0:53:48-0:53:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:53:48):**  If you do not care for yourself, you're not going to go out and view a garden.  
**[0:53:55-0:53:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:53:55):**  You know, so there's so much to this.  
**[0:53:59-0:54:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:53:59):**  And so there certainly is.  
**[0:54:00-0:54:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:54:00):**  Yeah.  
**[0:54:01-0:54:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:54:01):**  So that's a very powerful and inspiring message.  
**[0:54:04-0:54:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:54:04):**  But before we run out of time here, I would really love for you to focus a little bit  
**[0:54:09-0:54:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:54:09):**  on some of the content that you've put out recently, your online educational platform  
**[0:54:14-0:54:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:54:14):**  that really offers the tangible information and the tools that people are going to need  
**[0:54:20-0:54:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:54:20):**  to positively interact with this shift and this switch to a regenerative economy.  
**[0:54:25-0:54:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:54:25):**  Can you break that down for us?  
**[0:54:26-0:54:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:54:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:54:27-0:54:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:54:27):**  Sorry if I go.  
**[0:54:28-0:54:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:54:28):**  I just go on tanden.  
**[0:54:29-0:54:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:54:29):**  No, no, not at all.  
**[0:54:30-0:54:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:54:30):**  We'll definitely do a follow up again really soon and we'll explore these in more detail.  
**[0:54:35-0:54:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:54:35):**  But I want to give you a chance to to explain this to people who undoubtedly are going to  
**[0:54:39-0:54:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:54:39):**  want to use this information in their own lives.  
**[0:54:42-0:54:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:54:42):**  Yeah.  
**[0:54:43-0:54:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:54:43):**  And so part of the reason why I'm so tangential is because the amount of information in my  
**[0:54:47-0:54:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:54:47):**  head is is encyclopedic at this point.  
**[0:54:52-0:55:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:54:52):**  So I've done over 150 hours of video in the past year on advanced permaculture and all  
**[0:55:00-0:55:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:55:00):**  based on peer reviewed a peer reviewed textbook that I wrote took two years to write and then  
**[0:55:06-0:55:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:55:06):**  took six months to create a new edition to.  
**[0:55:11-0:55:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:55:11):**  I mean basically I've been able to update where permaculture was with the PDC with Bill  
**[0:55:20-0:55:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:55:20):**  Mollison's work in 1988.  
**[0:55:22-0:55:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:55:22):**  It's amazing.  
**[0:55:23-0:55:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:55:23):**  It's groundbreaking.  
**[0:55:25-0:55:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:55:25):**  It's historical.  
**[0:55:26-0:55:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:55:26):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:55:27-0:55:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:55:27):**  Don't get me wrong.  
**[0:55:29-0:55:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:55:29):**  But nonetheless there's no mycology in there like to speak of comparatively to what we  
**[0:55:37-0:55:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:55:37):**  have nowadays.  
**[0:55:39-0:55:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:55:39):**  Our understanding of carbon sequestration is absent.  
**[0:55:42-0:55:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:55:42):**  Our understanding of renewable energy is absent and also through energy generation in non-conventional  
**[0:55:52-0:55:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:55:52):**  like renewable ways.  
**[0:55:54-0:55:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:55:54):**  So like the Trump.  
**[0:55:55-0:55:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:55:55):**  The Trump you know wasn't included.  
**[0:55:59-0:56:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:55:59):**  He mentions that later on there's videos.  
**[0:56:00-0:56:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:56:00):**  Totally.  
**[0:56:01-0:56:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:56:01):**  Don't get me wrong.  
**[0:56:02-0:56:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:56:02):**  But it's not there in like the permatexture section or renewable energy section.  
**[0:56:08-0:56:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:56:08):**  And then there were no social permaculture principles.  
**[0:56:11-0:56:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:56:11):**  So anyway there's just so much stuff.  
**[0:56:14-0:56:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:56:14):**  Dr. Elaine Ingham is updating her soil classes now and it's been six years since she updated  
**[0:56:22-0:56:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:56:22):**  them.  
**[0:56:23-0:56:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:56:23):**  She's like there's just so much information.  
**[0:56:24-0:56:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:56:24):**  I've just got to record everything and rewrite all my books.  
**[0:56:28-0:56:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:56:28):**  And this is only six years of time.  
**[0:56:31-0:56:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:56:31):**  And yes I mean I updated my book because there was new research that came out within a year.  
**[0:56:36-0:56:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:56:36):**  So the pace that things are changing really requires us to take a very different stance  
**[0:56:43-0:56:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:56:43):**  with the information.  
**[0:56:45-0:56:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:56:45):**  And so I just applied peer reviewers.  
**[0:56:49-0:56:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:56:49):**  I just looked up the citations for the information that Bill had.  
**[0:56:53-0:56:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:56:53):**  They were all out of date or out of print and impossible to buy for like you know $900  
**[0:56:58-0:57:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:56:58):**  a book.  
**[0:57:00-0:57:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:57:00):**  And so I just started talking to real professors, experts, professionals in the modern world  
**[0:57:07-0:57:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:57:07):**  and I got completely new information.  
**[0:57:10-0:57:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:57:10):**  And then I stumbled onto ocean restoration.  
**[0:57:13-0:57:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:57:13):**  And so I mean 70 percent of the earth is ocean.  
**[0:57:17-0:57:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:57:17):**  If we're not doing riparian ocean restoration as permaculture we have missed the boat entirely  
**[0:57:22-0:57:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:57:22):**  in permaculture if we haven't done this.  
**[0:57:25-0:57:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:57:25):**  So so definitely so for me this was like like a historical moment for me.  
**[0:57:32-0:57:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:57:32):**  And I mean a lot of people would check out my stuff.  
**[0:57:34-0:57:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:57:34):**  They're like holy cow this is it.  
**[0:57:35-0:57:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:57:35):**  This is it.  
**[0:57:36-0:57:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:57:36):**  And that's what Rosemary Morrow who's a peer of Bill Moulton who's probably taught more  
**[0:57:42-0:57:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:57:42):**  people than Bill Moulton actually.  
**[0:57:44-0:57:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:57:44):**  She's the one who got permaculture included in the training of government officials in  
**[0:57:50-0:57:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:57:50):**  Cambodia in several other countries.  
**[0:57:54-0:57:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:57:54):**  She's been using permaculture and humanitarian aid situations for decades.  
**[0:57:59-0:58:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:57:59):**  And now she's using my materials.  
**[0:58:01-0:58:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:58:01):**  And currently things are being translated so they can be used for my Arabic version  
**[0:58:08-0:58:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:58:08):**  to the language that's most commonly used in Afghanistan.  
**[0:58:11-0:58:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:58:11):**  And then that's going to be translated into Farsi and Iran.  
**[0:58:15-0:58:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:58:15):**  So there's a bunch of things happening right now.  
**[0:58:18-0:58:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:58:18):**  But basically I stepped in and realized that there was no curriculum for kids.  
**[0:58:24-0:58:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:58:24):**  And I know there's some stuff for teachers but that's not for kids.  
**[0:58:28-0:58:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:58:28):**  And so I'm a I'm a public school teacher.  
**[0:58:31-0:58:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:58:31):**  And so I went in there and created the textbook that showed the information that was written  
**[0:58:36-0:58:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:58:36):**  accessible for those age groups.  
**[0:58:38-0:58:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:58:38):**  I did middle school.  
**[0:58:39-0:58:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:58:39):**  I did high school slash college.  
**[0:58:41-0:58:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:58:41):**  People are saying my high school is a pretty advanced high school slash college.  
**[0:58:47-0:58:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:58:47):**  But I also have people using it in middle schools with a teacher there adapting parts  
**[0:58:52-0:58:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:58:52):**  of it.  
**[0:58:54-0:58:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:58:54):**  So that's what I created.  
**[0:58:55-0:58:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:58:55):**  But then people were like man we need lesson plans.  
**[0:58:58-0:58:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:58:58):**  And so I was like oh right.  
**[0:58:59-0:59:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:58:59):**  Yeah OK.  
**[0:59:00-0:59:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:59:00):**  OK.  
**[0:59:01-0:59:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:59:01):**  Because I always just made my own.  
**[0:59:02-0:59:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:59:02):**  And so when I went to set out to make them I realized there was no education standards  
**[0:59:07-0:59:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:59:07):**  in permaculture which for all professional educators it's impossible to create a lesson  
**[0:59:13-0:59:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:59:13):**  plan because you need to align using your standards your objectives to your activities  
**[0:59:20-0:59:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:59:20):**  to your assessments and then you've got to align that to your learning objective you're  
**[0:59:25-0:59:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:59:25):**  learning modalities of your students how they learn.  
**[0:59:27-0:59:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:59:27):**  You know so for me as a professional educator I was like oh man I've got to I've got to  
**[0:59:33-0:59:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:59:33):**  remake the wheel.  
**[0:59:34-0:59:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:59:34):**  And so that's why I did you know public comment and review page for the standards.  
**[0:59:39-0:59:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:59:39):**  We went through that process and now actually as of today I'm going to be printing out one  
**[0:59:45-0:59:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:59:45):**  of you sent I'm sending the printers to print out the first copy the test copy of the Advanced  
**[0:59:53-1:00:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=0:59:53):**  Permaculture Student Teachers Guide with the first K through 12 standards ever created  
**[1:00:00-1:00:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:00:00):**  there.  
**[1:00:01-1:00:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:00:01):**  They've been open for public review and common educators are using them in schools Olympia  
**[1:00:08-1:00:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:00:08):**  High School in Washington is using them.  
**[1:00:12-1:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:00:12):**  My materials are being used in dozens and dozens of schools all over America.  
**[1:00:18-1:00:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:00:18):**  So this is really happening.  
**[1:00:21-1:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:00:21):**  I've got online programs K through 12 programs adult programs I've got advanced programs.  
**[1:00:27-1:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:00:27):**  My advanced permaculture certification program is as again unique.  
**[1:00:33-1:00:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:00:33):**  I've set it up so that instead of a piece of paper for your PDC you actually make a  
**[1:00:39-1:00:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:00:39):**  project.  
**[1:00:40-1:00:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:00:40):**  So it's a conversation piece and it represents you your unique style of permaculture your  
**[1:00:47-1:00:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:00:47):**  dreams your visions.  
**[1:00:49-1:00:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:00:49):**  And so people you know there when people talk about getting certified you know people ask  
**[1:00:54-1:00:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:00:54):**  you what would you learn from.  
**[1:00:57-1:01:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:00:57):**  But the reality is when it's an actual project the proof is in the pudding.  
**[1:01:02-1:01:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:01:02):**  It speaks for itself.  
**[1:01:03-1:01:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:01:03):**  And so the student becomes the focus and their project becomes the focus rather than the  
**[1:01:08-1:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:01:08):**  teacher and which guru you know you learn from because it's really about the student.  
**[1:01:14-1:01:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:01:14):**  It's really about empowerment and it's really about connecting you to the skills behaviors  
**[1:01:21-1:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:01:21):**  and information that allows you to unlock your best self.  
**[1:01:25-1:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:01:25):**  And that's really why I've done things the way I've done because it's a holistic kind  
**[1:01:31-1:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:01:31):**  of thing I mean you've got to be coaching that person as a whole and you can't just  
**[1:01:35-1:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:01:35):**  be coaching their gardening skills.  
**[1:01:38-1:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:01:38):**  Yeah of course.  
**[1:01:39-1:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:01:39):**  Man I really agree with all of this I'm extremely excited about this addition to the resource  
**[1:01:44-1:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:01:44):**  all the updates that you've made.  
**[1:01:46-1:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:01:46):**  Can you tell people how to find this resource and where they can contact you and sign up.  
**[1:01:51-1:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:01:51):**  Yeah.  
**[1:01:52-1:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:01:52):**  If you go to the permaculturestudent.com I've got my my textbook The Permaculture Student  
**[1:01:57-1:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:01:57):**  2 which is the advanced textbook that's for free on there.  
**[1:02:00-1:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:02:00):**  It's a human right to know this information so I don't hold that back at all.  
**[1:02:05-1:02:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:02:05):**  I've got all my courses on there all my books on there.  
**[1:02:08-1:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:02:08):**  There's a donation page on there if you feel so inclined you can download the e-books through  
**[1:02:14-1:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:02:14):**  that.  
**[1:02:15-1:02:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:02:15):**  There's free videos.  
**[1:02:18-1:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:02:18):**  I've just tried to make it really so that everyone at whatever level they're at can  
**[1:02:23-1:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:02:23):**  get involved.  
**[1:02:24-1:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:02:24):**  I have courses I have you know payment plans where it's like 50% off and $50 a month.  
**[1:02:30-1:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:02:30):**  I really want to empower people so that they can inoculate their community with resiliency  
**[1:02:39-1:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:02:39):**  and economic empowerment too.  
**[1:02:41-1:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:02:41):**  I mean don't get me wrong.  
**[1:02:43-1:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:02:43):**  I love you know CSAs and gardening and growing food and selling food and all this.  
**[1:02:50-1:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:02:50):**  I want it all though.  
**[1:02:52-1:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:02:52):**  I want I want you know your inner peace I want your financial peace I want your community  
**[1:02:57-1:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:02:57):**  peace and family peace.  
**[1:02:59-1:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:02:59):**  So that's really what we are all about and I feel very fortunate to be kind of at the  
**[1:03:10-1:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:03:10):**  at the facilitative head.  
**[1:03:12-1:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:03:12):**  I don't want to say at the helm but at the facilitative head of this really unbelievable  
**[1:03:17-1:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:03:17):**  community where we have in the advanced course we have over 70 educators involved.  
**[1:03:24-1:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:03:24):**  So I'm just the lead educator.  
**[1:03:26-1:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:03:26):**  We've got experts from all PhDs from all walks of life.  
**[1:03:30-1:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:03:30):**  We've got doctors.  
**[1:03:31-1:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:03:31):**  We've got you know people who work medically.  
**[1:03:35-1:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:03:35):**  People who work with just soil.  
**[1:03:36-1:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:03:36):**  People who work with just fungi you know.  
**[1:03:38-1:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:03:38):**  We've got the specialists and it's people are saying that it's a life-changing course  
**[1:03:45-1:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:03:45):**  and they thought they knew permaculture before they knew science and nature before they've  
**[1:03:50-1:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:03:50):**  taken Jeff Lawton's course.  
**[1:03:51-1:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:03:51):**  They've taken PDCs in the local area bioregionally whatnot.  
**[1:03:56-1:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:03:56):**  People some of them have taken multiple PDCs but everyone is saying the same thing that  
**[1:04:00-1:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:04:00):**  they've never taken a course like this before.  
**[1:04:02-1:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:04:02):**  Well I have no doubt that it's every bit as valuable as you say.  
**[1:04:06-1:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:04:06):**  I'm really looking forward to exploring some of this content as well.  
**[1:04:09-1:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:04:09):**  Unfortunately I've got to run and give a farm tour here in just a second but I've already  
**[1:04:14-1:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:04:14):**  know what we're going to cover the next time we talk.  
**[1:04:16-1:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:04:16):**  Unfortunately this is actually our last interview for the second season of our podcast.  
**[1:04:21-1:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:04:21):**  I'm so honored to have had you on here again this season and I'm looking forward to talking  
**[1:04:26-1:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:04:26):**  to you again real soon.  
**[1:04:27-1:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:04:27):**  I hate to cut you short but I know we're going to connect again real soon.  
**[1:04:31-1:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:04:31):**  So Matt it's been such a pleasure talking to you.  
**[1:04:33-1:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:04:33):**  Let's let's catch up again soon.  
**[1:04:35-1:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:04:35):**  Sounds perfect.  
**[1:04:37-1:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:04:37):**  Thank you so much Oliver.  
**[1:04:38-1:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-matt-powers-1/#t=1:04:38):**  It is my pleasure.

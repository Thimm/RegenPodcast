**[0:06:37-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:06:37):**  in much of the world.

**[0:06:46-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:06:46):**  in hand with how we're using water and how we're pursuing agriculture, so we can definitely

**[0:07:07-0:07:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:07:07):**  about very much in media circles, but they are major issues that are coming to the forefront  
**[0:07:14-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:07:14):**  now.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:07:15):**  Yeah, considering how much water topsoil is able to hold within it, I would imagine that  
**[0:07:21-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:07:21):**  yeah, like you said, erosion doesn't end up as kind of the headline issues that people  
**[0:07:27-0:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:07:27):**  try to tackle, but is absolutely essential for bringing larger amounts of water and storing

**[0:07:48-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:07:48):**  levels of the soil which can regenerate aquifers and other sources, correct?  
**[0:07:54-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:07:54):**  Yes, and that's just sort of a logical strategy is holding things up higher in the landscape  
**[0:08:00-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:08:00):**  and holding it in the soil is just, you know, it just makes sense when you stop and you  
**[0:08:05-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:08:05):**  think about it, so you know, some of the places I've been in the world, I've got projects  
**[0:08:12-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:08:12):**  that I'd like to go back to and continue the work in the regions and I just think, well  
**[0:08:19-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:08:19):**  okay, I'd really like to be stopping up at the top of the mountain ranges and work there  
**[0:08:26-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:08:26):**  and I know then we'll get more water downhill, but these are, you know, some of the work  
**[0:08:31-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:08:31):**  I've done in India, it's just, it's emotionally draining to go there to see how desperate  
**[0:08:38-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:08:38):**  the water situation is in a place that should be like a dry tropical region but becoming  
**[0:08:45-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:08:45):**  semi-arid and even some areas becoming desert as well, it's just kind of frightening.  
**[0:08:52-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:08:52):**  Yeah, certainly, I mean this can basically impact an entire bioregion if not watershed  
**[0:09:00-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:09:00):**  and like you were saying, you want to try and start up as high as possible on the source,  
**[0:09:06-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:09:06):**  but without having access to those parts, there's only so much that can be done down  
**[0:09:12-0:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:09:12):**  at later levels to have a real impact.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:09:15):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:09:17):**  In the book, one of the things I consider to be a water harvesting earthwork is trees,  
**[0:09:22-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:09:22):**  so I've got a little chapter on trees in there, but really there's a friend of mine in this  
**[0:09:28-0:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:09:28):**  particular region in India who's got just a brilliant NGO where he's been doing what

**[0:09:40-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:09:40):**  know, if I could ever get back there with his help, we could start making some major  
**[0:09:47-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:09:47):**  impact on the hydrological system in that area.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:09:52):**  That's great, well let's hope that that can be made to happen.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:09:55):**  So before you ever get started digging and implementing your designs, can you tell us  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:10:00):**  a little about how you go about mapping the land and assessing the water harvesting potential  
**[0:10:05-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:10:05):**  of a site?  
**[0:10:06-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:10:06):**  Yeah, well first and foremost is your climate.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:10:12):**  So if it's a dry land, you can have a much bigger impact.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:10:18):**  It can be much easier to see what you're doing after, you know, just after the first rainfall,  
**[0:10:25-0:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:10:25):**  but there is a bit of an issue, I think, in permaculture with people just kind of going  
**[0:10:31-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:10:31):**  willy-nilly and stopping the water.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:10:36):**  Maybe it's not fair to put that all on permaculture.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:10:39):**  Let's take the example of Australia where the use of farm dams has exploded over the  
**[0:10:46-0:10:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:10:46):**  past, let's say, 30, 40 years and it's to the point where it's starting to have significant  
**[0:10:54-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:10:54):**  impact on the watersheds in Australia and they've introduced legislation now that, you  
**[0:11:00-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:11:00):**  know, it really limits what you can do on a landscape.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:11:04):**  So we do have to be careful.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:11:07):**  We have to think about the water rights of other people downstream.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:11:12):**  So we don't just want to grab everything and stop the whole system.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:11:18):**  In the same token, we can't pin it all on dams.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:11:24):**  I don't believe that Australia would be in the pickle that it's in at the moment if they  
**[0:11:31-0:11:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:11:31):**  didn't have the land clearing post-World War II that they did for agriculture.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:11:36):**  So what they did was they cleared massive amounts of eucalyptus forest for the sake  
**[0:11:42-0:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:11:42):**  of vegetable and agricultural production.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:11:47):**  So going back to trees again, I consider them to be water harvesting elements.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:11:52):**  If you do that, you are going to dry up your landscape and we just see that lesson being  
**[0:11:58-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:11:58):**  taught again and again around the world.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:12:01):**  Cut the trees, you're going to reduce water.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:12:06):**  So that's, well, getting back to your question, that's sort of the first thing is being careful.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:12:11):**  Yeah, we can think about what elements can be beneficial on site, but also be cognizant  
**[0:12:18-0:12:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:12:18):**  of the fact that people downstream, their first instinct is to consider you stealing  
**[0:12:24-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:12:24):**  their water.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:12:26):**  So you want to be careful about that.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:12:27):**  You'd like to design a system that doesn't just stop water but rehydrates the landscape  
**[0:12:34-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:12:34):**  and eventually provides them with more.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:12:37):**  You have to implement these things gradually so you're not suddenly tying up a bunch of  
**[0:12:42-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:12:42):**  runoff that they would have had otherwise.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:12:46):**  So it needs to be phased in.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:12:48):**  But then again, when it comes to broader planning, safety is a major concern for me.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:12:57):**  When I think about anything, I just imagine, okay, we'll put in system X, whatever it involves,

**[0:13:19-0:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:13:19):**  out and the whole thing washes down?  
**[0:13:22-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:13:22):**  So I like to assume everything is going to fail.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:13:24):**  I build it so that it won't, but assume that it will for safety's sake.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:13:30):**  And then the other issue is the kind of soil you're on, how safe is it, how stable is it,  
**[0:13:37-0:13:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:13:37):**  and does your region have a history of landslides?  
**[0:13:40-0:13:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:13:40):**  And then I just get more and more cautious that way.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:13:43):**  There are regions here in Ontario that I just take the safe approach and I don't recommend  
**[0:13:50-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:13:50):**  doing any earthworks on them at all.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:13:54):**  That's sort of my approach.  
**[0:13:56-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:13:56):**  If there's any specific questions, I'd be happy to try and address them.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:13:59):**  Yeah, of course.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:14:00):**  So let's talk a little bit more about the dangers or the risk of overharvesting water  
**[0:14:05-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:14:05):**  on a landscape and how can you mitigate that?  
**[0:14:09-0:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:14:09):**  How can you assess it to begin with?  
**[0:14:12-0:14:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:14:12):**  And then how can you implement certain aspects that will help to rehydrate the landscape  
**[0:14:18-0:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:14:18):**  without sending it over the tipping point or causing any undue risk?  
**[0:14:23-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:14:23):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:14:24):**  Well, Australia again is a good example.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:14:27):**  They've got some, what are essentially floodwater catchment systems in some of their, well,  
**[0:14:38-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:14:38):**  some of the tributaries of the Murray River.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:14:42):**  And there's a large one which of course, because I want to talk about it, I can't remember  
**[0:14:47-0:14:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:14:47):**  the name at the moment, but it captures quite a large amount of water going through this  
**[0:14:54-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:14:54):**  one tributary and has a very, very noticeable measurable impact on the amount of water downstream.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:15:03):**  So the water flowing through the lower reaches of the Murray River are significantly decreased  
**[0:15:11-0:15:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:15:11):**  by this.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:15:12):**  So that kind of harvesting is happening very, very low in the watershed in the sense that  
**[0:15:23-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:15:23):**  it's happening right on the river itself.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:15:26):**  So that will have the biggest effect on the amount of water that's taken out of the watershed.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:15:33):**  So the higher up in the landscape you have, not only the more potential do you have to  
**[0:15:40-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:15:40):**  hydrate the landscape, but also the less of an impact you're going to have on river flow.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:15:47):**  So that's sort of step number one.  
**[0:15:51-0:16:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:15:51):**  I did have a guy recently contact me from East Africa, I think it was Somaliland, and  
**[0:16:00-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:16:00):**  he had, well, he said, what can you do?  
**[0:16:04-0:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:16:04):**  And I said, well, you know, I'd have to understand I have to consult at a distance.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:16:09):**  So take everything I say, not as a prescription, but as an idea.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:16:13):**  He got that, he was comfortable with it.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:16:15):**  But I looked at his site on Google Earth, and it was just kind of one of these sites  
**[0:16:20-0:16:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:16:20):**  where you look at it and you think, oh, God, it's kind of depressing.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:16:24):**  You're like, people live here?  
**[0:16:27-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:16:27):**  It's possible.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:16:30):**  And you know, I had some suggestions revolving around spade irrigation, which is just what  
**[0:16:38-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:16:38):**  I was talking about, which is flood catchment irrigation.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:16:42):**  But I, you know, with plenty of warnings saying, okay, well, this is traditional stuff that's  
**[0:16:47-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:16:47):**  done in your area.  
**[0:16:49-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:16:49):**  However, there is the huge potential for overharvesting and making some very upset neighbors downstream.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:17:00):**  There wasn't much in the way of evidence of people living sort of downstream from where  
**[0:17:05-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:17:05):**  he was, but I'm sure, you know, nomadic people moving through the landscape would rely on  
**[0:17:13-0:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:17:13):**  the water that does flow through.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:17:15):**  So you know, I say make everything small scale, if you can.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:17:20):**  And you know, he was certainly familiar with permaculture.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:17:25):**  He'd taken, I think, Jeff Lawton's online course and kind of had an understanding that,  
**[0:17:31-0:17:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:17:31):**  you know, you don't build mega projects.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:17:37):**  So in areas like that that are at extreme risk, what are some safety measures that you  
**[0:17:42-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:17:42):**  can put in?  
**[0:17:43-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:17:43):**  Like, for example, where I am here in Guatemala, we're in a valley among a lot of mountains  
**[0:17:49-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:17:49):**  that empties out into a large lake.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:17:52):**  And every year during the rainy season or if a hurricane comes through, which only happens  
**[0:17:57-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:17:57):**  every couple of years, but there's always evacuation warnings here in these valleys  
**[0:18:02-0:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:18:02):**  for the risk of mudslides, landslides.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:18:06):**  Are there some things that you can recommend that can be implemented on a large scale that  
**[0:18:11-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:18:11):**  can help to reduce the risks of regions like this?  
**[0:18:16-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:18:16):**  Well, we're starting to see an increase in landslide tragedies.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:18:25):**  And that's because of our numbers.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:18:29):**  We've got a population that's kind of filled up the good land.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:18:34):**  And now we're starting to move towards steeper and steeper land, which is something that,  
**[0:18:39-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:18:39):**  you know, we considered not suitable for building in the past.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:18:45):**  So we've got more people living in mountainous regions today all around the world than we  
**[0:18:51-0:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:18:51):**  used to.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:18:52):**  And the people just, for the most part, you know, they're always mountain villages, but  
**[0:18:56-0:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:18:56):**  for the most part, they just avoided these areas.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:18:59):**  It's not an option anymore.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:19:02):**  So with respect to earthworks to prevent a landslide, not so much apart from, let's say,  
**[0:19:15-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:19:15):**  terracing for agriculture in limited runs, you know, like keeping it down to about, say,  
**[0:19:24-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:19:24):**  six or so benches per run and then giving yourself a stretch of forest.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:19:30):**  But trees, trees, trees.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:19:35):**  Trees are your friend when it comes to that.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:19:38):**  What about other deep-rooted plants like vetiver grass and to some degree, no, I can only actually  
**[0:19:45-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:19:45):**  think of the ones around here that have indigenous names, but I know there's quite a few erosion  
**[0:19:50-0:19:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:19:50):**  prevention plants.

**[0:19:57-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:19:57):**  Well, I think that's a good example.

**[0:20:38-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:20:38):**  And we had an earthquake, I think two days ago.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:20:41):**  Plus, the rainy season can be pretty heavy.

**[0:21:27-0:21:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:21:27):**  Well I like to be on it in person despite what I said about the guy in Somaliland.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:21:35):**  If I'm going to do an actual, you know, put this here, I like to spend some time.

**[0:21:44-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:21:44):**  I tend to be, you know, analytical and fact-based, but if I can, I like to just do meditative  
**[0:21:51-0:21:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:21:51):**  walking on the site to sort of get a feel for it.

**[0:22:09-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:22:09):**  and think about what can go in it.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:22:12):**  For mapping, Google Earth is a great tool.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:22:16):**  Until the end of last year, the beginning of this year, somewhere around there, it used

**[0:22:29-0:22:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:22:29):**  And because Google gave up SketchUp, and it's a separate company now, you can't do that  
**[0:22:37-0:22:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:22:37):**  anymore and it's a real pity because you used to be able to.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:22:40):**  That's why it hasn't been working for me.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:22:41):**  I didn't realize it was acquired by someone else.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:22:43):**  I was gutted when I couldn't import Maps anymore.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:22:46):**  Yeah, it was kind of, well, Google kind of gave it up.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:22:49):**  They purchased it and then they decided that it was a useful product so they didn't want

**[0:23:01-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:23:01):**  Google Maps.

**[0:23:05-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:23:05):**  You used to be able to.

**[0:23:07-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:23:07):**  I used that all the time.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:23:08):**  I couldn't figure out why it wasn't working anymore.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:23:10):**  At least I got an answer.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:23:11):**  Yeah, you could stretch your dimensions so if you were on landscape, you could sort of  
**[0:23:18-0:23:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:23:18):**  exaggerate the elevation and get a good look at the land.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:23:22):**  If it wasn't, you know, if it wasn't like your region where it's really mountainous,  
**[0:23:25-0:23:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:23:25):**  it's a little bit more rolling here, but you could exaggerate that.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:23:29):**  But you can't do that anymore because you can't import decent maps.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:23:33):**  So you know, observing the site and keeping things on land that's not too steep, getting  
**[0:23:45-0:23:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:23:45):**  a feel for what can go in, getting a feel for where things will be safe.  
**[0:23:53-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:23:53):**  And then realizing, well, I like to map things out with the GPS waypoints.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:24:02):**  And as you know, that gives you not perfect accuracy.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:24:06):**  You're sort of plus or minus.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:24:07):**  You're within a circle of about nine meters or thereabouts.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:24:11):**  So there's a bit of leeway.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:24:13):**  But ultimately, when you get building on a site, it's okay, you pick a point and you  
**[0:24:21-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:24:21):**  build contour lines off that point.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:24:23):**  Like if it's, you know, this is the water height for our dam, you go off that point  
**[0:24:27-0:24:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:24:27):**  and it's somewhat arbitrary.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:24:30):**  But you plan it out, you know, plan it out as best as you can on paper.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:24:34):**  Sure.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:24:35):**  Let's talk about that.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:24:36):**  How do you usually go about mapping contour lines?  
**[0:24:38-0:24:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:24:38):**  I know you said you started using GPS points, but those can be a little inaccurate.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:24:43):**  Do you have different methods for smaller sites and larger ones?  
**[0:24:48-0:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:24:48):**  Or do you pretty much use the same method throughout?  
**[0:24:51-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:24:51):**  Well, I tend to focus on larger sites.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:24:57):**  I used to do a lot of urban stuff through a Toronto group.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:25:03):**  And for the most part, it was designing gardens.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:25:09):**  That gets old really fast.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:25:11):**  Designing gardens for people.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:25:12):**  And mainly designing gardens for people that they never actually implement.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:25:17):**  It's kind of like, why am I doing this?  
**[0:25:19-0:25:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:25:19):**  And I hate going to the city.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:25:20):**  So I'll just build myself as a guy who does, you know, I do earthworks and I help out farms  
**[0:25:27-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:25:27):**  and rural properties.

**[0:25:32-0:25:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:25:32):**  And so very often in this region, like swales are not, everybody who reads about permaculture  
**[0:25:40-0:25:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:25:40):**  thinks, oh, I'm not really doing permaculture until I have swales all over the place.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:25:46):**  And the way it usually works out, about half the people I see, almost half, maybe 40%,  
**[0:25:53-0:25:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:25:53):**  I say, yeah, don't do anything on this site.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:25:58):**  And if nothing else, then they don't spend any unnecessary money.

**[0:26:10-0:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:26:10):**  Why is that?  
**[0:26:12-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:26:12):**  Well, in temperate regions and where you are a tropical region, a wet tropical region,  
**[0:26:21-0:26:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:26:21):**  they're a different beast.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:26:24):**  Certainly in temperate regions where I am, we don't have, we have extremely little runoff.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:26:33):**  And when we do have what looks like runoff, usually it's just in really wet periods, it's  
**[0:26:40-0:26:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:26:40):**  actually through flow, popping out, finding an easier route by popping out over the surface.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:26:46):**  So you could make the argument, yeah, we could put in a swale and catch that through flow.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:26:52):**  But this is usually something that's just an issue during the spring melt.  
**[0:26:55-0:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:26:55):**  And if there's a spring melt and it rains and you're kind of combining, sometimes it's  
**[0:27:02-0:27:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:27:02):**  frost from the winter hanging over and causing water to pop out.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:27:06):**  Sometimes it isn't, but it's something that's not particularly helpful.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:27:13):**  It's burning diesel without much purpose, without a lot of payback.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:27:18):**  Sure.

**[0:27:37-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:27:37):**  Sure, sure.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:27:38):**  Well my favorite maybe is trees, and you plant them.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:27:44):**  I could get into a discussion on that, but let's just sort of run things through for  
**[0:27:49-0:27:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:27:49):**  now.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:27:51):**  Ripping is maybe the next step up from that.  
**[0:27:54-0:28:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:27:54):**  So you've got, you could use a bulldozer, but usually you're pulling a chisel plow that  
**[0:28:00-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:28:00):**  just cuts furrows, maybe inch and a half, two inch wide furrows in the ground.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:28:10):**  Here in Ontario where I am, you just typically you're just going on contour.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:28:15):**  The system developed by an Australian fellow by the name of PA Yeomans has a nice approach,  
**[0:28:22-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:28:22):**  an elegant approach of going slightly off contour from valleys to ridges so that you  
**[0:28:28-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:28:28):**  can gently direct water away from valleys and towards ridges to get more even hydration.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:28:35):**  But basically here we just go on contour and you're creating a little cut in the ground.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:28:42):**  Any runoff comes through and it drops right into that runoff, or right into that furrow,  
**[0:28:50-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:28:50):**  sorry, and is then, you know, has a better chance of infiltrating.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:28:56):**  Now I'd mentioned we don't have as much runoff here, but what they also do is they help to  
**[0:29:00-0:29:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:29:00):**  loosen up the soil and aerate the soil.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:29:04):**  And around here when you're, well, finding them is an issue.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:29:08):**  Finding somebody who's got one you can borrow is extremely hard, but when you talk to like  
**[0:29:12-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:29:12):**  the guys in the farm supply store, they'll just go, oh yeah, subsoilers, those are great.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:29:18):**  And they do so much good for pastures and they'll just go on for 10 minutes raving about  
**[0:29:24-0:29:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:29:24):**  the things.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:29:25):**  And they'll say, yeah, I don't know anybody who has one.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:29:28):**  So it's like this fantastic tool that they know is out there that's really great, but  
**[0:29:34-0:29:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:29:34):**  we don't use it because reasons.

**[0:29:43-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:29:43):**  climate despite what I say about runoff.

**[0:29:57-0:29:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:29:57):**  it does great for the pasture.

**[0:32:50-0:32:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:32:50):**  The next next beastie we've got is a pond.

**[0:33:06-0:33:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:33:06):**  you've cut into the water table and now it's full of water.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:33:09):**  And that's it.

**[0:33:25-0:33:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:33:25):**  It needs something to hold the water in it.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:33:28):**  So the water isn't already there waiting to show up.

**[0:33:47-0:33:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:33:47):**  A dam is something that has one or more engineered walls.

**[0:33:58-0:34:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:33:58):**  And that is a dam.

**[0:34:38-0:34:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:34:38):**  I don't recommend anybody go over an intermittent stream.

**[0:34:53-0:34:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:34:53):**  In some parts of the world, or some jurisdictions really, it's not a choice.

**[0:36:07-0:36:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:36:07):**  of land if you're going through the contours of the entire landscape.

**[0:36:15-0:36:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:36:15):**  either by machinery or by hand, and maybe give a few options for people on different

**[0:36:35-0:36:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:36:35):**  I can talk a bit about laying out contour.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:36:38):**  Yeah, go ahead.

**[0:36:46-0:36:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:36:46):**  and a water level, or as the Aussies say, a bunyip level.  
**[0:36:53-0:37:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:36:53):**  I bring both of those to courses with the intent of teaching my students how much they

**[0:37:57-0:38:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:37:57):**  Yeah, certainly around here we have so many rocks in the landscape.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:38:01):**  Yeah, it's like taking contour on a crumpet.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:38:06):**  There's bumps, there's holes, and your foot is always going to land.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:38:10):**  The foot of the A-frame is always going to land on one of those.

**[0:38:31-0:38:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:38:31):**  I'll just put it over here.

**[0:39:46-0:39:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:39:46):**  people, that's much, much faster than both the A-frame and the water level.  
**[0:39:53-0:40:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:39:53):**  But you can do it in a quarter of the time of a dumpy level if you're using a laser level.

**[0:40:07-0:40:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:40:07):**  So nice.

**[0:40:23-0:40:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:40:23):**  People tend to underestimate before they get started, unless they've done a lot of digging,

**[0:40:41-0:40:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:40:41):**  swales.

**[0:40:46-0:40:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:40:46):**  And really what I went there to do, well, I say you could put a swale across here, but  
**[0:40:52-0:40:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:40:52):**  what I went there to do was to map their site for them.  
**[0:40:57-0:40:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:40:57):**  And they decided to put in a swale.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:40:59):**  And this couple were amazing go-getters.  
**[0:41:03-0:41:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:41:03):**  I mean, they had a site that was more advanced.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:41:07):**  They'd moved there from Wales.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:41:09):**  And after 18 months, they'd done more on their site than most people get done in five to  
**[0:41:16-0:41:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:41:16):**  10 years.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:41:17):**  They were just amazing.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:41:19):**  But the next thing I know, they're out there with shovels digging a swale.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:41:23):**  And I'll be damned if they didn't dig a swale across, I don't know how many meters, like  
**[0:41:30-0:41:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:41:30):**  300 meters or so of property.  
**[0:41:34-0:41:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:41:34):**  Just amazing.

**[0:41:39-0:41:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:41:39):**  I've done a lot of digging myself too, and a lot of different types of soil.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:41:43):**  But it was mostly in the context of installing trails in national parks.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:41:49):**  So I definitely get how much work that is.  
**[0:41:51-0:41:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:41:51):**  I mean, we can't get machinery on most of the sites where I do natural buildings and  
**[0:41:56-0:41:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:41:56):**  permaculture designs.  
**[0:41:58-0:42:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:41:58):**  So we often have local crews digging them.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:42:01):**  But man, like, you know, it's not only time consuming, it's a large expense to have a  
**[0:42:07-0:42:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:42:07):**  team doing that full time.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:42:09):**  And then obviously with all of the stones that are in our soil here too, people underestimate  
**[0:42:15-0:42:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:42:15):**  that.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:42:16):**  They're like, oh, they'll just be able to, you know, cut through this loamy dirt.  
**[0:42:18-0:42:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:42:18):**  I'm like, yeah, there's boulders in all of this.  
**[0:42:21-0:42:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:42:21):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:22-0:42:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:42:22):**  We've literally had people with like hammers and chisels getting stones out of there.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:42:26):**  So yeah, I have a lot of respect for people who can manage to take on the initiative of  
**[0:42:32-0:42:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:42:32):**  digging in a large feature like that.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:42:34):**  Yeah, definitely.  
**[0:42:35-0:42:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:42:35):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:36-0:42:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:42:36):**  But for the rest of people, what would you recommend?  
**[0:42:41-0:42:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:42:41):**  Well, a nice trick if you are cutting in something linear across the landscape, like a swale,  
**[0:42:53-0:42:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:42:53):**  is to use a bulldozer.  
**[0:42:55-0:43:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:42:55):**  Well, what they call a six way or one with a pat blade, a power angle tilt blade.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:43:02):**  And that is a blade that you can, the operator can tilt on an angle and then just cut in  
**[0:43:09-0:43:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:43:09):**  one corner of the blade and then cast the dirt on the downhill side.  
**[0:43:16-0:43:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:43:16):**  So it's a very, very rapid way of cutting in swales.  
**[0:43:20-0:43:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:43:20):**  Just go across the landscape and cut them through.  
**[0:43:26-0:43:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:43:26):**  Excavators do a pretty good job as well.  
**[0:43:28-0:43:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:43:28):**  They're fairly quick.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:43:29):**  They're not as fast.  
**[0:43:31-0:43:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:43:31):**  Nothing is really as fast as a bulldozer.  
**[0:43:34-0:43:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:43:34):**  And you do have to think about, you know, your scale of things.  
**[0:43:40-0:43:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:43:40):**  How big it's going to be.  
**[0:43:41-0:43:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:43:41):**  I think I would be tempted up to a certain size to just make multiple passes with a bulldozer  
**[0:43:47-0:43:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:43:47):**  if I had to over using an excavator.  
**[0:43:53-0:43:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:43:53):**  But you do have to cost things out, like how much is dozer delivery and do you have access  
**[0:43:58-0:43:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:43:58):**  to it.  
**[0:43:59-0:44:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:43:59):**  So you can go to excavators or backhoes.  
**[0:44:04-0:44:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:44:04):**  Most places, most places around the world, you can have somebody who's got a backhoe  
**[0:44:09-0:44:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:44:09):**  and they can get in there and dig away at things if it's not too dangerous of terrain.  
**[0:44:17-0:44:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:44:17):**  Sure.  
**[0:44:18-0:44:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:44:18):**  But the important thing to know is that ideally these are one time expenses.  
**[0:44:22-0:44:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:44:22):**  If they're done correctly, you don't ever have to go back in and reinstall earthworks.  
**[0:44:27-0:44:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:44:27):**  They tend to just be installed at the beginning of a design implementation and barring some  
**[0:44:33-0:44:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:44:33):**  sort of catastrophe or some who knows what.  
**[0:44:37-0:44:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:44:37):**  It should just be a one time expense, correct?  
**[0:44:40-0:44:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:44:40):**  Yes.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:44:41):**  Yes.

**[0:46:41-0:46:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:46:41):**  overall there, you know, their impact in the greater system is to make water more available.  
**[0:46:48-0:46:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:46:48):**  I'd scoped out a site about this time last year for a dam and it was a very dry year  
**[0:46:57-0:47:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:46:57):**  last year and we were out on the site and the ground was really hard and the farmer  
**[0:47:05-0:47:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:47:05):**  who was there, he said, yeah, since the end of July, this was October, we were there,  
**[0:47:11-0:47:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:47:11):**  you know, we hadn't had, we had less than an inch of rain, he said.  
**[0:47:17-0:47:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:47:17):**  So it was really dry, but he said, you know, they didn't quite know what was going on,  
**[0:47:21-0:47:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:47:21):**  how dams worked or things like that.  
**[0:47:23-0:47:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:47:23):**  He said, maybe you can tap off of the spring here.  
**[0:47:26-0:47:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:47:26):**  So he took me into this forested section on the hillside and we stepped in and within  
**[0:47:34-0:47:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:47:34):**  about three paces into it, the ground started getting mushy and sure enough, there was a,  
**[0:47:40-0:47:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:47:40):**  they had a spring box there and everything and the water, the ground was wet and the  
**[0:47:44-0:47:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:47:44):**  water was flowing in the spring, in the well itself and all that was because of the trees.  
**[0:47:52-0:47:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:47:52):**  It wasn't the magic of that location, it was just the trees doing that.  
**[0:47:57-0:47:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:47:57):**  That's remarkable.  
**[0:47:58-0:48:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:47:58):**  Now, here, let's switch gears just a little bit.  
**[0:48:01-0:48:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:48:01):**  I know there's a big difference between storing water in the soil and storing it in containments.  
**[0:48:06-0:48:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:48:06):**  So like either ponds, cisterns or dams.  
**[0:48:09-0:48:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:48:09):**  Now, how do you work with a combination of storage systems in order to maximize the irrigation  
**[0:48:14-0:48:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:48:14):**  potential on a site and how can they all be connected?  
**[0:48:19-0:48:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:48:19):**  Well, maybe a good example is a feature I put in on an organic farm not too far from  
**[0:48:32-0:48:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:48:32):**  me and he'd wanted a reservoir to store water and I, you know, my idea was let's catch as  
**[0:48:43-0:48:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:48:43):**  much as we can off of his site and we can store it in this dam.  
**[0:48:48-0:48:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:48:48):**  So the site was kind of a dream site.  
**[0:48:52-0:49:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:48:52):**  It was just about as high in the landscape as we could get and the house there had some  
**[0:49:00-0:49:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:49:00):**  hard surfaces, the greenhouse, the barn had more hard surfaces to catch rain and pretty  
**[0:49:06-0:49:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:49:06):**  heavy clay on site.  
**[0:49:09-0:49:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:49:09):**  Kind of interesting mixed soil but mostly clay soil.  
**[0:49:14-0:49:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:49:14):**  A fair bit more potential for runoff on that site and also the idea of catching the spring  
**[0:49:22-0:49:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:49:22):**  melt off of there.  
**[0:49:25-0:49:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:49:25):**  So what I did was ring the site.  
**[0:49:30-0:49:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:49:30):**  It wound up being sort of U-shaped but a big swale around the top of the site which fed  
**[0:49:38-0:49:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:49:38):**  into a dam there built near their house and that would allow water to be captured by the  
**[0:49:49-0:49:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:49:49):**  swale and then dump into the dam itself and at the same time the swales serve as a spillway  
**[0:49:57-0:49:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:49:57):**  for the dam.  
**[0:49:58-0:50:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:49:58):**  So there is safety if the water level gets too high.  
**[0:50:01-0:50:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:50:01):**  What happens is it backfills across the landscape into the swales and with the length of the  
**[0:50:10-0:50:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:50:10):**  swales and the size of them that has the potential of adding about close to a quarter million  
**[0:50:19-0:50:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:50:19):**  liters more than just the dam itself.  
**[0:50:24-0:50:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:50:24):**  So it can hold a lot and then if it's doing that, if it is full to that point that it's  
**[0:50:30-0:50:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:50:30):**  backed up across the landscape, the swales are not compacted so they allow water to sink  
**[0:50:37-0:50:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:50:37):**  into the ground so now you're rehydrating the top of the landscape.  
**[0:50:42-0:50:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:50:42):**  There's a certain amount of that that happens through the dam and it's not well studied  
**[0:50:48-0:50:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:50:48):**  like how much water infiltrates into the soil from a dam.  
**[0:50:53-0:50:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:50:53):**  There's some but kind of the point of a dam is to have that minimalized so that it holds  
**[0:50:58-0:50:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:50:58):**  water.  
**[0:50:59-0:51:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:50:59):**  So a dam itself is not really, is certainly not ideal as something for getting water to  
**[0:51:06-0:51:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:51:06):**  infiltrate into the soil but the swales add to that.  
**[0:51:14-0:51:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:51:14):**  And I really like the idea of using swales as spillways.  
**[0:51:19-0:51:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:51:19):**  So you can build a good secure channel that goes to a spillway and then beyond that channel  
**[0:51:27-0:51:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:51:27):**  have swales.

**[0:51:35-0:51:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:51:35):**  They can be compacted.

**[0:53:59-0:54:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:53:59):**  You've got your water, you've got your, well if you've got open water systems, I like to,

**[0:59:04-0:59:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:59:04):**  It's been, you know, just so much effort breaking it.  
**[0:59:07-0:59:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:59:07):**  We haven't been trying to break it, but you know, we've broken it.

**[0:59:44-0:59:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=0:59:44):**  Once those small adjustments, you know, sometimes large if you're talking about machinery and

**[1:00:26-1:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:00:26):**  We put in some swales on a section of hillside that the farmer who let us work on the land  
**[1:00:33-1:00:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:00:33):**  kind of considered that section to be a write-off and said, you know, carte blanche.  
**[1:00:38-1:00:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:00:38):**  Well he didn't say carte blanche because he was speaking in Telugu, but whatever carte  
**[1:00:42-1:00:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:00:42):**  blanche is in Telugu.

**[1:00:50-1:00:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:00:50):**  interpreting, he said, you know, I got really worried.  
**[1:00:54-1:00:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:00:54):**  I saw you digging up my feeling.  
**[1:00:56-1:01:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:00:56):**  Oh God, what if I said yes to?  
**[1:01:00-1:01:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:01:00):**  And he couldn't talk to me, right?  
**[1:01:01-1:01:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:01:01):**  So he just had to watch and observe.  
**[1:01:04-1:01:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:01:04):**  And then I caught on.  
**[1:01:05-1:01:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:01:05):**  I saw what you were doing.

**[1:01:13-1:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:01:13):**  there at 2 a.m. on his motorbike and ran across, you know, down off the road across this field  
**[1:01:20-1:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:01:20):**  and then up the hill and then just shone his flashlight into the swale.  
**[1:01:26-1:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:01:26):**  And all that water that would have washed off and been gone forever, now it's caught

**[1:01:38-1:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:01:38):**  hill when it's rainy, you're going to start to see springs coming out.  
**[1:01:44-1:01:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:01:44):**  And I joke about, yeah, that was a safe bet because three to five years they're going  
**[1:01:49-1:01:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:01:49):**  to forget what I said and I won't be around anyway.  
**[1:01:54-1:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:01:54):**  But I'll be damned if the, you know, the rains didn't come.  
**[1:01:57-1:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:01:57):**  And I'd taken pictures of everything, but I didn't.  
**[1:02:01-1:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:02:01):**  I'm kicking myself now, but I didn't take a picture of this well that they dug with  
**[1:02:07-1:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:02:07):**  an excavator sort of at the bottom and off to the side of where the swales were in.  
**[1:02:15-1:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:02:15):**  And it was a three meter drop down to the water level in there.  
**[1:02:19-1:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:02:19):**  And they sent a photo in, you know, five months later and they're standing, they're crouching  
**[1:02:27-1:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:02:27):**  next to it and splashing water off of, you know, the water level is like 30 centimeters  
**[1:02:33-1:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:02:33):**  down from ground level.

**[1:02:39-1:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:02:39):**  And then they, everywhere in the region, they establish mango trees with irrigation and  
**[1:02:47-1:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:02:47):**  including on flat ground.  
**[1:02:49-1:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:02:49):**  And they didn't here.

**[1:02:52-1:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:02:52):**  They were maybe about 60 centimeters tall or so, planted them and left them.  
**[1:02:59-1:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:02:59):**  Now they have been slow growing.  
**[1:03:01-1:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:03:01):**  They would have benefited from some irrigation, but they have survived on their own.  
**[1:03:09-1:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:03:09):**  And they're, you know, they're, last time I saw a couple years ago, they were maybe  
**[1:03:15-1:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:03:15):**  two meters high thereabouts.

**[1:04:43-1:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:04:43):**  So I've got design fundamentals one and two, which people seem to think are worth their  
**[1:04:50-1:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:04:50):**  time, mostly.

**[1:04:54-1:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:04:54):**  And it's sort of my thoughts on design and what's important with the overall design process.  
**[1:05:02-1:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:05:02):**  Even if you're not doing permaculture, you're just doing something that needs planning and  
**[1:05:06-1:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:05:06):**  designing, then I think it might also be helpful as well.  
**[1:05:10-1:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:05:10):**  Certainly.  
**[1:05:11-1:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:05:11):**  A lot of the considerations that you would do for permaculture design apply to just about

**[1:05:22-1:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:05:22):**  just to name a few.  
**[1:05:23-1:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:05:23):**  I use them a lot in building, in my case, but also in a lot of the other projects that

**[1:05:34-1:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:05:34):**  The Permaculture Earthworks Handbook is something that I've already referenced quite a few times  
**[1:05:38-1:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:05:38):**  while doing assessments for clients.  
**[1:05:41-1:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:05:41):**  And like you talked about, the resources that you have on your blog, and also the way it  
**[1:05:46-1:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:05:46):**  goes into detail about scaling and doing the calculations for many of these things, were  
**[1:05:52-1:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:05:52):**  resources that I had never come across before.  
**[1:05:55-1:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:05:55):**  And I know that Earthworks can be sort of a tricky thing.  
**[1:05:59-1:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:05:59):**  And again, because it can be also a very large initial expense, and potentially something  
**[1:06:04-1:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:06:04):**  that you only ever do once, it's definitely worth getting it right the first time and

**[1:06:15-1:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:06:15):**  safe overall.  
**[1:06:17-1:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:06:17):**  So I would really recommend anyone listening to this to check out both the book, the blogs,

**[1:07:47-1:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:07:47):**  months.  
**[1:07:48-1:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:07:48):**  I'm joined here now with my good friend and founder of Atitlán Organics, Shad Goodsy.  
**[1:07:52-1:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:07:52):**  Hey buddy, what's new?  
**[1:07:54-1:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:07:54):**  Oh man, so much is happening.  
**[1:07:56-1:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:07:56):**  First off though, I just want to say thanks for having me, man.  
**[1:07:59-1:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:07:59):**  I really love your podcast and I actually had a great time doing that interview back  
**[1:08:03-1:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:08:03):**  in one of the earlier episodes.  
**[1:08:05-1:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:08:05):**  Anyway, probably what's most exciting is our new collaboration between Atitlán Organics  
**[1:08:10-1:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:08:10):**  and Abundant Edge.

**[1:08:16-1:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:08:16):**  they really have become a staple here in Lake Atitlán.  
**[1:08:20-1:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:08:20):**  In particular though, the Intro to Permaculture course is just an amazing way for travelers,  
**[1:08:25-1:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:08:25):**  gardeners, architects, basically anyone to fully immerse themselves in this new paradigm  
**[1:08:31-1:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:08:31):**  of permaculture design.  
**[1:08:32-1:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:08:32):**  Like honestly, you can't take this course and still see the world the same way afterward.  
**[1:08:38-1:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:08:38):**  It's life changing.

**[1:08:45-1:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:08:45):**  we're going to be able to offer your natural building course immediately after every one  
**[1:08:50-1:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:08:50):**  of our Intro to Permaculture courses.  
**[1:08:52-1:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:08:52):**  Literally, this two week offering is like possibly the most complete package that I  
**[1:08:58-1:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:08:58):**  know of available anywhere.

**[1:09:05-1:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:09:05):**  they need to start their own regenerative project or just their own regenerative lifestyle.  
**[1:09:11-1:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:09:11):**  That's what I'm excited about, man.  
**[1:09:12-1:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:09:12):**  But yeah, what about you?  
**[1:09:14-1:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:09:14):**  What's going on?  
**[1:09:15-1:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:09:15):**  Man, well, you know already that me and the Abundant Edge team are gearing up for a big  
**[1:09:19-1:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:09:19):**  season as well.  
**[1:09:20-1:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:09:20):**  I mean, starting in November, we'll be breaking ground on a regenerative farming demonstration  
**[1:09:25-1:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/permaculture-earthworks-demystified-with-douglas-barnes-author-of-the-permaculture-earthworks-handbook-048/#t=1:09:25):**  site, which is of course right down the hill from your farm.

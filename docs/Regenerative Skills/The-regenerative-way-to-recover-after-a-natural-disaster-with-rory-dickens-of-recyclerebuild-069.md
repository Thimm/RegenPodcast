**[0:00:00-0:00:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:03-0:00:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:00:03):**  Here we dive deep into the worlds of permaculture, natural building, and regenerative living  
**[0:00:07-0:00:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:00:07):**  as we aspire to help you reach your highest potential for yourself, for your community,  
**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:00:12):**  and for this beautiful planet that we all share.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:00:14):**  As always, I'm your host Oliver Gaucher, and I have a great session for you in this week's  
**[0:00:18-0:00:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:00:18):**  episode, so let's jump right in!  
**[0:00:30-0:00:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:00:30):**  Are you looking for the best resources to help you build a regenerative lifestyle?  
**[0:00:34-0:00:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:00:34):**  New Society Publishers has been a leader in sustainable publishing for over 30 years.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:00:39):**  They publish good news and solutions for individuals and organizations seeking to change their  
**[0:00:43-0:00:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:00:43):**  lives so that they may change the world for the better.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:00:47):**  Their company mandate goes far beyond the single bottom line of profit.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:00:50):**  They care deeply not only about what they publish, but also how they do business.  
**[0:00:55-0:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:00:55):**  They believe in the authors that they take on and the works that they bring to the marketplace.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:00:59):**  From sustainable living to progressive parenting, New Society Publishers has the books you need  
**[0:01:04-0:01:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:01:04):**  to help build a better world.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:01:06):**  Buy your print and ebooks online at www.newsociety.com or at fine bookstores near you.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:01:14):**  Climate change can manifest in many ways, but in the last 10 years the growing trend  
**[0:01:18-0:01:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:01:18):**  of increasingly severe storm seasons and natural disasters have grabbed headlines and displaced  
**[0:01:24-0:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:01:24):**  entire populations.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:01:26):**  The urgency of disaster relief is growing every year and the cost of the recovery efforts  
**[0:01:31-0:01:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:01:31):**  is skyrocketing.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:01:33):**  This is what led me to speak with Rory Dickens.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:01:35):**  I was first introduced to Rory through John Bodnar, a former student of mine from our  
**[0:01:40-0:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:01:40):**  Intro to Natural Building course who recommended that I get in touch with Rory to talk to him  
**[0:01:44-0:01:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:01:44):**  about the inspiring disaster relief projects that he and his team are working on with Recycle  
**[0:01:49-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:01:49):**  Rebuild on the island of Dominica in the Caribbean.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:01:52):**  In this interview, we talk in detail about some of the major issues facing modern disaster  
**[0:01:57-0:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:01:57):**  relief efforts and how they can be improved.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:02:00):**  Rory speaks about his own experiences working in many relief efforts around the world and  
**[0:02:05-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:02:05):**  what he's learned as well as how Recycle Rebuild approaches their recovery efforts  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:02:09):**  from a local perspective that takes into account the specific needs of the affected communities  
**[0:02:14-0:02:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:02:14):**  and the resources that they have on hand.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:02:17):**  There are a lot of nuances in each of these cases and it was refreshing to hear a viewpoint  
**[0:02:21-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:02:21):**  that doesn't advocate for a one size fits all approach.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:02:25):**  So I hope you get as much out of this interview as I did.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:02:27):**  Now I'll turn things over to Rory.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:02:29):**  Hey Rory, thank you so much for taking the time to be with us today.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:02:32):**  How are you doing?  
**[0:02:33-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:02:33):**  I'm good thank you.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:02:34):**  Pleasure to be on your show.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:02:36):**  Hey, it's my pleasure.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:02:37):**  Now we're going to get to talking about some of the intricacies of the disaster relief  
**[0:02:42-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:02:42):**  industry and response and some of your original takes and sort of differences from the conventional  
**[0:02:49-0:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:02:49):**  way of going about things that have set your organization apart.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:02:52):**  And I've got a ton of questions.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:02:54):**  So what do you say we just jump right in?  
**[0:02:55-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:02:55):**  Sounds good.  
**[0:02:56-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:02:56):**  Let's go.  
**[0:02:57-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:02:57):**  All right.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:02:58):**  So if you could get us started with a little bit about your background and what gave you  
**[0:03:02-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:03:02):**  the idea to start working in disaster relief settings.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:03:06):**  So I went to university in Scotland and I studied architecture.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:03:13):**  And for the whole time, seven years of my education, I kept on feeling like there was  
**[0:03:17-0:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:03:17):**  something else.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:03:18):**  There was always more to architecture than what I was being taught.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:03:23):**  And so I started originally actually working in kind of sustainable architecture in Asia.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:03:29):**  And I was working with impoverished communities to see how architecture could provide a solution  
**[0:03:35-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:03:35):**  to a lot of the problems that were going on in their traditional cultures.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:03:41):**  And eventually, being so close to the Philippines, Hurricane Yolanda hit the Philippines and  
**[0:03:48-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:03:48):**  slowly I got pulled into it as a kind of as a line of work.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:03:54):**  Originally I started as a volunteer.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:03:56):**  I was just drawn to doing something using my architectural background, but in a different  
**[0:04:02-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:04:02):**  sense.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:04:03):**  So I started building schools in the Philippines.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:04:07):**  But when it really kind of became my career was when I actually took a break and I decided  
**[0:04:13-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:04:13):**  I wanted to take a break from humanitarian work.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:04:15):**  And I went to Ecuador to continue my sustainable kind of architectural practice to build some  
**[0:04:23-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:04:23):**  bamboo houses.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:04:25):**  And by sheer coincidence, I was involved in the very middle of an earthquake.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:04:32):**  And that earthquake, you know, suddenly my whole career I've been thinking about how  
**[0:04:40-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:04:40):**  did it feel to be there on day one.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:04:44):**  You know, people were telling me their stories and for the first time ever, I was now there  
**[0:04:47-0:04:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:04:47):**  on day one telling the same story that everyone else had, you know, that I had heard before.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:04:54):**  And I saw the loss of life and I saw the impact and the reason why we're there.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:04:59):**  And you know, that kind of really brought architecture home because for the first time  
**[0:05:04-0:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:05:04):**  I was designing buildings in a disaster response context that was about, you know, how I would  
**[0:05:10-0:05:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:05:10):**  feel in that building as well.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:05:12):**  Because you know, it doesn't matter what disaster you have, architecture always kind of plays  
**[0:05:17-0:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:05:17):**  a role.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:05:19):**  And yeah, and whether it is, you know, a hurricane or an earthquake, you know, you seek shelter  
**[0:05:28-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:05:28):**  in your house.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:05:29):**  And if that house is, you know, not up to the challenge, you know, that's a scary place  
**[0:05:34-0:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:05:34):**  to be.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:05:35):**  And that's how I ended up, you know, continuing to do that for two, three years.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:05:40):**  That's remarkable.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:05:41):**  You and I actually have quite a lot of comment in our backgrounds.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:05:44):**  I've also worked in the Philippines, including doing some designs for sort of disaster resistant  
**[0:05:51-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:05:51):**  homes, mostly in the context of flooding.  
**[0:05:54-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:05:54):**  I've also worked in Ecuador and I've been around a lot of relief efforts, kind of between  
**[0:06:01-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:06:01):**  transitions in different places.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:06:02):**  In fact, right now we have a relief effort going on in the wake of Volcán Fuego, which  
**[0:06:08-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:06:08):**  is actually visible from my house.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:06:11):**  We actually saw the eruption and there's quite a big effort salvaging the remains of those  
**[0:06:17-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:06:17):**  communities that were inundated.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:06:20):**  But yeah, I mean, I can speak from from experience, too, of being in a lot of different places  
**[0:06:25-0:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:06:25):**  where the requirements of buildings and structures and infrastructure, for that matter, is absolutely  
**[0:06:32-0:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:06:32):**  different based on the risks and the possibilities of geological or heavy weather events that  
**[0:06:38-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:06:38):**  could destabilize those types of regions.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:06:41):**  Yeah.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:06:42):**  So now tell me about some of the issues facing most disaster relief efforts and areas with  
**[0:06:47-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:06:47):**  room for major improvement.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:06:49):**  What inspired you to come in and hopefully do things a little better?  
**[0:06:53-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:06:53):**  Cool.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:06:54):**  So I know this is probably my eighth disaster zone.  
**[0:06:57-0:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:06:57):**  So Dominica.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:06:59):**  And you know, you actually start going to these places and you start seeing very similar  
**[0:07:04-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:07:04):**  patterns.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:07:05):**  So, you know, of course, some are earthquakes, some are, you know, hurricanes, etc.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:07:10):**  But you know, every it's kind of the way that humanity and work often feels wasteful.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:07:18):**  And it's a strange thing to say, because, you know, when we talk about charity, a lot  
**[0:07:23-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:07:23):**  of the one of the one of the main kind of things that mainly donors talk about is how  
**[0:07:27-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:07:27):**  much my money gets to the front line, how much my money goes to the people who really  
**[0:07:32-0:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:07:32):**  need it.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:07:34):**  And a lot of charities can often say, well, actually, you know, maybe it's 95% after overhead.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:07:40):**  But you know, thinking about what does that really mean?  
**[0:07:43-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:07:43):**  You know, 95%.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:07:45):**  So if we break it down and imagine architecture, one of the one of the most key points I think  
**[0:07:51-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:07:51):**  about is where is the material coming from?  
**[0:07:54-0:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:07:54):**  Because if the material is coming from in Dominica, as a classic example abroad, maybe  
**[0:07:59-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:07:59):**  from the States, maybe from China, maybe from South America, if that material is coming  
**[0:08:07-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:08:07):**  from there, that means your money, the donation money isn't necessarily going directly to  
**[0:08:12-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:08:12):**  the community that needs it most, and is actually going to these large countries that are probably  
**[0:08:17-0:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:08:17):**  nowhere near the disaster.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:08:20):**  And that means, you know, sometimes I start thinking, okay, well, 95% of the money goes  
**[0:08:23-0:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:08:23):**  to the person in terms of they get a material or a house.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:08:28):**  But what if the money was actually invested in the community?  
**[0:08:32-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:08:32):**  You know, what if when a hurricane goes through and flattens all of the trees, a nonprofit  
**[0:08:38-0:08:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:08:38):**  comes in and sets up a logging, you know, logging space or a sawmill, and then from  
**[0:08:46-0:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:08:46):**  that potential waste, you know, provides employment that then later fuels the rebuild of the country.  
**[0:08:54-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:08:54):**  And I think that for me, that's one of the major kind of major problems in disaster response.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:09:00):**  And you can see that in the Philippines, you can see that in Nepal, in Ecuador, you could  
**[0:09:06-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:09:06):**  also see that less so because it's not a land, it's a land, it's got, it's a part of a major  
**[0:09:13-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:09:13):**  continent.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:09:14):**  But when you get down to the islands, and it's particularly the Caribbean, every country  
**[0:09:20-0:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:09:20):**  is outsourcing everything.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:09:22):**  And Dominica is in a kind of a crisis where they, everything that is to do with the response  
**[0:09:28-0:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:09:28):**  comes on a boat.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:09:30):**  But Dominica was never set up to run this way, so they have a port.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:09:36):**  Now the port is not what you would imagine as, you know, huge cranes lifting shipping  
**[0:09:41-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:09:41):**  containers off, and they've got large vast space for all the shipping containers.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:09:47):**  There's probably, you know, 100 shipping containers crammed into this tiny little space, and three  
**[0:09:53-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:09:53):**  guys are, you know, a few dozen people are managing it.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:09:56):**  And that creates, you know, problems, and everything gets blocked to the port.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:10:02):**  So when humanitarian agencies suddenly need all of this lumber, and all of these screws,  
**[0:10:08-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:10:08):**  and all of these materials to build houses, they're actually preventing other businesses  
**[0:10:13-0:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:10:13):**  from getting what they need too.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:10:16):**  And that's kind of a, you know, this was a very eye-opening thing for me, especially  
**[0:10:21-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:10:21):**  in Dominica, to understand this major problem of importation of goods.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:10:26):**  Certainly, yeah, the response to a lot of these types of events is, you know, increasingly  
**[0:10:33-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:10:33):**  well coordinated and with better focus each time, but traditionally has often gone to  
**[0:10:38-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:10:38):**  support the same sort of industrial and outsourced businesses and even governmental models that,  
**[0:10:47-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:10:47):**  you know, are quite disconnected from the communities.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:10:49):**  And it's one of the reasons why I was drawn to your efforts and wanted to do this interview,  
**[0:10:53-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:10:53):**  because you had a different approach in that area.  
**[0:10:55-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:10:55):**  Now, how is your organization's approach different from these governmental or even non-governmental  
**[0:11:01-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:11:01):**  organizations that go in after disaster responses for rebuilding?  
**[0:11:06-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:11:06):**  Sure.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:11:07):**  So, Resugger Rebuild was set up to kind of solve this logistical problem and work with  
**[0:11:12-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:11:12):**  nonprofits, you know, providing them with cheaper and more sustainable sources of materials  
**[0:11:20-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:11:20):**  that benefited the communities as a whole and looked at more kind of long-term development.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:11:25):**  So the original kind of idea came down to the very, very simplest thing was, you know,  
**[0:11:31-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:11:31):**  what is abundant after a natural disaster?  
**[0:11:35-0:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:11:35):**  You know, what is the first thing aid agencies do?  
**[0:11:39-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:11:39):**  And that is ship in food and water.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:11:43):**  And you know, immediately after Hurricane Maria, you know, large agencies, UNICEF, UNN,  
**[0:11:50-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:11:50):**  all came in and they provided thousands and thousands of bottles of water, plastic bottles.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:11:58):**  And you know, communities take this and you see this in Ecuador as well.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:12:02):**  And then at the end, because the country is so damaged, the waste disposal system doesn't  
**[0:12:07-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:12:07):**  exist anymore.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:12:09):**  They end up getting burnt.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:12:11):**  It risks the further spread of disease.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:12:16):**  And you know, there's no solution.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:12:17):**  Well, there wasn't.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:12:19):**  And then later on, you see all of the emergency tents coming in and they've got a six-month  
**[0:12:25-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:12:25):**  lifespan and then we transition to, you know, longer-term shelters.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:12:31):**  And all that plastic and all that waste and all those temporary shelters are still lying  
**[0:12:35-0:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:12:35):**  around in the landscape.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:12:36):**  The tarpaulins getting torn, the bottles are piling up in landfill or on the side of the  
**[0:12:42-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:12:42):**  streets and the nonprofits and agencies are turning internationally again to bring in  
**[0:12:48-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:12:48):**  more supplies because they can't source what they want at an affordable price in the disaster  
**[0:12:54-0:12:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:12:54):**  zone.  
**[0:12:55-0:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:12:55):**  And where Recycler Rebuild wanted to change that model was that we started thinking, what  
**[0:13:01-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:13:01):**  if, you know, those materials, that plastic, that waste was actually an opportunity?  
**[0:13:08-0:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:13:08):**  And so we started looking at how we could convert that plastic, those plastic products  
**[0:13:13-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:13:13):**  and plastic items into products that could be used in the rebuilding effort.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:13:18):**  And you know, you can start simple if everyone is building houses.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:13:23):**  The one thing that, you know, every house needs is a doorknob.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:13:29):**  And the doorknob is one of the easiest things to create.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:13:32):**  And what we do is we then scavenge and salvage all of that plastic, shred it down and then  
**[0:13:39-0:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:13:39):**  heat up in a kind of controlled system for all parts bought off e-bed.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:13:47):**  And you know, source locally and then inject it to create a doorknob.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:13:50):**  And there you have something that is cheaper, is locally made.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:13:56):**  All of the profits or the value of it is gone to the community and at the same time is done  
**[0:14:01-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:14:01):**  a service to the landscape and prevented plastic pollution.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:14:05):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:14:06):**  That's really inspiring.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:14:07):**  Now, I would love to know a little bit about what the training process looks like.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:14:11):**  How do you go about finding people who are interested and available to do the work and  
**[0:14:17-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:14:17):**  get trained up on the machinery and the techniques required to make new building materials out  
**[0:14:22-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:14:22):**  of recycled goods?  
**[0:14:24-0:14:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:14:24):**  So you know, everything that Recycling Rebuild does is actually based on a community.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:14:31):**  It's based on an idea developed by a guy called David Hackins.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:14:35):**  And David Hackins started this community kind of open source project called Precious Plastics.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:14:41):**  And the great thing about Precious Plastics is that all that information is shared and  
**[0:14:45-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:14:45):**  we're not really alone.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:14:47):**  What Recycling Rebuild is bringing to the table is that we found a problem in the kind  
**[0:14:51-0:14:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:14:51):**  of humanitarian world and the disaster response.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:14:54):**  But we've taken a solution that's actually being implemented in all different kind of  
**[0:14:57-0:15:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:14:57):**  walks of life.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:15:00):**  And we've just kind of retrofitted it and seen what needs to be made for a nonprofit.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:15:07):**  So when it comes down to machines, the machines are all very, very simple.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:15:11):**  So when it comes to working with local welders and fabricators, the drawing's all there and  
**[0:15:20-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:15:20):**  ready and we basically go in and we work with them and we slowly explain what we need from  
**[0:15:26-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:15:26):**  them.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:15:27):**  But the great thing is there are also videos online that demonstrate the working product.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:15:33):**  So immediately they get the idea of where the end goal is.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:15:37):**  And I think that's a very important thing when you talk to community members, seeing  
**[0:15:41-0:15:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:15:41):**  the end goal of what we would like them to get to and also seeing the process, all the  
**[0:15:48-0:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:15:48):**  videos of how to make these things are available.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:15:53):**  And then when it comes to training, we work with various different parties.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:15:58):**  So it is not uncommon for us to go to a beach cleanup and work on cleaning the beaches,  
**[0:16:06-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:16:06):**  but then have our machines there out in the open.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:16:10):**  And it's very, very apparent and very quick to realize who is interested and who is not.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:16:17):**  And a lot of the machines right now that we're working with, the ones that we take the beaches  
**[0:16:22-0:16:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:16:22):**  are kind of hand powered.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:16:24):**  It makes it a lot more easy for demonstration, but also it's great to have people involved  
**[0:16:29-0:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:16:29):**  in that level.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:16:31):**  And you can see the enthusiasm and the passion of what often feels like something you only  
**[0:16:37-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:16:37):**  ever see on the internet or it only ever happens in someone else's country.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:16:42):**  But when you're here, Dominicans are often saying, wait, you can do that here?  
**[0:16:46-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:16:46):**  This does this?  
**[0:16:48-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:16:48):**  And the excitement and the enthusiasm that goes through their mind and you can see it  
**[0:16:52-0:16:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:16:52):**  in their eyes is just amazing.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:16:54):**  And even more so amazing with the children.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:16:58):**  We're in the process of working with some of the primary schools in the area.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:17:04):**  And that's about developing long term education schemes, because the reality is that, of course,  
**[0:17:10-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:17:10):**  we're trying to produce materials that we can use for the reconstruction efforts.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:17:16):**  But at the same time, there is a very, very important message that we need to portray  
**[0:17:19-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:17:19):**  and it's the value of plastic.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:17:22):**  And one of the schemes that we're working on setting up is that one of the local primary  
**[0:17:29-0:17:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:17:29):**  schools, to involve their kids, plastic is everywhere and it's in their houses, it's  
**[0:17:34-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:17:34):**  on the streets, it's on the walks to school and it's in the products that they take to  
**[0:17:39-0:17:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:17:39):**  school.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:17:40):**  And all we're now asking is to start collecting that stuff, start collecting those items and  
**[0:17:44-0:17:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:17:44):**  we can turn it into something that benefits the school, like a bench or something like  
**[0:17:50-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:17:50):**  that.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:17:51):**  And suddenly this idea of what happens to things when I recycle just becomes, it's there,  
**[0:17:57-0:17:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:17:57):**  it's in their playground.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:17:58):**  And this isn't really a super new concept, but being able to bring it to a disaster zone  
**[0:18:05-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:18:05):**  is a really exciting thing.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:18:07):**  And recycling has often been out of the reach of the people in Dominica.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:18:11):**  And there is a lot of enthusiasm with these people.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:18:17):**  They want this opportunity and it's great to be a part of it.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:18:19):**  I can imagine because I can think that even outside of disaster response context, there  
**[0:18:25-0:18:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:18:25):**  are many communities that are sort of dying a less urgent and slower death from the influx  
**[0:18:31-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:18:31):**  of plastic waste that is just choking up their environment.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:18:35):**  Would you consider the approach that you've taken in these communities to be something  
**[0:18:41-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:18:41):**  that could be implemented even in these less urgent contexts in developing communities  
**[0:18:47-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:18:47):**  all around the world?  
**[0:18:48-0:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:18:48):**  I can think, for example, how useful that could be even in my own town where I live  
**[0:18:52-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:18:52):**  here in Guatemala.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:18:53):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:18:54):**  So we're in a really interesting time right now because I think plastic has kind of become  
**[0:18:58-0:19:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:18:58):**  a very much of a hot topic, especially across Europe and North America.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:19:03):**  And I think there is a lots of developing countries in around the world and in different  
**[0:19:09-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:19:09):**  situations where the people are interested, but they don't have the tools or the knowledge  
**[0:19:14-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:19:14):**  to do it.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:19:16):**  Now what's great about the open source movement I previously mentioned, Precious Plastic,  
**[0:19:22-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:19:22):**  is that they are empowering people all over the world in any scenario to start recycling.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:19:30):**  And their machines are relatively cheap.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:19:34):**  You're still talking about the $500 mark to make a shredder and the $500 mark to make  
**[0:19:40-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:19:40):**  an injection machine.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:19:41):**  So you're looking about $1,000 US to really set something up, but that is way more achievable  
**[0:19:46-0:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:19:46):**  than most commercial options.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:19:52):**  And then the creativity really comes down to the individuals.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:19:57):**  And there are numerous examples where we've seen people in like Patagonia or Kenya who  
**[0:20:05-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:20:05):**  are starting these little workshops that turn into profitable businesses.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:20:09):**  And I think that's where the model works the best is about where you're taking a waste  
**[0:20:15-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:20:15):**  product that necessarily has no value in most people's eyes, which is completely, utterly  
**[0:20:22-0:20:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:20:22):**  wrong, but then can be turned into something that really does have value or starts promoting  
**[0:20:31-0:20:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:20:31):**  questions and starts developing into a bigger idea.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:20:37):**  One of the most exciting things is to just...  
**[0:20:39-0:20:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:20:39):**  The most simplest thing we can make is a tile.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:20:43):**  And the amount of discussion that develops from bringing a plastic tile to the table  
**[0:20:49-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:20:49):**  and saying this was made from beach plastic or made from salvaged waste or this was made  
**[0:20:55-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:20:55):**  from just bottle caps of whatever, the conversation has started and you realize how much of a  
**[0:21:02-0:21:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:21:02):**  pressing issue it is in everyone's eyes.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:21:06):**  Even if the greatest thing is just to start talking about it, talking about the plastic  
**[0:21:10-0:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:21:10):**  problem because then we all acknowledge it, it just creates momentum.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:21:14):**  But yes, 100%, there is room for every community in the world to have a small recycling center.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:21:22):**  Decentralized approach is always the best.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:21:25):**  I really agree with that.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:21:26):**  And yeah, that's very inspiring.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:21:28):**  Now what care is being taken to steer the design and redevelopment of these communities  
**[0:21:34-0:21:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:21:34):**  in a way that will help to prevent future disasters.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:21:38):**  Because I know a lot of communities that get rebuilt after a flood or a hurricane or an  
**[0:21:43-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:21:43):**  earthquake for example, are often rebuilt much in the same manner as they were originally.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:21:49):**  And the design is completely ignoring the fact that the original one didn't work.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:21:56):**  So how are you combating that and implementing better design for the context in which these  
**[0:22:01-0:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:22:01):**  communities operate?  
**[0:22:05-0:22:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:22:05):**  So I think that question is a really good question.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:22:08):**  And I think you split into kind of two areas actually.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:22:11):**  When you talk about architecture and when we talk about kind of the more waste management  
**[0:22:15-0:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:22:15):**  context.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:22:17):**  And if we go to start on architecture first, I like to call it the kind of like the three  
**[0:22:24-0:22:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:22:24):**  little piggies where you have the first little piggy that had his house made out of hay.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:22:31):**  And the second biggie had it made out of wood.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:22:32):**  And the third one had it made out of brick.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:22:34):**  And the wolf comes to all of them and actually in this scenario, all of the buildings fell  
**[0:22:39-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:22:39):**  down.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:22:42):**  I think we need to rethink that analogy because what we often see in natural disaster zones  
**[0:22:49-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:22:49):**  is build the same building again, but reinforce it more or put more money into it, turn it  
**[0:22:55-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:22:55):**  into a fortress.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:22:58):**  And I think that eventually just becomes unsustainable because you're just building very tall buildings  
**[0:23:03-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:23:03):**  that are never...  
**[0:23:06-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:23:06):**  You're just reinforcing very, very tall buildings that are going to struggle an earthquake or  
**[0:23:10-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:23:10):**  you're reinforcing buildings that are going to struggle in a hurricane.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:23:15):**  It's expensive for nonprofits when the real option is potentially rethinking architecture  
**[0:23:20-0:23:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:23:20):**  entirely and how we imagine it.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:23:23):**  There are numerous examples of where dome structures, because they're aerodynamic, provide  
**[0:23:30-0:23:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:23:30):**  the best structure for a hurricane.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:23:33):**  And at some point where the money needs to be spent is about removing stigma of these  
**[0:23:40-0:23:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:23:40):**  kind of buildings.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:23:42):**  And I wonder at what point a community will turn around to a nonprofit and say, or a government  
**[0:23:47-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:23:47):**  agency and say, stop building me the same building over and over again.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:23:52):**  I realized that a dome structure is going to be safer.  
**[0:23:56-0:23:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:23:56):**  I don't care what it looks like.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:23:59):**  And I think that's the problem.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:24:02):**  We just end up adding more wood and more screws to make the building stronger.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:24:07):**  But then in terms of waste management, as a precedent, Dominica had a recycling center.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:24:19):**  I use the word loosely.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:24:22):**  It had a plastic shredder and people would separate their plastics.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:24:28):**  The plastic would then get taken to the shredder and the plastic would get shredded.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:24:35):**  But then it kind of ended there.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:24:37):**  Unfortunately, it didn't seem to go anywhere.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:24:40):**  It was not closing the loop and it ended up just being a compactor for garbage, more or  
**[0:24:46-0:24:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:24:46):**  less, and the plastic still ended up in landfill.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:24:49):**  Now when the hurricane came, that building that housed that shredder got destroyed and  
**[0:24:56-0:25:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:24:56):**  the shredder was also very, very expensive and a specialist piece of equipment.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:25:04):**  The expertise on the island, never mind the materials or tools, just don't exist to repair  
**[0:25:08-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:25:08):**  it.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:25:09):**  It's not on the priority list because it's an expensive, sadly considered a luxury.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:25:16):**  But in reality, what should be done, and that's why we pursue this, is a much more community-based  
**[0:25:25-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:25:25):**  recycling center, a smaller scale, but the idea that it can be replicated very, very  
**[0:25:29-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:25:29):**  easy.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:25:30):**  Actually, that's kind of our problem because when we bring these solutions to the communities,  
**[0:25:35-0:25:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:25:35):**  the community adopts it and loves it and as a small model, it works.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:25:41):**  But the plastic is a very, very big problem and we can only service small areas or pockets  
**[0:25:47-0:25:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:25:47):**  of Dominica.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:25:48):**  And you do find people coming to us and being like, can we have it in this town?  
**[0:25:51-0:25:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:25:51):**  Can we have it in this town?  
**[0:25:53-0:25:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:25:53):**  And unfortunately, recycling is just not big enough to do that.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:25:58):**  The idea is to sow the seed and provide all the lessons available and share the information  
**[0:26:04-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:26:04):**  as much as we can so that other people can develop this themselves.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:26:09):**  I think the aspiration would be for us to come to a country, put one seed in a town,  
**[0:26:16-0:26:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:26:16):**  and then come back a year later and find out that there's several copycats that have done  
**[0:26:22-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:26:22):**  the same and created sustainable businesses that recycle waste.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:26:28):**  And it would be even more exciting if they take their own twist on it.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:26:31):**  But yeah, it's about decentralizing the approach and making sure that there's numerous spares  
**[0:26:38-0:26:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:26:38):**  on the island and that if something breaks, that it's in the simple machine that can be  
**[0:26:45-0:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:26:45):**  repaired with simple tools and that if they need something that they know where to get  
**[0:26:52-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:26:52):**  it.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:26:53):**  And I think that's the most important thing, knowing where to find the replaceable part.  
**[0:26:57-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:26:57):**  And that's why almost all the items we use are just really off the shelf.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:27:01):**  You're not going to find them at your local Home Depot, but they're definitely around.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:27:08):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:27:09):**  Now, my last main question here is after, I think you said eight disaster recovery zones  
**[0:27:15-0:27:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:27:15):**  and the work that you've done in those places, what have been some of the main things that  
**[0:27:19-0:27:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:27:19):**  you have learned from your experience in these areas and sort of which of the efforts and  
**[0:27:25-0:27:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:27:25):**  projects that you've worked on have achieved their goals to your satisfaction that you  
**[0:27:31-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:27:31):**  would really like to see scaled up and brought to other places in the world?  
**[0:27:36-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:27:36):**  So I would say, you know, the hardest thing for someone to learn is how it feels to be  
**[0:27:43-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:27:43):**  truly scared.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:27:44):**  You know, I think a lot of humanitarian workers come from a life that is incomparable to what  
**[0:27:51-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:27:51):**  or, you know, come on compared to what people have just gone through.  
**[0:27:55-0:28:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:27:55):**  And it is very hard to truly imagine what that situation is like.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:28:00):**  And I remember watching videos of what the Philippines was like, you know, moments after  
**[0:28:04-0:28:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:28:04):**  the disaster and coming to tears, but mainly because I just felt so bad, you know, for  
**[0:28:12-0:28:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:28:12):**  what I felt so terrible about the story, but I didn't know how to really feel what they  
**[0:28:18-0:28:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:28:18):**  felt.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:28:19):**  You know, and going through that disaster in Ecuador really kind of opened my mind to  
**[0:28:23-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:28:23):**  really understand, you know, what it feels like to lose a family member or to be truly  
**[0:28:30-0:28:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:28:30):**  afraid of your life for a fraction of a second because you don't know what's going to happen.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:28:36):**  And then being in that community spirit of, you know, everyone else has just lost something  
**[0:28:41-0:28:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:28:41):**  and then having agencies coming in and telling you that they've all got the solutions.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:28:46):**  So I, you know, I felt that that was a very important thing.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:28:49):**  And for me, Ecuador, the whole project that I did there was a very kind of whole encompassing  
**[0:28:55-0:29:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:28:55):**  thing, because after I went through that disaster and I understood what people, how people felt,  
**[0:29:03-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:29:03):**  the last thing I wanted to be, the last thing I wanted to be in was a concrete building.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:29:10):**  And yet originally, you know, a lot of nonprofits were providing solutions that were concrete.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:29:16):**  And, you know, I felt safest in my bamboo house because it was the building I was working  
**[0:29:23-0:29:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:29:23):**  on before the disaster and it was a building that was still there at the end.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:29:27):**  And, you know, it actually turned out, and this was the kind of second lesson is, sometimes  
**[0:29:33-0:29:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:29:33):**  the cheapest option is actually also the sustainable option.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:29:39):**  It may require a little bit more kind of opening your eyes and rethinking the approach you  
**[0:29:44-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:29:44):**  have to natural disasters and response.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:29:48):**  But, you know, for us as an agency, bamboo was so abundant, you know, and we could treat  
**[0:29:55-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:29:55):**  it sustainably using local products and using traditional values that we were able to create  
**[0:30:04-0:30:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:30:04):**  houses which had a modern twist in terms of they were earthquake resistant and upgraded  
**[0:30:10-0:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:30:10):**  bamboo structures.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:30:12):**  But they actually allowed us to do more.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:30:14):**  They allowed us to have more impact because compared to a concrete house and trying to  
**[0:30:18-0:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:30:18):**  turn that concrete house into, you know, a fortress that was never designed to really  
**[0:30:24-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:30:24):**  withstand earthquakes, you know, we produced something that was, you know, radically different  
**[0:30:29-0:30:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:30:29):**  but sustainable and saved the agency a lot of money, you know.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:30:36):**  And I feel that was my kind of the biggest lesson is, you know, using the same generic  
**[0:30:42-0:30:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:30:42):**  solution in multiple countries doesn't work.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:30:47):**  Everyone's experience is different.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:30:49):**  And, you know, maybe the best architect or the best designer for that solution is someone  
**[0:30:54-0:30:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:30:54):**  who actually went through the disaster.  
**[0:30:56-0:30:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:30:56):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:30:57-0:30:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:30:57):**  I'm really glad you mentioned that.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:30:59):**  That's one of the things that I really like to highlight in not only here in the podcast,  
**[0:31:03-0:31:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:31:03):**  but also in the courses that I teach in that local and customized solutions are oftentimes  
**[0:31:10-0:31:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:31:10):**  really the most, how would you say, like the most long lasting, even if they can be cheaper.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:31:19):**  And there's a lot of forgiveness, especially in natural materials, because either they  
**[0:31:23-0:31:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:31:23):**  re-go and regenerate quickly or they can be infinitely remixed as in the case of like  
**[0:31:29-0:31:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:31:29):**  clay based materials.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:31:30):**  And I think that's what you found in your different experiences as well.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:31:35):**  Yeah.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:31:36):**  Yeah.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:31:37):**  You know, changing the material and rethinking the architectural design is major.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:31:40):**  And, you know, I just find it crazy that nonprofits who respond to disasters that are due to global  
**[0:31:48-0:31:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:31:48):**  warming, you know, their response actually just makes the future disaster more likely.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:31:53):**  You know, the amount of carbon that's in the logistics are bringing everything there.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:31:57):**  The amount of carbon about doing the response, the concrete that is pumped into buildings,  
**[0:32:02-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:32:02):**  you know, are we not OK?  
**[0:32:05-0:32:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:32:05):**  We're preparing for the next disaster, but surely we should start thinking about, you  
**[0:32:09-0:32:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:32:09):**  know, our carbon impact and global warming as a whole.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:32:13):**  Yeah, I completely agree.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:32:15):**  Now before I let you go here, could you tell our listeners how they can get in contact  
**[0:32:19-0:32:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:32:19):**  with you and your organization and where they can go to find out more?  
**[0:32:22-0:32:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:32:22):**  Sure.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:32:23):**  So Recycle Rebuild has a website, of course, and that is www.recyclerebuild.org.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:32:32):**  We are also on Facebook.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:32:33):**  So if you search for us for Recycle Rebuild, you will find us and we're regularly updating  
**[0:32:40-0:32:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:32:40):**  photos and little bits of information about how our project is going in Dominica.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:32:45):**  And the same goes for our Instagram.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:32:48):**  It's recycle underscore rebuild.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:32:51):**  And we post that also.

**[0:32:58-0:32:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:32:58):**  Excellent.

**[0:33:20-0:33:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:33:20):**  as so many of these disaster recovery zones are popping up all over the place and increasingly  
**[0:33:26-0:33:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:33:26):**  in need of smarter, more locally appropriate solutions as well.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:33:32):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:33:33):**  And thanks for having me.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rory-dickens/#t=0:33:34):**  It's been an absolute pleasure.

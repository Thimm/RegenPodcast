### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 07 Jun 2019 18:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:00:13):**  Here we dive deep into the diverse worlds of regenerative living, permaculture, and  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:00:17):**  natural building as we aspire to help you reach your highest potential for yourself,  
**[0:00:22-0:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:00:22):**  for your community, and for this beautiful planet that we share.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:00:25):**  As always, I'm your host Oliver Gaucher, and I'm thrilled to guide you through this  
**[0:00:29-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:00:29):**  week's episode, so let's jump right in!  
**[0:00:59-0:01:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:00:59):**  Alright everybody, before I get started with today's episode, I wanted to let you know  
**[0:01:05-0:01:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:01:05):**  about a new project that I've just launched.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:01:08):**  After years of highlighting and promoting the knowledge, wisdom, and projects of innovators  
**[0:01:12-0:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:01:12):**  and leaders in regenerative living through this podcast, I've realized that this audio  
**[0:01:16-0:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:01:16):**  format can only ever reach so many people.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:01:19):**  There are so many others out there who engage more with other forms of learning.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:01:23):**  That's why I've started the Abundant Edge YouTube channel.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:01:26):**  Now that I'm back on the road and visiting regenerative and sustainable projects in my  
**[0:01:29-0:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:01:29):**  travels, I'll be profiling the people and organizations that are making a real impact  
**[0:01:34-0:01:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:01:34):**  on their environments and their communities.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:01:36):**  My goal is to show as many people as I can reach that you don't have to have a lot  
**[0:01:40-0:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:01:40):**  of money, access to a ton of resources, or have a fancy education under your belt to  
**[0:01:44-0:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:01:44):**  make a real difference in this world and create change.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:01:48):**  My first mini-documentary highlights the unbelievable achievements of a small community called Kisha  
**[0:01:52-0:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:01:52):**  Ya in the highlands of Guatemala.  
**[0:01:55-0:01:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:01:55):**  More than 30 years ago, the land where the village is located was owned by a plantation  
**[0:01:59-0:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:01:59):**  owner who kept the ecosystem under monoculture cultivation and exploited the local people  
**[0:02:04-0:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:02:04):**  who worked for slave wages on the farm.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:02:07):**  After the owner defaulted on his loans, the bank repossessed the land and offered it back  
**[0:02:11-0:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:02:11):**  to the local workers as payment for the wages owed to them.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:02:14):**  The villagers then redistributed their terrain among the original 80 families who took back  
**[0:02:18-0:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:02:18):**  control of the plantation and divided it equally between themselves so they might care for  
**[0:02:23-0:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:02:23):**  it and create a better life for their families.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:02:26):**  Now decades later, the descendants of these pioneers have helped transform the land into  
**[0:02:30-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:02:30):**  a profound abundance which you'll see in the documentary.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:02:33):**  Now if you want to see the rest, you'll have to check it out for yourself.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:02:36):**  You can find it really easily just by typing in abundant edge into the YouTube search bar,  
**[0:02:41-0:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:02:41):**  and be sure to keep an eye out for more short films highlighting the projects that I visit  
**[0:02:44-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:02:44):**  as I travel through Mexico and beyond.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:02:47):**  I'll also be releasing tutorials on everything from design theory to building and gardening  
**[0:02:51-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:02:51):**  techniques in the upcoming months.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:02:53):**  I really hope that this will become a resource that, like the podcast, helps to inspire you  
**[0:02:58-0:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:02:58):**  to live your highest potential by living regeneratively.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:03:01):**  Alright, now continuing this month's focus on fixing the food system, I wanted to go  
**[0:03:06-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:03:06):**  back to basics and discuss the practicalities and challenges of growing your own food, especially  
**[0:03:11-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:03:11):**  with just a modest sized yard.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:03:13):**  So I reached out to Crystal Stevens, who's an author, an artist and art teacher, a folk  
**[0:03:18-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:03:18):**  herbalist and a regenerative farmer and permaculture list.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:03:22):**  She's also the author of two award winning books, Grow, Create, Inspire and Worms at  
**[0:03:27-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:03:27):**  Work.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:03:28):**  And now she's also releasing a new book with New Society publishers early next year called  
**[0:03:31-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:03:31):**  Your Edible Yard.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:03:34):**  So in this interview, I spoke with Crystal about her learning experiences in growing  
**[0:03:37-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:03:37):**  her own food in a few different environments.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:03:39):**  And she also goes in depth about the practicalities of time investment, tools and equipment, and  
**[0:03:44-0:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:03:44):**  maintenance and planting schedules.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:03:46):**  We discuss how realistic it is for someone working full time and with only a small yard  
**[0:03:51-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:03:51):**  to produce a meaningful amount of their own food.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:03:53):**  And we also share some stories of the unexpected joys that make gardening much more of a pleasure  
**[0:03:58-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:03:58):**  than extra work.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:04:00):**  But before I ramble on too much, I'll turn things over now to Crystal.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:04:03):**  Hey, Crystal, thanks so much for taking the time to be with us today.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:04:06):**  How are you doing?  
**[0:04:07-0:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:04:07):**  Great.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:04:08):**  Thank you, Oliver.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:04:09):**  It's a true honor to be here.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:04:10):**  Hey, the pleasure is all mine.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:04:12):**  And I have a ton of questions that I'd love to ask you about how you've gotten started  
**[0:04:16-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:04:16):**  and how you've progressed with growing your own food.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:04:19):**  So what do you say we just jump right in?  
**[0:04:21-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:04:21):**  That sounds wonderful.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:04:22):**  All right.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:04:23):**  So could you tell our listeners first a little bit about your personal background and how  
**[0:04:26-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:04:26):**  you got started growing your own food?  
**[0:04:28-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:04:28):**  Sure.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:04:29):**  So my mother grew irises growing up.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:04:32):**  I was born in Colorado, then we moved in California, and we were there for a while.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:04:38):**  Then we moved to St. Louis.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:04:39):**  My parents were from there and she had wonderful heirloom irises from my great grandmother's  
**[0:04:44-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:04:44):**  garden.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:04:46):**  And so they're now fifth generation iris flowers that we've dug up and transplanted at every  
**[0:04:52-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:04:52):**  location we've ever lived in.  
**[0:04:53-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:04:53):**  So that's irises are very dear to my heart and I even named my daughter Iris.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:05:00):**  So that's a little bit about my first experience with gardening for 15 or so years, give or  
**[0:05:10-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:05:10):**  take.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:05:11):**  I started gardening when I was about 16 years old and I just really fell in love with the  
**[0:05:19-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:05:19):**  farm to table process.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:05:21):**  My entire career has been in gardening and farming and a holistic health.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:05:27):**  Hey, that's a wonderful story.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:05:29):**  It sounds like you have a real heart connection with gardening going all the way back to your  
**[0:05:32-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:05:32):**  childhood.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:05:33):**  But now let's focus a little bit on gardening for the purpose of growing food.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:05:38):**  Now obviously growing food is a much more involved process than just putting seeds in  
**[0:05:42-0:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:05:42):**  the ground and watering them until you have a harvest.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:05:45):**  So could you explain some of the essentials but maybe often overlooked aspects of growing  
**[0:05:50-0:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:05:50):**  your own edible garden?  
**[0:05:52-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:05:52):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:05:53):**  So time is always a huge factor.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:05:57):**  There's so much involved in growing food.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:06:00):**  Really the prepping, the planning, the planting, the weeding, the watering, weeding, watering,  
**[0:06:07-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:06:07):**  seed, and then the harvest of course and what to do with all the abundance.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:06:11):**  But in my opinion and from what I've experienced over the course of the last decade and a half,  
**[0:06:17-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:06:17):**  prepping the ground well the first time by bringing in new soil that's free of weed seeds  
**[0:06:27-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:06:27):**  helps tremendously.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:06:28):**  And as earth stewards, I think, and in the permaculture community, I think that we could  
**[0:06:34-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:06:34):**  all agree that building soil is a key component of regenerative lifestyle.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:06:40):**  And based on the fact that it takes 500 years for a few centimeters of topsoil to form over  
**[0:06:47-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:06:47):**  time, I think it's important that we all do our part to build healthy soils initially.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:06:52):**  So adding that soil organic matter and biomass to our beds initially and preventing the weeds  
**[0:06:59-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:06:59):**  from germinating by way of occultation or sheet mulching or just weed suppression in  
**[0:07:05-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:07:05):**  general, I think that really helps to save a lot of that time.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:07:09):**  So methods of building the soil are adding new soil without weed seeds, sheet mulching,  
**[0:07:18-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:07:18):**  again adding that organic biomass, doing a lot of compost and vermicomposting.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:07:24):**  And then I like to create chip mulch beds as well that build healthy soil over time.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:07:32):**  And then of course, cover cropping can help amend the soil in city lots.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:07:37):**  And especially in urban environments, bringing in new soil is almost crucial because there's  
**[0:07:43-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:07:43):**  a lot of toxins in urban soils and a lot of lead and other contaminants that, and we don't  
**[0:07:49-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:07:49):**  really know the history of those particular urban lots going back 100 years.  
**[0:07:55-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:07:55):**  So it's important to bring in new soil in my opinion.  
**[0:07:58-0:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:07:58):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:07:59):**  Now, I know you do a lot of other methods for building soil, including composting, and  
**[0:08:04-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:08:04):**  you even wrote a book on vermicomposting.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:08:07):**  How much work, let's say time-wise, do you put into those soil building methods and what  
**[0:08:12-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:08:12):**  have you found yield the best results?  
**[0:08:15-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:08:15):**  Sure.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:08:16):**  So cover crops can be achieved even in a prairie setting by simply mowing down those grasses,  
**[0:08:23-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:08:23):**  using a broad fork to loosen the soil and then scattering cover crops.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:08:26):**  And I know there's multiple platforms on growing cover crops and there's multi-species cover  
**[0:08:32-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:08:32):**  crops, which are really important for building healthy soil and adding that organic biomass.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:08:38):**  But it's really not as intimidating as a lot of people think unless you're going big scale  
**[0:08:44-0:08:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:08:44):**  with it, like tons of acres.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:08:46):**  So starting small in a, say, an edible landscape, starting in the fall by using a broad fork  
**[0:08:53-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:08:53):**  just to break up the soil and scattering the seeds right directly into those soil pockets  
**[0:09:03-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:09:03):**  are really helpful to build that healthy soil and create a network of biopores for microbes  
**[0:09:10-0:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:09:10):**  and other living microorganisms to thrive in creating those ecosystems are really crucial.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:09:17):**  All right, so let's switch gears for just a second and talk about the types of crops  
**[0:09:22-0:09:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:09:22):**  that you produce in your own garden.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:09:23):**  Do you focus mainly on annual production or perennials and trees as well?  
**[0:09:29-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:09:29):**  So it's a little unique where we are.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:09:31):**  We're renting 10 acres in Godfrey, Illinois along the bluffs of the Mississippi River  
**[0:09:36-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:09:36):**  and we have 10 acres that is mostly wooded and we have some open area as well.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:09:43):**  And so for us, since we're renting, we're not investing a lot of money in fruit trees  
**[0:09:49-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:09:49):**  at the moment, but we are stewarding areas where, for example, persimmons saplings kept  
**[0:09:56-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:09:56):**  coming up in an area where we were mowing the grass.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:10:00):**  We have to keep the grass mowed because of our landlord specific areas of the landscape.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:10:05):**  But my husband noticed that the persimmons saplings kept coming up and so we decided  
**[0:10:10-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:10:10):**  to just create a persimmon grove and to mow around those saplings.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:10:15):**  And then we added sheet mulch and started integrating polyculture plantings.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:10:21):**  So we put in some perennials and nitrogen fixers and dynamic accumulators and allium  
**[0:10:27-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:10:27):**  family plants.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:10:29):**  And so now it's a little wonderful persimmons grove that has multi-species in it and it's  
**[0:10:35-0:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:10:35):**  really beautiful.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:10:37):**  But for our edible landscapes, we do a nice combination of perennials, annuals, medicinals,  
**[0:10:45-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:10:45):**  culinary herbs.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:10:46):**  So we're creating a polyculture in the front of our house, on the side of our house, and  
**[0:10:51-0:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:10:51):**  then in our small scale diversified vegetable patch where we're taking our produce to a  
**[0:10:58-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:10:58):**  farmer's market.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:10:59):**  So I would say polyculture is all the way and I'm really a fan of perennials.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:11:05):**  Though because we don't own the land, it's going to be hard to say goodbye to these perennials  
**[0:11:12-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:11:12):**  if we have to leave.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:11:13):**  So I'm trying to do perennials that we can bring divisions with us when we leave.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:11:19):**  So that's a really important component to our specific situation.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:11:23):**  Yeah, that's totally understandable.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:11:25):**  Now let's focus a little bit on the garden that you have at home because I think that's  
**[0:11:29-0:11:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:11:29):**  going to be more common to the context that a lot of our listeners are coming from.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:11:34):**  So how realistic do you think it is for someone with say a full-time job away from the home  
**[0:11:39-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:11:39):**  to grow a significant portion of their own food?  
**[0:11:42-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:11:42):**  Sure.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:11:43):**  So we were commuting to work for two years.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:11:48):**  We drove an hour plus each way every day and we still were able to, and we were working  
**[0:11:55-0:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:11:55):**  on a farm in Ferguson, but we were still able to grow a lot of our own food on our own site  
**[0:12:02-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:12:02):**  as well.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:12:03):**  So we got a nice farm share from the farm we were growing at and we also had a really  
**[0:12:08-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:12:08):**  abundant harvest even with very little work because the last thing you want to do after  
**[0:12:13-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:12:13):**  farming all day is come home and farm.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:12:16):**  So we were able to get by with just spending some weekend hours and maybe an hour after  
**[0:12:22-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:12:22):**  work each day focusing on some of the projects and a lot of it was harvesting.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:12:30):**  But I think it's very realistic.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:12:31):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:12:32):**  So within that realistic timeframe and the constraints of your jobs, what portion of  
**[0:12:38-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:12:38):**  your food came directly out of your garden?  
**[0:12:42-0:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:12:42):**  So I would say on average, we grow at least 70% of our own food.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:12:51):**  That doesn't include dairy or meats.  
**[0:12:54-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:12:54):**  I'm mostly vegan, but my family eats meat and they drink dairy products as well.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:13:02):**  So for me, I could live in the garden and get all of my nutrients from there aside from  
**[0:13:07-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:13:07):**  coffee and chocolate.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:13:10):**  But for my family, it's a little more challenging.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:13:12):**  So we were able to put up a lot of our food for the winter, which was really important  
**[0:13:17-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:13:17):**  when we weren't receiving fresh produce over the winter.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:13:20):**  So I do a lot of canning and preserving.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:13:22):**  So I would say over the course of the time that we've been farming, we've been able to  
**[0:13:27-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:13:27):**  grow 90% of our own food and then rely on neighboring farms that offer pastured meats  
**[0:13:36-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:13:36):**  and buying milk from a local source and things of that nature, though we still try to shop  
**[0:13:44-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:13:44):**  at grocery stores to meet our other needs.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:13:48):**  So I would say that it's doable.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:13:51):**  It depends on how much land you have, how big your backyard is.  
**[0:13:55-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:13:55):**  If it's someone in an apartment building just growing on their balcony, I don't think that  
**[0:14:00-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:14:00):**  they can meet much of their food needs.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:14:02):**  But if it's someone with a nice big backyard, it's very doable with just maybe five to 10  
**[0:14:09-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:14:09):**  hours per week dedicated to weed suppression and sheep mulching and maintaining their crops.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:14:17):**  And I think it's very realistic.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:14:18):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:14:19):**  So let's talk then about how much food someone could potentially produce on, let's say, common  
**[0:14:25-0:14:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:14:25):**  spaces that people in urban or suburban environments are likely to have access to.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:14:31):**  So what do you think the food producing potential of, say, a 10th of an acre or maybe even just  
**[0:14:35-0:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:14:35):**  a small patch of a yard would be able to produce?  
**[0:14:39-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:14:39):**  Sure.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:14:40):**  So as long as their diet is mostly fruits and vegetables, I think that you can do at  
**[0:14:45-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:14:45):**  least 90 percent of your food in terms of bulk amount of vegetables and fruits that  
**[0:14:53-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:14:53):**  you could not only eat fresh but also put up for the winter.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:14:58):**  That might be unrealistic for people who have other dietary needs, but for people who focus  
**[0:15:07-0:15:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:15:07):**  mostly on fruits and vegetables, I think it's very realistic to do that.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:15:12):**  Now, integrating chickens and other livestock is a way, like all of the polyculture farms  
**[0:15:19-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:15:19):**  and people integrating livestock into their vegetable production operations and doing  
**[0:15:25-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:15:25):**  lots of transitioning and crop rotations and rotating their pasture in their cover crop  
**[0:15:33-0:15:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:15:33):**  areas.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:15:34):**  That's more of a win-win for those looking to diversify their diet.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:15:41):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:15:43):**  It does require an interest in some of those other enterprises because, like you said,  
**[0:15:49-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:15:49):**  if you have dietary restrictions and don't eat animal products, that might not be of  
**[0:15:52-0:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:15:52):**  interest.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:15:53):**  But I've definitely found from my own experience farming that bringing in other species, even  
**[0:15:58-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:15:58):**  if you're not eating their products, can cut down on the amount of work, especially soil  
**[0:16:03-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:16:03):**  building that you do in the case of chickens or manure from other animals.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:16:07):**  But obviously, we have to factor that in with the restrictions that you might have where  
**[0:16:11-0:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:16:11):**  you live, especially in an urban environment.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:16:15):**  Most definitely.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:16:16):**  But I think in the urban setting, I know a lot of people who meet a great percentage  
**[0:16:24-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:16:24):**  of their food needs.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:16:25):**  And I might be a little unrealistic when I say 90 percent, but if you look at individuals  
**[0:16:31-0:16:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:16:31):**  like Rob Greenfield, who is doing remarkable work right now, he's committed one full year  
**[0:16:36-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:16:36):**  to foraging or growing all of his own foods.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:16:40):**  And yes, he has his struggles and he makes sure to be very transparent about the struggles  
**[0:16:46-0:16:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:16:46):**  that comes along with it.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:16:47):**  But he's doing it.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:16:48):**  And so it can be done.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:16:50):**  Meeting 100 percent of your food needs on your own can be done with sacrifice, for sure.  
**[0:16:56-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:16:56):**  Yeah, I agree.  
**[0:16:57-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:16:57):**  I really like his work as well.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:16:59):**  I've been following his videos and I'll try and put a link in the show notes to one of  
**[0:17:03-0:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:17:03):**  his videos that outlines his project and how he's getting along.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:17:06):**  It's very eye opening.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:17:07):**  And like you said, it's certainly it's not for everybody.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:17:10):**  And it's pretty much a full time job in his case.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:17:13):**  But the insights that you gain from that and kind of figuring out how many of the things  
**[0:17:18-0:17:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:17:18):**  he's doing would be realistic for your context, I find really inspiring as well.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:17:23):**  So as far as time invested, if we just want to break it down by numbers or make it kind  
**[0:17:29-0:17:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:17:29):**  of efficient for someone to get started for calories harvested, what is your best food  
**[0:17:37-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:17:37):**  crop that you've invested in as far as yield and time invested?  
**[0:17:41-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:17:41):**  Sure.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:17:42):**  So I say the perennials certainly are the leaders on that front.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:17:49):**  You know, you buy perennial plants and a lot of them, you know, send out runners such as  
**[0:17:55-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:17:55):**  strawberries and provide a really abundant harvest.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:17:59):**  Now, while their harvest window might be small, you can get everbearing varieties of strawberries  
**[0:18:05-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:18:05):**  that fruit multiple times per year.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:18:07):**  And the abundance is so prolific that you can put up a lot of those strawberries in  
**[0:18:12-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:18:12):**  freezer in the freezer for later use or can and preserve them.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:18:17):**  So one of my favorites is strawberries, of course.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:18:21):**  You know, over the last almost decade, I've been studying a lot of permaculture plants.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:18:28):**  And one of our dear friends, Matt Liebahn, does a lot of the really wonderful permaculture  
**[0:18:34-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:18:34):**  darling plants, as he calls them, and has introduced me to a variety of species such  
**[0:18:39-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:18:39):**  as the gumi berry, which is a nitrogen fixing perennial fruiting shrub.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:18:44):**  It's related to the autumn olive, but it's a non-invasive variety.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:18:48):**  And I mean, there's thousands of these little gumi berries on one shrub, and they're just  
**[0:18:55-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:18:55):**  about to set fruit here in the next couple of weeks.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:19:00):**  But they will be very prolific for a long time, and you can really harvest them over  
**[0:19:07-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:19:07):**  and over.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:19:08):**  And another favorite is the Juneberry.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:19:11):**  It's the amalantra or serviceberry, and luckily we have a native variety of that here.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:19:17):**  Things like Juneberries are really prolific.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:19:20):**  They're disease and pest resistant.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:19:22):**  They are adapted to this climate, and they provide an abundant harvest.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:19:26):**  It's a wonderful alternative to blueberries, which are very prone to disease and pests,  
**[0:19:31-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:19:31):**  and they require very particular acidic soil.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:19:36):**  So getting varieties that are not only acclimated to your zone, but are disease and pest resistant  
**[0:19:44-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:19:44):**  is really crucial.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:19:45):**  Some other varieties that we love are Nanking cherries, which provide an abundant yield.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:19:51):**  I'm a huge fan of all of the medicinal herbs.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:19:56):**  As an herbalist, I make my own tinctures and herbal salves and oxy mills and a variety  
**[0:20:02-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:20:02):**  of medicinal applications.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:20:04):**  And so I always integrate medicinals into my polycultures.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:20:10):**  Of course, the perennial culinary herbs, which are also highly medicinal.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:20:15):**  There are so many uses from chimichurries to pestos.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:20:19):**  You can do so much with the culinary herbs.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:20:23):**  Matt Lebaun also turned us on to the Turkish rocket broccoli, which is a perennial broccoli.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:20:32):**  And we had been growing Silveta arugula, but not necessarily as a perennial before.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:20:38):**  And so trying to find a lot of the perennial fruit producing shrubs, but also the perennial  
**[0:20:44-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:20:44):**  vegetables is really crucial to having an abundant harvest.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:20:50):**  I really love that you focus on those recommendations because that's usually one of the first things  
**[0:20:55-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:20:55):**  that I help to research for when I have clients who are looking to grow their own food as  
**[0:20:59-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:20:59):**  well.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:21:00):**  And that's to figure out which edible perennials, first of all, are native and grow really well  
**[0:21:05-0:21:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:21:05):**  in that context.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:21:06):**  And then just seeing what kind of variety that you can sort of explore because I found  
**[0:21:13-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:21:13):**  that they do really well along the edge space where people often don't focus on tilling  
**[0:21:19-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:21:19):**  or soil preparation nearly as much and they kind of stay in the center for their annual  
**[0:21:23-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:21:23):**  production.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:21:24):**  But because they need so much less maintenance and though it may take a little while for  
**[0:21:28-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:21:28):**  them to mature and actually start fruiting or start producing, once they do, like you  
**[0:21:33-0:21:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:21:33):**  said, if you selected your varieties right, if they're hardened for your climate and your  
**[0:21:38-0:21:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:21:38):**  context, you barely have to do much to them after that.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:21:42):**  Sometimes it's just a matter of keeping them under control and keeping them from taking  
**[0:21:46-0:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:21:46):**  over other spaces.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:21:48):**  Totally.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:21:49):**  Some other varieties that I really enjoy are elderberries.  
**[0:21:53-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:21:53):**  And we get our elderberry starts as cuttings, stem cuttings from River Hills Harvest.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:22:00):**  And they have a nice array of really nutrient-rich elderberry varieties.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:22:06):**  Elderberries are so rich in antioxidants and vitamins and minerals and they're super medicinal  
**[0:22:11-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:22:11):**  and you can make elderberry syrup.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:22:13):**  So I really appreciate all of the fruits with that medicinal component such as zaronia berry,  
**[0:22:20-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:22:20):**  which is a very amazing antioxidant fruit.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:22:24):**  I really love mulberry trees.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:22:27):**  And so we do a lot of foraging locally for mulberries as well.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:22:31):**  And it's just about to be mulberry season coming up in a few weeks.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:22:35):**  They're starting to ripen.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:22:38):**  The Asian pear is a really wonderful prolific disease and pest resistant tree that grows  
**[0:22:45-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:22:45):**  really well here as well as the red haven peach and the liberty apple.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:22:51):**  So those are just a few of the fruit trees.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:22:54):**  And then of course pawpaws and persimmons are native to this region and pawpaws are  
**[0:22:59-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:22:59):**  the largest fruit indigenous to North America.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:23:02):**  So there's a lot of folks in this area who are propagating pawpaws and growing and cross-pollinating  
**[0:23:10-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:23:10):**  them as well.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:23:11):**  Yeah, when you get into it, there's such a cool variety.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:23:15):**  And this ain't nothing about the nutrition and the flavors.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:23:18):**  I mean, there's so much to appreciate and to rediscover about perennials.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:23:22):**  It's strange to me how they've kind of fallen out of favor in industrial agriculture over  
**[0:23:28-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:23:28):**  the last handful of decades.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:23:30):**  It's fantastic to see them coming back in a really big way, especially in permaculture  
**[0:23:35-0:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:23:35):**  and home grower communities.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:23:38):**  Yes.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:23:39):**  While I do love the perennials, we also integrate a lot of annuals that are prolific producers  
**[0:23:45-0:23:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:23:45):**  like sugar snap peas and green beans.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:23:48):**  We're growing about 10 different varieties of green beans from Baker Creek heirloom seeds  
**[0:23:54-0:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:23:54):**  this year.  
**[0:23:55-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:23:55):**  And as well as I love the peppers.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:23:58):**  If I could find perennial peppers, that would be really wonderful.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:24:03):**  Peppers are some of the easiest and most delicious.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:24:08):**  In a food as medicine presentation I gave, so many people were surprised at the fact  
**[0:24:14-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:24:14):**  that peppers have more vitamin C than oranges.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:24:18):**  So just trying to figure out the types of vegetables that you can use to supplement  
**[0:24:24-0:24:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:24:24):**  as very nutritious components to your diet are also really important.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:24:30):**  And of course we like tomatoes and rainbow chard looks beautiful in a landscape.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:24:36):**  Some things that we're really excited about this year, I have never tried huckleberries  
**[0:24:40-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:24:40):**  or wonderberries and I ordered the seed from Baker Creek and they're doing really well.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:24:44):**  I have yet to experience the fruit of either, but we shall see.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:24:49):**  There's always something to look forward to.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:24:51):**  And I mean, man, don't get me started on chilies right now.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:24:54):**  I'm traveling through Southern Mexico at the moment and the variety of chilies, both fresh  
**[0:24:58-0:25:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:24:58):**  and dried that you find in the markets here and the way that it's integrated into the  
**[0:25:02-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:25:02):**  native cuisine is just, oh man, you have to be here to experience it.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:25:06):**  But before we get too carried away with those, let's switch gears for a second here and talk  
**[0:25:11-0:25:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:25:11):**  about how to extend the growing season or the harvest season for as long as possible.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:25:17):**  Now I know you live in an area with a long winter and that's how I grew up as well though.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:25:22):**  I've moved around the world a lot.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:25:24):**  So let's talk about which of the crops that you grow store best over the winter and in  
**[0:25:29-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:25:29):**  the off seasons.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:25:30):**  Like how much difference does planning ahead and deciding in advance kind of what you'll  
**[0:25:35-0:25:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:25:35):**  be planning the seasons to come make as far as a difference of the food that you'll be  
**[0:25:40-0:25:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:25:40):**  harvesting throughout those seasons?  
**[0:25:42-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:25:42):**  Sure.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:25:43):**  So we're very much a fan of crop planning in the fall for the next growing season.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:25:49):**  And I like to extend that crop planning throughout the winter when the fields are dormant.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:25:54):**  But yeah, we take that into consideration.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:25:57):**  We definitely look at the first and last frost dates to make sure that these varieties are  
**[0:26:03-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:26:03):**  going to push through.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:26:05):**  Kale has always been a superstar in terms of season extension.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:26:08):**  It just naturally does really well in cold climates.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:26:14):**  We've had kale go throughout December and then return again after the spring thaw.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:26:21):**  Broccoli has withstood many of frosts as well.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:26:26):**  In terms of storage crops, we focus a lot on winter storage carrots and butternut squash.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:26:33):**  Butternut squash thrives really well in this environment and a butternut squash can last  
**[0:26:39-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:26:39):**  up to six months, in my experience, if stored properly.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:26:44):**  So we focus a lot on those particular annuals as season extension.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:26:50):**  And then we do a lot of canning and freezing and preserving in order to have nutrient-rich  
**[0:26:56-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:26:56):**  produce throughout the winter months.  
**[0:26:58-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:26:58):**  Nice.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:26:59):**  So could you walk me through an example of how you plan your own garden?  
**[0:27:05-0:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:27:05):**  You've got a process at this point.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:27:07):**  So let's go through from the beginning until when you start planting.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:27:11):**  Sure.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:27:13):**  So obviously, in any new situation of growing food, it's good to observe the site.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:27:21):**  Is there a slope?  
**[0:27:22-0:27:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:27:22):**  How much sun or how many hours of sunlight per day does your site receive?  
**[0:27:28-0:27:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:27:28):**  What type of soil do you have?  
**[0:27:30-0:27:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:27:30):**  Is it a nice mixture of sand, silt, and clay?  
**[0:27:33-0:27:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:27:33):**  There's many components in the observation realm to consider how water moves across your  
**[0:27:39-0:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:27:39):**  terrain.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:27:41):**  Do you even have access to water?  
**[0:27:42-0:27:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:27:42):**  Because that is a very important factor here in the Midwest.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:27:46):**  While we get tons of spring rain, there tends to be sometimes upwards of a two-month drought.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:27:52):**  And so having access to water is very important.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:27:56):**  Even better is collecting your own rainwater and having irrigation or soaker hoses set  
**[0:28:02-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:28:02):**  up through your rainwater collection system.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:28:06):**  And so we like to focus on the varieties we love to eat or that we know will do well at  
**[0:28:13-0:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:28:13):**  the farmers market.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:28:14):**  So we usually start with discussing what didn't go well the previous year, what had disease  
**[0:28:20-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:28:20):**  issues or pest issues.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:28:22):**  And we try to either omit that from our plan or find disease and pest resistant varieties  
**[0:28:29-0:28:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:28:29):**  of those crops.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:28:31):**  And they're always coming up with new ones.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:28:32):**  Plant breeders are really amazing in terms of creating new varieties that are disease  
**[0:28:38-0:28:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:28:38):**  and pest resistant.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:28:40):**  And so we do like a brainstorm session about what we want to grow and what we should grow  
**[0:28:46-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:28:46):**  more of or less of.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:28:48):**  You know, you can never have too many rainbow carrots, but there is such a thing as too  
**[0:28:53-0:29:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:28:53):**  much kohlrabi or, you know, too many radishes, too many turnips, you know.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:29:00):**  But never enough cherry tomatoes, never enough berries.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:29:05):**  So really focusing more and more on the things that people actually love to eat and buy at  
**[0:29:10-0:29:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:29:10):**  the farmers market is one of the things that we consider.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:29:14):**  So we look at the seed catalogs and pick out any new varieties that we want to try.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:29:19):**  We have our crop plan all laid out in terms of crop rotation and where we're going to  
**[0:29:27-0:29:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:29:27):**  plant things followed by cover crops.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:29:31):**  And we have, you know, at Earth Dance Organic Farm School where my husband was farm manager,  
**[0:29:37-0:29:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:29:37):**  they had a very detailed crop plan that focused a lot on bed per square feet and what is the  
**[0:29:44-0:29:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:29:44):**  financial yield and the actual poundage per bed square foot.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:29:49):**  So they had it mapped out down to a science almost.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:29:52):**  And it was really amazing to witness that part of farming.  
**[0:29:56-0:29:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:29:56):**  I'm more of an organic person myself.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:29:58):**  I like to plant the seeds and, you know, maintain the plants and do the harvesting.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:30:04):**  I'm not really a math person.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:30:06):**  And so for me, that sort of really detailed crop planning sometimes takes the magic out  
**[0:30:12-0:30:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:30:12):**  of it for me.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:30:14):**  So I like to just do a lot of trials and to document the process through photojournalism  
**[0:30:22-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:30:22):**  and write articles throughout the season of what's growing good and, you know, what's  
**[0:30:27-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:30:27):**  prolific and new perennials that we're trying out.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:30:31):**  And then, you know, we do our soil building.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:30:34):**  We make sure that we're adding compost.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:30:37):**  And then we do our planting or transplanting, of course, on the things that require a fine  
**[0:30:43-0:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:30:43):**  tilth bed.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:30:44):**  We spend more time getting that soil really prepared.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:30:49):**  And we make our raised beds, permanent raised beds, then we do occultation, which is the  
**[0:30:53-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:30:53):**  tarping.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:30:54):**  We use old billboards.  
**[0:30:56-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:30:56):**  And after four to six weeks, we take those off and it's ready to transplant.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:31:01):**  Then we transplant or sow our seeds and then sheet mulch the pathways to prevent weeds  
**[0:31:07-0:31:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:31:07):**  from coming up.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:31:08):**  And then we always apply a heavy mulch layer or usually leaf mulch or combination of compost  
**[0:31:14-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:31:14):**  and leaf mulch around our transplants.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:31:17):**  And then, of course, on the seed sown beds, we really have to focus on hula hoeing and  
**[0:31:23-0:31:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:31:23):**  hand weeding.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:31:25):**  And then there's always irrigation.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:31:27):**  So we do either drip tape or hand watering or sprinklers.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:31:32):**  Yeah, I really like what you mentioned back there about the two different ways of sort  
**[0:31:37-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:31:37):**  of managing a garden.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:31:38):**  And I love that you, you know, sort of voiced your preference for doing things in more of  
**[0:31:42-0:31:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:31:42):**  an organic way that kind of goes with the flow.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:31:44):**  You plant things, see what happens.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:31:47):**  And juxtapose that with like, you know, a very rigid planting schedule where everything  
**[0:31:53-0:31:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:31:53):**  is laid out all the way down to the day and the rotations and things are scheduled because  
**[0:31:58-0:32:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:31:58):**  I personally kind of fall in between that.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:32:00):**  I love the discovery that comes from just trying things out and see what happens, especially  
**[0:32:05-0:32:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:32:05):**  with varieties.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:32:07):**  And when I get to new places where I'm not as sure of, you know, the growing season or  
**[0:32:12-0:32:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:32:12):**  the fluctuations in the seasons.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:32:14):**  But I also have found too that after a little while, there's certain things that if you  
**[0:32:18-0:32:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:32:18):**  can systematize them, it really does make it a lot easier.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:32:22):**  But I think there's such an opportunity for people to add their own personalities, their  
**[0:32:26-0:32:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:32:26):**  hearts, their artistry into their garden.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:32:29):**  And I've always seen that start to come out and flourish once people kind of get bit by  
**[0:32:33-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:32:33):**  the bug of the potential of growing your own food and interacting with the land and the  
**[0:32:39-0:32:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:32:39):**  natural systems that come through it.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:32:41):**  So like everybody has their different expression of how they end up gardening.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:32:45):**  Sure.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:32:46):**  And as you mentioned, working with nature rather than against it on a lot of the methodical  
**[0:32:51-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:32:51):**  garden plans, you know, the one thing that's not factored in is a heavy rainfall that lasts  
**[0:32:57-0:33:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:32:57):**  for seven days or a drought that could significantly set back your harvest dates or planting dates.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:33:05):**  So really going with the nature's flow and understanding that, you know, we are not in control of this  
**[0:33:11-0:33:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:33:11):**  garden ultimately, that we have to sort of put our hands up at times.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:33:18):**  And you know, we really got that experience lessened so hard when we were CSA farmers.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:33:27):**  So my husband and I for seven years managed La Vista CSA farm where we had 250 members  
**[0:33:33-0:33:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:33:33):**  who would pick up weekly produce.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:33:35):**  And we were on seven acres and it was mostly mechanical cultivation and mechanical forms  
**[0:33:41-0:33:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:33:41):**  of planting like tractors.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:33:42):**  And we were on a tillage based system and using a lot of implementation, but we were  
**[0:33:47-0:33:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:33:47):**  trying to integrate cover cropping and building healthy soils while we were doing that.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:33:53):**  So it was sort of a trial by fire because we started as backyard gardeners who wanted  
**[0:33:59-0:34:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:33:59):**  to build healthy soil.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:34:00):**  And one of our gardening mentors, Jim Allmond in his 90s, was out there in the Salem Community  
**[0:34:07-0:34:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:34:07):**  Garden when my husband first started farming together.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:34:10):**  And he would always tell everyone that came into the garden, you don't have good garden  
**[0:34:14-0:34:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:34:14):**  soil unless you can stick your hand down into your soil and the level reaches your elbow.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:34:20):**  So I don't know anyone who has garden soil quite like that except for Jim Allmond.  
**[0:34:26-0:34:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:34:26):**  Yeah, that's intense.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:34:28):**  Right.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:34:29):**  But as the CSA farmers, it was a whole different level of pressure because you had shareholders  
**[0:34:37-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:34:37):**  that were expecting a specific poundage of vegetables each week.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:34:43):**  And nature had its own course that would oftentimes catch us off guard or things that we couldn't  
**[0:34:51-0:34:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:34:51):**  prepare for like a heavy windstorm or hail or, you know, 60 mile an hour winds or rain  
**[0:34:59-0:35:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:34:59):**  that lasted, you know, 12 days and heavy, heavy rains.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:35:03):**  So really being CSA farmers was not for us.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:35:10):**  We loved it while it lasted, but we realized that the pressure of giving people the things  
**[0:35:18-0:35:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:35:18):**  that they wanted and having them complain when they didn't get tomatoes and instead  
**[0:35:22-0:35:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:35:22):**  got kohlrabi, well, it was just the nature of the farming at that point.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:35:27):**  And then we went from there to Earthdance Organic Farm School where they did everything  
**[0:35:32-0:35:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:35:32):**  in a no-till way, which is really close to our hearts.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:35:35):**  They really focused on soil health and it was miraculous.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:35:38):**  It's a 14 acre historic farm in the heart of Ferguson.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:35:42):**  And so we were doing everything organically.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:35:45):**  It was certified organic and we were focusing on soil health as the number one priority.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:35:50):**  So that really spoke to us more.  
**[0:35:54-0:35:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:35:54):**  And they didn't have a CSA, which was nice.  
**[0:35:56-0:36:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:35:56):**  So we at that point just sold to chefs and farmers markets.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:36:02):**  And so my husband and I, after just realizing that we didn't want to go back to tillage  
**[0:36:09-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:36:09):**  based systems, but we really loved, you know, kind of being on our own time schedule.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:36:15):**  We were commuting an hour plus each way daily and our kids went from roaming the fields  
**[0:36:21-0:36:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:36:21):**  and being with us all day at the farm to being stuck in daycare for about eight to nine hours  
**[0:36:27-0:36:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:36:27):**  a day.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:36:28):**  So at that point we decided to branch out and we started our own business called Flourish,  
**[0:36:33-0:36:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:36:33):**  which we are focusing on a farm.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:36:35):**  It's a micro farm, a plant nursery, which we focus a lot on the perennial permaculture  
**[0:36:41-0:36:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:36:41):**  darlings and a lot of annuals and vegetable heirlooms as well.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:36:46):**  And we also do education and design and I have a line of herbal products through a small  
**[0:36:52-0:36:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:36:52):**  apothecary.  
**[0:36:53-0:36:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:36:53):**  So at this point in our lives, we're really excited to bring all of that knowledge and  
**[0:36:59-0:37:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:36:59):**  wisdom and our, you know, 10 plus years of resilient living workshop series to the education  
**[0:37:05-0:37:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:37:05):**  front and a part of that is also teaching permaculture design courses.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:37:10):**  And so that's a really exciting, we're in a transition point.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:37:14):**  We have been for the last six months and it's just super exciting to just be able to plant  
**[0:37:19-0:37:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:37:19):**  whatever we want and figure it out from there.  
**[0:37:23-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:37:23):**  Oh, I can imagine.  
**[0:37:25-0:37:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:37:25):**  I personally am in a transition period of my own having just left the farm business  
**[0:37:29-0:37:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:37:29):**  from Guatemala, traveling through Mexico and trying to find out where I can apply my skills  
**[0:37:34-0:37:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:37:34):**  and experience at this point.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:37:36):**  And I think you'll agree that these transition periods, aside from being a little bit scary  
**[0:37:40-0:37:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:37:40):**  and sometimes overwhelming offer, if you know, you can calm down and enjoy it for a moment,  
**[0:37:46-0:37:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:37:46):**  the possibility of exploring all sorts of things that the confines of previous jobs  
**[0:37:50-0:37:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:37:50):**  or the demands of previous lifestyles didn't give you.  
**[0:37:54-0:37:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:37:54):**  And oftentimes the takeaways from this have given me the opportunity to launch into new  
**[0:37:59-0:38:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:37:59):**  things that were beyond what I could have anticipated before these transition periods.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:38:04):**  Oh, that's so true.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:38:06):**  And you know, even just lunchtime on the farm here at the farm, you know, we get to slow  
**[0:38:12-0:38:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:38:12):**  down a little bit and cook a nice healthy lunch, just go right outside and harvest and  
**[0:38:16-0:38:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:38:16):**  prepare a nice lunch or brunch with our eggs from our chickens and micro greens that we  
**[0:38:22-0:38:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:38:22):**  may be growing in our windowsill or sprouts.  
**[0:38:25-0:38:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:38:25):**  And then, you know, step outside to get the berries and the roots and the leaf vegetables  
**[0:38:31-0:38:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:38:31):**  that are growing right outside of our front door.  
**[0:38:33-0:38:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:38:33):**  So it's a really exciting.  
**[0:38:34-0:38:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:38:34):**  Man, you're totally living the dream there.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:38:38):**  And you mentioned something earlier, like how you didn't always produce all of the things  
**[0:38:43-0:38:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:38:43):**  for your entire diet, especially some of the indulgences like coffee and chocolate.  
**[0:38:48-0:38:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:38:48):**  Well, I happen to be passing through and profiling a family that is doing a reforestation effort  
**[0:38:54-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:38:54):**  here in Veracruz in Mexico.  
**[0:38:56-0:39:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:38:56):**  And the main thing that they do for income right now is actually buying from local producers  
**[0:39:01-0:39:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:39:01):**  in the area, which includes organic cacao, organic coffee and organic pasture raised  
**[0:39:08-0:39:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:39:08):**  milk.  
**[0:39:09-0:39:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:39:09):**  And they turn it into chocolate, vegan chocolate.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:39:14):**  They process and roast their own coffee and they make their own ice cream from the cream  
**[0:39:19-0:39:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:39:19):**  of the milk and the goats and like five different types of cheeses from soft cheese to hard  
**[0:39:25-0:39:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:39:25):**  cheese.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:39:26):**  And I can't tell you how good it is.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:39:28):**  I'm in the process of making videos about it right now.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:39:31):**  So I'll definitely keep you posted when I've got those to release.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:39:33):**  Oh, please do.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:39:35):**  Maybe we can mail each other some goodies.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:39:41):**  Or even better, next time you get a chance to vacation, come down and see the reforestation  
**[0:39:45-0:39:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:39:45):**  efforts and then just like buy the good stuff in bulk.  
**[0:39:48-0:39:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:39:48):**  That sounds like a dream.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:39:50):**  Speaking of chocolate, one of my first experiences with permaculture was at Punta Mona in Costa  
**[0:39:57-0:39:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:39:57):**  Rica.  
**[0:39:58-0:39:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:39:58):**  Steven Brooks.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:39:59):**  Yeah.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:40:00):**  So he has 80 acres off the grid.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:40:02):**  I'm sure he has more land by now there, but he started this amazing food forest and he's  
**[0:40:07-0:40:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:40:07):**  brought in so many wonderful groups and also teaches permaculture design courses.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:40:14):**  And one of the components through my time there was he took us on a visit to the Bribri  
**[0:40:20-0:40:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:40:20):**  tribe and we got to witness the process of making chocolate from the seed all the way  
**[0:40:26-0:40:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:40:26):**  through the entire process.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:40:28):**  And that was so magical.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:40:29):**  I can't even imagine what you're experiencing right now.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:40:32):**  It's profound.  
**[0:40:33-0:40:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:40:33):**  Yeah.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:40:34):**  I mean, it's the benefit of being in this transition period and having a big network  
**[0:40:39-0:40:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:40:39):**  of permaculture and sustainable projects and regenerative enterprises.  
**[0:40:44-0:40:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:40:44):**  So I'm trying to make use of it as I make my way back to the States to visit family.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:40:48):**  But here, let's switch gears again just for a second and tell me a little bit about, like  
**[0:40:53-0:40:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:40:53):**  I know what your opinion is going to be on this because of what you've talked about already,  
**[0:40:56-0:41:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:40:56):**  but you have experience both from commercial farms with like deadlines and customers to  
**[0:41:01-0:41:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:41:01):**  please and now this new freedom in your own garden to try out different things.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:41:06):**  And so my question is, do you find that having a large variety of crops, including flowers,  
**[0:41:10-0:41:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:41:10):**  medicinals and others is worth the loss in efficiency?  
**[0:41:14-0:41:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:41:14):**  Obviously in your context, just producing for yourself, it makes sense, but would you  
**[0:41:20-0:41:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:41:20):**  have been able to integrate that into kind of a more rigid business sort of context?  
**[0:41:27-0:41:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:41:27):**  Sure.  
**[0:41:28-0:41:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:41:28):**  So I think diversifying the income stream is really important, especially for people  
**[0:41:32-0:41:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:41:32):**  who are just starting out.  
**[0:41:34-0:41:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:41:34):**  And that's something that we've been doing for over a decade as really, we would show  
**[0:41:39-0:41:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:41:39):**  up to some of the early on farmer's markets with all kinds of things from vegetables to  
**[0:41:45-0:41:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:41:45):**  baked goods to art to fabric aprons to all kinds of different things.  
**[0:41:53-0:41:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:41:53):**  So we've always had that mentality of diversifying the income stream.  
**[0:41:56-0:42:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:41:56):**  And for us, it's exciting and fresh and you don't have to focus on one thing over and  
**[0:42:01-0:42:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:42:01):**  over.  
**[0:42:02-0:42:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:42:02):**  And so for us it works.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:42:04):**  And when we harvest for farmer's markets, it's exciting.  
**[0:42:08-0:42:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:42:08):**  And we go from maybe 20 pounds of salad mix to two bucket fulls of sugar snap peas.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:42:16):**  And then we make edible flower bouquets or harvest some medicinal bouquets or then go  
**[0:42:23-0:42:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:42:23):**  over to the chamomile patch and gather a bunch of chamomile flowers to make tea.  
**[0:42:29-0:42:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:42:29):**  So we love it.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:42:31):**  I think the polyculture is really important, not only for human health, but environmental  
**[0:42:37-0:42:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:42:37):**  health.  
**[0:42:38-0:42:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:42:38):**  And I think that the more and more we get out of the monoculture mentality and into  
**[0:42:42-0:42:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:42:42):**  polycultures, the more abundance there'll be.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:42:46):**  And yes, while it does minimize some efficiencies, it maximizes joy.  
**[0:42:53-0:42:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:42:53):**  So I would say.  
**[0:42:54-0:42:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:42:54):**  That's a very significant factor, not to be forgotten.  
**[0:42:57-0:42:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:42:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:58-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:42:58):**  If you're not having fun with it, how long are you actually going to stick with the practice?  
**[0:43:01-0:43:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:43:01):**  And definitely working with living systems like this, it's an investment in a much longer  
**[0:43:07-0:43:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:43:07):**  system.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:43:08):**  And a lot of us are used to going to the grocery store or even if there are sort of better  
**[0:43:13-0:43:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:43:13):**  practices going and getting things from a CSA, it doesn't require a huge time investment.  
**[0:43:18-0:43:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:43:18):**  And if you're going to go all the way to the point of producing your own food, it's worth  
**[0:43:22-0:43:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:43:22):**  making the process enjoyable.  
**[0:43:24-0:43:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:43:24):**  And on that note, if they're like for the people out there listening and aspiring to  
**[0:43:29-0:43:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:43:29):**  start growing their own food, what are some of the most important tools and resources  
**[0:43:34-0:43:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:43:34):**  that you would recommend that they invest in first?  
**[0:43:38-0:43:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:43:38):**  Sure.  
**[0:43:39-0:43:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:43:39):**  So I would say start with soil.  
**[0:43:42-0:43:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:43:42):**  Here in St. Louis, we're about 45 minutes to an hour from St. Louis.  
**[0:43:47-0:43:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:43:47):**  And there's a company called St. Louis Compost where you can get a truckload of fresh new  
**[0:43:52-0:43:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:43:52):**  compost, half compost, half topsoil blends, certified weed free.  
**[0:43:58-0:44:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:43:58):**  So there's no weed seedlings that could germinate.  
**[0:44:01-0:44:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:44:01):**  And just get new soil brought in.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:44:03):**  You can get a truckload for about $35 or you can get it delivered by the cubic square foot  
**[0:44:09-0:44:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:44:09):**  for a higher rate, of course.  
**[0:44:11-0:44:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:44:11):**  But I think it's well worth it.  
**[0:44:13-0:44:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:44:13):**  And then in terms of tools, having a broad fork is a really good idea or a digging fork  
**[0:44:20-0:44:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:44:20):**  just to loosen up the soil.  
**[0:44:22-0:44:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:44:22):**  Having a hard rake and a hula-ho are some tools that we use on a regular basis and then  
**[0:44:28-0:44:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:44:28):**  a nice hand trowel to do hand transplanting.  
**[0:44:32-0:44:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:44:32):**  And then just investing in some seed flats or building your own with wood, just wooden  
**[0:44:36-0:44:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:44:36):**  boxes filled with a potting soil mix.  
**[0:44:42-0:44:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:44:42):**  So the downfall of the St. Louis Compost is that they don't have a germination mix, so  
**[0:44:47-0:44:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:44:47):**  we have to buy that elsewhere.  
**[0:44:49-0:44:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:44:49):**  But it really is important if you're starting your own seeds to get a really nice quality  
**[0:44:53-0:44:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:44:53):**  germination mix.  
**[0:44:55-0:44:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:44:55):**  And we've had the most luck with Vermont compost.  
**[0:44:59-0:45:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:44:59):**  But again, that's a hefty price and you have to pay for shipping and it's coming all the  
**[0:45:04-0:45:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:45:04):**  way for Vermont.  
**[0:45:05-0:45:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:45:05):**  So lately we've been just getting bags at a time of organic potting soil from the local  
**[0:45:11-0:45:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:45:11):**  farm and feed store, which someday we'd like to create our own germination mix.  
**[0:45:17-0:45:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:45:17):**  So I would say focus on soil, get good quality seeds from a nice supplier like Baker Creek  
**[0:45:24-0:45:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:45:24):**  or Southern Seed Exposure, seeds of change, strictly medicinals.  
**[0:45:31-0:45:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:45:31):**  We go through a lot of Johnny's seeds and we also do a lot of saving of our own seeds.  
**[0:45:39-0:45:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:45:39):**  So I would focus highly on saving your own seeds.  
**[0:45:43-0:45:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:45:43):**  It's really important.  
**[0:45:44-0:45:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:45:44):**  One of my heroes is Vandana Shiva and she focuses a lot on seed sovereignty.  
**[0:45:50-0:45:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:45:50):**  Yeah, I agree.  
**[0:45:53-0:45:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:45:53):**  Getting seeds is one of those key things, not only to cutting down the cost, because  
**[0:45:57-0:46:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:45:57):**  if you are getting heirloom and organic seeds, they can get expensive.  
**[0:46:01-0:46:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:46:01):**  But also because if you start to cultivate the practice over time, you're going to slowly  
**[0:46:06-0:46:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:46:06):**  sort of alter the genetics of the plants that you're growing to become more stable and grow  
**[0:46:12-0:46:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:46:12):**  better in the context in which you're growing them.  
**[0:46:15-0:46:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:46:15):**  They'll become easier and more pest resistant over time.  
**[0:46:18-0:46:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:46:18):**  Definitely.  
**[0:46:19-0:46:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:46:19):**  And it's such a fun process, especially to do with children.  
**[0:46:22-0:46:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:46:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:46:23):**  So as we wrap up here, before I let you go, could you tell our listeners how they can  
**[0:46:27-0:46:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:46:27):**  get in touch with you, find some of your other resources and books and leave them with sort  
**[0:46:33-0:46:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:46:33):**  of a message of where they can find or get involved with what you're doing?  
**[0:46:38-0:46:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:46:38):**  Sure.  
**[0:46:39-0:46:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:46:39):**  So our business is called Flourish and you can find us at growcreateinspire.com.  
**[0:46:46-0:46:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:46:46):**  And we're also on social media at growcreateinspire.  
**[0:46:49-0:46:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:46:49):**  We're not yet able to transition to the Flourish social media yet, because all of our content  
**[0:46:56-0:46:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:46:56):**  is still on the Grow Create Inspire site.  
**[0:46:59-0:47:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:46:59):**  But Instagram at growcreateinspire, the books are titled Grow Create Inspire, Worms at Work,  
**[0:47:06-0:47:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:47:06):**  and soon to be released in January of 2020 is Your Edible Yard.  
**[0:47:13-0:47:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:47:13):**  And they're all published by New Society Publishers, which prints on 100% post-consumer  
**[0:47:19-0:47:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:47:19):**  waste.  
**[0:47:20-0:47:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:47:20):**  So that's a really wonderful publisher that does amazing ecological work.  
**[0:47:27-0:47:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:47:27):**  And you can find some of our permaculture design courses on growcreateinspire.com.  
**[0:47:32-0:47:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:47:32):**  I also post a lot of things to the Grow Create Inspire Facebook page, as well as gardening  
**[0:47:38-0:47:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:47:38):**  tips, weekly recipes.  
**[0:47:40-0:47:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:47:40):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:42-0:47:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:47:42):**  And I think I've contributed to publications such as Permaculture Magazine, Taproot Magazine.  
**[0:47:49-0:47:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:47:49):**  I speak at all of the Mother Earth News conferences, maybe not all of them, but several throughout  
**[0:47:55-0:47:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:47:55):**  the year.  
**[0:47:56-0:48:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:47:56):**  This weekend I'm gearing up to be a presenter at the Midwest Women's Herbal Conference.  
**[0:48:01-0:48:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:48:01):**  And then also I'm one of the co-teachers on the Permaculture Women's Guild through that  
**[0:48:08-0:48:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:48:08):**  permaculture organization.  
**[0:48:09-0:48:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:48:09):**  So kind of all over the place and just really excited to be a part of your podcast.  
**[0:48:15-0:48:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:48:15):**  I'm an absolute fan of your work, so I really appreciate this opportunity.  
**[0:48:20-0:48:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:48:20):**  Well, thanks so much, Krista.  
**[0:48:22-0:48:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:48:22):**  I appreciate that.  
**[0:48:23-0:48:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:48:23):**  And for those of you listening, if this woman with all the things that she's doing and how  
**[0:48:28-0:48:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:48:28):**  incredibly productive and prolific in creation she is can still manage to grow her own food,  
**[0:48:33-0:48:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:48:33):**  you should definitely be able to do it too.  
**[0:48:35-0:48:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:48:35):**  So I really recommend, and I'll put all the links to your books and to all of those ways  
**[0:48:39-0:48:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:48:39):**  of getting in touch with you to the show notes on this podcast.  
**[0:48:42-0:48:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:48:42):**  And Krista, it was an absolute pleasure connecting with you.  
**[0:48:45-0:48:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:48:45):**  I hope we can stay in touch and maybe do a follow up again in the future.  
**[0:48:48-0:48:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:48:48):**  Oh, that sounds lovely.  
**[0:48:49-0:48:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:48:49):**  And if you're ever in the Midwest, just you're welcome anytime.  
**[0:48:53-0:48:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-crystal-stevens/#t=0:48:53):**  Oh man, I will definitely grab that opportunity if I can find my way over to that area.

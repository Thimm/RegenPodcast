### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 24 May 2019 18:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:00:13):**  Here we dive deep into the diverse worlds of regenerative living, permaculture, and  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:00:17):**  natural building as we aspire to help you reach your highest potential for yourself,  
**[0:00:22-0:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:00:22):**  for your community, and for this beautiful planet that we share.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:00:25):**  As always, I'm your host Oliver Gaucher, and I'm thrilled to guide you through this  
**[0:00:29-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:00:29):**  week's episode, so let's jump right in.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:00:31):**  News Society Publishers' books are so green, you could eat them!  
**[0:00:44-0:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:00:44):**  We print all our books in North America, never overseas, on 100% post-consumer recycled paper,  
**[0:00:50-0:00:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:00:50):**  we've been a carbon neutral company since 2006, our employees are shareholders, and  
**[0:00:56-0:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:00:56):**  we are a certified B Corporation.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:00:59):**  At News Society, we care deeply about what we publish, but also about how we do business.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:01:05):**  Find out more at newsociety.com.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:01:06):**  Alright everybody, before I get started with today's episode, I wanted to let you know  
**[0:01:13-0:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:01:13):**  about a new project that I've just launched.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:01:16):**  Now after years of highlighting and promoting the knowledge, wisdom, and projects of innovators  
**[0:01:20-0:01:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:01:20):**  and leaders in regenerative living through this podcast, I've realized that this audio  
**[0:01:24-0:01:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:01:24):**  format can only ever reach so many people.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:01:27):**  There are so many others out there who engage more with other forms of learning.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:01:31):**  That's why I've started the Abundant Edge YouTube channel.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:01:34):**  Now that I'm back on the road and visiting regenerative and sustainable projects in my  
**[0:01:38-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:01:38):**  travels, I'll be profiling the people and organizations that are making a real impact  
**[0:01:42-0:01:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:01:42):**  on their environments and their communities.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:01:45):**  My goal is to show as many people as I can reach that you don't have to have a lot  
**[0:01:48-0:01:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:01:48):**  of money, access to a ton of resources, or have a fancy education under your belt to  
**[0:01:53-0:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:01:53):**  make a real difference in this world and create change.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:01:56):**  My first mini-documentary highlights the unbelievable achievements of a small community called Quixa  
**[0:02:01-0:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:02:01):**  Ya in the highlands of Guatemala.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:02:04):**  More than 30 years ago, the land where the village is located was owned by a plantation  
**[0:02:07-0:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:02:07):**  owner who kept the ecosystem under monoculture cultivation and exploited the local people  
**[0:02:12-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:02:12):**  who worked for slave wages on the farm.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:02:15):**  After the owner defaulted on his loans, the bank repossessed the land and offered it back  
**[0:02:19-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:02:19):**  to the local workers as payment for the wages owed to them.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:02:22):**  The villagers then redistributed their terrain among the original 80 families who took back  
**[0:02:27-0:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:02:27):**  control of the plantation and divided it equally between themselves so they might care for  
**[0:02:31-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:02:31):**  it and create a better life for their families.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:02:34):**  Now decades later, the descendants of these pioneers have helped transform the land into  
**[0:02:38-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:02:38):**  a profound abundance which you'll see in the documentary.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:02:42):**  If you want to see the rest, you'll have to check it out for yourself.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:02:44):**  You can find it really easily just by typing in Abundant Edge into the YouTube search bar.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:02:49):**  Be sure to keep an eye out for more short films highlighting the projects that I visit  
**[0:02:53-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:02:53):**  as I travel through Mexico and beyond.  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:02:55):**  I'll also be releasing tutorials on everything from design theory to building and gardening  
**[0:02:59-0:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:02:59):**  techniques in the upcoming months.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:03:01):**  I really hope that this will become a resource that, like the podcasts, helps to inspire  
**[0:03:06-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:03:06):**  you to live your highest potential by living regeneratively.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:03:11):**  Today I'll be kicking off another month dedicated to an important topic in regenerative living.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:03:16):**  For a long time now, our food system has been a primary indicator for so many markers of  
**[0:03:20-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:03:20):**  health in our society.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:03:22):**  From the way that our food is produced, what kinds of food we eat, how we cook, how it  
**[0:03:27-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:03:27):**  affects our health, and even our ethics as consumers.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:03:30):**  Now for the next few weeks I'll be taking a look at our food system from a variety of  
**[0:03:34-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:03:34):**  different viewpoints and analysis in order to shed light on some of the lesser known  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:03:38):**  factors that influence how we eat and how our dietary choices shape the food industry  
**[0:03:43-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:03:43):**  at large.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:03:44):**  To kick off this series I spoke with John Steinman, author of the new book Grocery Store,  
**[0:03:49-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:03:49):**  The Promise of Food Co-ops in the Age of Grocery Giants.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:03:53):**  Now John has studied and worked with Everything About Food for more than 20 years.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:03:57):**  He formally produced and hosted a popular podcast called Deconstructing Dinner and was  
**[0:04:02-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:04:02):**  a writer and host for a web series by the same name.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:04:05):**  He also now curates the annual Deconstructing Dinner Film Festival of compelling food documentaries.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:04:12):**  John was also an elected director from 2006 to 2016 of the Kootenay Co-op, Canada's largest  
**[0:04:18-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:04:18):**  independent retail consumer food co-op, serving as board president from 2014 to 2016.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:04:25):**  Now I consider myself fairly well informed about the food industry from personal research  
**[0:04:29-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:04:29):**  and the fact that in the last decade I've worked directly in many branches of the industry  
**[0:04:33-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:04:33):**  from refrigerated shipping, industrial farms, organic farms, fish processing, many different  
**[0:04:39-0:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:04:39):**  roles in restaurants, and even the permaculture farm that many of you have heard me talk about  
**[0:04:43-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:04:43):**  for over a year now.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:04:44):**  But I never knew so much about the influence that the giant grocery chains and supermarkets  
**[0:04:48-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:04:48):**  have on every aspect of our food from how it's grown all the way till it gets to our  
**[0:04:53-0:04:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:04:53):**  plates.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:04:54):**  Now this is a very eye-opening look not only at the broken aspects of the food industry  
**[0:04:58-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:04:58):**  but the very tangible and accessible solutions that co-op grocery stores can be.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:05:02):**  Not only for getting access to better food and transforming the way the industry is incentivized  
**[0:05:06-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:05:06):**  to operate, but also for the positive impact that co-ops can have on our communities and  
**[0:05:11-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:05:11):**  local economies.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:05:13):**  We also talk about solutions for access to high quality food for low income neighborhoods  
**[0:05:17-0:05:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:05:17):**  and much more.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:05:18):**  So before I give it all away, I'll hand things over now to John.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:05:22):**  Hey John, thank you so much for taking the time to be with us here today.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:05:26):**  How are you doing?  
**[0:05:27-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:05:27):**  Doing really well, yeah.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:05:28):**  Thanks Oliver.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:05:29):**  Enjoying the spring coming in here.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:05:32):**  So where are you calling in from?  
**[0:05:33-0:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:05:33):**  Sorry, I didn't even check in before.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:05:35):**  Yeah, well I'm in Nelson, British Columbia.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:05:38):**  So that's pretty much as far away from any major city that you can find in southern British  
**[0:05:46-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:05:46):**  Columbia.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:05:47):**  So I'm about eight hours east of Vancouver, about seven hours west of Calgary, not too  
**[0:05:51-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:05:51):**  far north of the US border.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:05:54):**  Ah, gotcha.  
**[0:05:55-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:05:55):**  Yeah, see I haven't actually been through that area, though I have family in Vancouver  
**[0:06:00-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:06:00):**  and the Calgary area.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:06:02):**  But we've had volunteers here at the farm from there and from everything I've heard  
**[0:06:06-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:06:06):**  it's gorgeous.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:06:07):**  Yeah, it's what drew me out here in the first place.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:06:10):**  You know, I grew up in Ontario and came out here about 13, 14 years ago now.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:06:16):**  And you know, it's a small place.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:06:18):**  There's about 10,000 people in the city, maybe another 10,000 in the surrounding area.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:06:22):**  But you know, people come here from all over Canada, all over the United States and a few  
**[0:06:27-0:06:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:06:27):**  other places from around the world.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:06:29):**  And so there's a bit of a cosmopolitan feel in a small community.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:06:33):**  Marvelous.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:06:34):**  Well, hey, look, I've got a ton of questions that I would really love to ask you about  
**[0:06:37-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:06:37):**  your new book, Grocery Store.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:06:40):**  And there's just so much to unpack from the topics here.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:06:43):**  So what do you say we just jump into the questions?  
**[0:06:45-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:06:45):**  Let's jump into the questions.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:06:46):**  But hey, let me first tell you that the title, it's funny, you know, the title of the book  
**[0:06:52-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:06:52):**  is Grocery Story.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:06:54):**  And it's been this interesting journey so far in this early stage of having published  
**[0:06:59-0:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:06:59):**  or just about to publish a book.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:07:02):**  You know, the name is Grocery Story.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:07:04):**  And it's interesting how many people see Grocery Store and certainly online as well.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:07:10):**  Google wants to autocorrect every time you type in grocery story, it wants to autocorrect  
**[0:07:15-0:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:07:15):**  at the grocery store.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:07:17):**  So I'm so glad you corrected me because like I did notice that when I was reading through  
**[0:07:21-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:07:21):**  it and it just slipped my mind as I was saying it.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:07:23):**  I'm kind of tired today.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:07:24):**  So thank you for clarifying.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:07:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:07:27):**  You know, I think it's going to be something I'll be doing for the next year.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:07:30):**  Well, let's see if we can justify that screw up and redeem myself later on.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:07:36):**  How about we start by getting a little bit of your background and tell me how you became  
**[0:07:40-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:07:40):**  interested in defining food systems and how the story of grocery chains and the expansion  
**[0:07:48-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:07:48):**  of their monopoly has really had an impact on the food system that we interact with.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:07:54):**  Yeah, it's a good question.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:07:56):**  And you know, in the book, I share quite a bit of my personal journey into this.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:08:01):**  And I think I felt that I wanted to share a bit of that personal story because by and  
**[0:08:07-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:08:07):**  large there isn't a lot written about grocery stores, which is fascinating.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:08:12):**  You know, there was a book that came out a couple of years ago that does dive deep into  
**[0:08:17-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:08:17):**  the grocery store sector.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:08:19):**  But beyond that one title, there wasn't much and isn't much out there.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:08:23):**  And so I felt compelled to share a little bit of my personal story because for me, I  
**[0:08:28-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:08:28):**  have been a food journalist for the better part of the past 15 years.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:08:33):**  You know, I started writing restaurant reviews and diving a bit more into the sort of culinary  
**[0:08:39-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:08:39):**  side of things.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:08:40):**  And it was really my appreciation of food that kind of drew me into looking, as you  
**[0:08:45-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:08:45):**  say, more into what might be considered food systems, which I imagine most of your listeners  
**[0:08:50-0:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:08:50):**  are familiar with, which is really all of the parts making up, getting food from the  
**[0:08:56-0:09:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:08:56):**  farm, even all the inputs that go into the farm, getting food from the farm to our kitchens.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:09:02):**  And all of those moving parts in between would be considered the food system.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:09:05):**  And my first foray beyond just eating and appreciating food, my first kind of entry  
**[0:09:11-0:09:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:09:11):**  into that was studying at the University of Guelph for four years where I studied restaurant  
**[0:09:16-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:09:16):**  and hotel management.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:09:18):**  And it was there I developed this appreciation for food, but it was also there where I started  
**[0:09:23-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:09:23):**  to really learn how disconnected the various parts of the food system were from one another.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:09:28):**  So here I was learning how to manage a restaurant.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:09:34):**  And yet all of the pieces beyond the walls of that restaurant weren't really being shown  
**[0:09:40-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:09:40):**  to me, in particular, where all the food was coming from.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:09:44):**  And it was a fascinating thing that it took me years to eventually realize how disconnected  
**[0:09:50-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:09:50):**  this was, because not only was I learning this at the University of Guelph, but I was  
**[0:09:54-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:09:54):**  doing it right beside the largest agricultural school in the entire country and all of Canada.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:10:01):**  And so when I left university after those first four years, that really began this journey  
**[0:10:06-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:10:06):**  of trying to learn more about, you know, what are all these pieces that make up the food  
**[0:10:11-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:10:11):**  system?  
**[0:10:13-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:10:13):**  And in particular, I wanted to learn why is it the food that I started to appreciate the  
**[0:10:19-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:10:19):**  most, which was the most local, freshest food possible?  
**[0:10:23-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:10:23):**  Why was it so difficult to find that food at grocery stores near my home?  
**[0:10:28-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:10:28):**  And so that was back in 2004, where I really started to ask those questions.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:10:34):**  A couple years before really this kind of real strong interest in local food first began.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:10:40):**  And it took many years before I really started to appreciate just how important the grocery  
**[0:10:46-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:10:46):**  store piece of the food system is, you know, I spent many years hosting a radio show and  
**[0:10:52-0:10:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:10:52):**  podcast like yours.  
**[0:10:54-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:10:54):**  I spent, you know, 40 hours a week researching everything about the food system.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:11:00):**  And it took me many years to finally realize, wait a minute, you know, there's this one  
**[0:11:04-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:11:04):**  piece within the food system that doesn't really get a lot of attention, you know, there's  
**[0:11:08-0:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:11:08):**  a lot of attention going into farmers markets, a lot of attention going into growing our  
**[0:11:11-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:11:11):**  own food, cultivating, you know, that relationship directly with with growing food.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:11:17):**  And yet, this one very penetrating strand of the food system where, you know, by and  
**[0:11:24-0:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:11:24):**  large, and I've sort of, you know, as I say in the book, calculated 94% of all food purchases  
**[0:11:30-0:11:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:11:30):**  are going through grocery stores, or some form of food retailer, you know, why is it  
**[0:11:36-0:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:11:36):**  this very penetrating strand of the food system hasn't received a lot of attention.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:11:40):**  And so, you know, that in a nutshell is sort of the journey I took to finally get there.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:11:47):**  That is fascinating, because so many people have come from different directions and points  
**[0:11:51-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:11:51):**  of interest or study to find a relationship and how they interact with their food system.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:11:57):**  And it's great to hear from yours as well.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:12:00):**  But let's focus for a second on the rise of the grocery giants.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:12:04):**  And you go into great detail in this in your book, and sort of how their business models  
**[0:12:08-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:12:08):**  shaped the way that we produce, distribute, buy and consume our food, because it really  
**[0:12:14-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:12:14):**  is a very overarching influence on every level of this industry.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:12:21):**  It is.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:12:22):**  And, you know, it, I think the best entry point into that, specifically into this, you  
**[0:12:29-0:12:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:12:29):**  know, question, well, how does the grocery sector shape the food system?  
**[0:12:34-0:12:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:12:34):**  You know, in one example that I use in the book, is really the actual shape and structure  
**[0:12:39-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:12:39):**  and flavor of our food is very much determined by the demands that grocery stores place upon  
**[0:12:46-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:12:46):**  the food system.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:12:47):**  So, you know, it, in many ways, we as eaters, as consumers, we do help dictate, you know,  
**[0:12:54-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:12:54):**  what ends up being grown and produced.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:12:57):**  But if there's only so many options available to us, whether it's the options that are on  
**[0:13:02-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:13:02):**  the shelf of the store, when we walk into the store, like there's three or four types  
**[0:13:06-0:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:13:06):**  of tomatoes, or even just two or three options, grocery stores near our home, we're not really  
**[0:13:13-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:13:13):**  all that powerful, I guess you could say in terms of determining the food system.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:13:18):**  It's really the stores that are providing the choices to us that are really, as I see  
**[0:13:23-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:13:23):**  it, dictating what's grown and how it's grown.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:13:25):**  And so, you know, I speak of the shape of the food.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:13:29):**  So that is, in and of itself, a really good example where we can walk into a grocery store  
**[0:13:34-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:13:34):**  and by and large, the conventional grocery stores, particularly that we walk into, you  
**[0:13:38-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:13:38):**  know, you can imagine standing in front of the case or shelf of tomatoes, and usually  
**[0:13:44-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:13:44):**  they all pretty much look the exact same.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:13:46):**  And of course, a lot of that has to do with being able to package those in the right size  
**[0:13:52-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:13:52):**  boxes for that tomato to be able to be picked when it's green, often, if it's the case of  
**[0:13:57-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:13:57):**  a field tomato where they're being picked green, and then they get ripened in these  
**[0:14:02-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:14:02):**  rooms where ethylene gas is piped into the room.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:14:06):**  And then eventually they get put onto a truck and within a few days, they'll be anywhere  
**[0:14:09-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:14:09):**  in North America.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:14:11):**  In order for that tomato to be that perfect texture, that perfect firmness so that it  
**[0:14:18-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:14:18):**  can last in the trucks in the right temperatures, you know, it led to this very intentional  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:14:28):**  breeding program among, you know, many of the breeding programs you might find at universities  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:14:33):**  or within some of the companies producing it themselves, producing the seeds.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:14:38):**  It led to this very notable intention over the past 50, 60 years to grow a tomato to  
**[0:14:47-0:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:14:47):**  serve that interest.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:14:49):**  And so, you know, this all really begins in the grocery store.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:14:53):**  So the grocery store is making that call and saying, you know, here's the tomato we want  
**[0:14:57-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:14:57):**  on the shelf.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:14:58):**  And then you can imagine all those pieces that extend from that all the way down to  
**[0:15:02-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:15:02):**  the farm, into the breeding programs and into the seed itself, it has dictated the types  
**[0:15:08-0:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:15:08):**  of food that's available to us.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:15:10):**  And you know, from there, we have run the risk, and certainly this has been the case  
**[0:15:17-0:15:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:15:17):**  of losing access to genetic diversity, losing access to really the diversity of flavor that  
**[0:15:24-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:15:24):**  I imagine all of your listeners are familiar with when it comes to, you know, more of those  
**[0:15:29-0:15:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:15:29):**  garden varieties of tomatoes, for example, that we can be growing, or that are growing  
**[0:15:34-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:15:34):**  more likely on a smaller scale on smaller farms, or in, you know, permaculture environments  
**[0:15:41-0:15:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:15:41):**  as well.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:15:42):**  So, you know, that's just one example of the grocery stores literally shaping the food  
**[0:15:47-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:15:47):**  that we eat right from the get go.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:15:50):**  And then beyond that, you know, is less maybe tangible is the way in which having only a  
**[0:15:56-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:15:56):**  handful of grocery stores who are essentially that go between the farm and the eater, when  
**[0:16:03-0:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:16:03):**  you have only a handful of grocery stores in between the two, the farm and the eater,  
**[0:16:09-0:16:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:16:09):**  they pretty much are dictating what comes through in a way that that gate, you know,  
**[0:16:14-0:16:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:16:14):**  I call the grocery giant gatekeepers, and they are determining, you know, how that food  
**[0:16:21-0:16:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:16:21):**  is going to get to you and what food is going to get.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:16:24):**  And so you know, when I talk about the power of the grocery giants to really dictate the  
**[0:16:29-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:16:29):**  food system, a lot of it has to do with this visual that we can imagine of a bottleneck,  
**[0:16:35-0:16:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:16:35):**  where, you know, you have millions of farmers around the world, and you have a billion,  
**[0:16:41-0:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:16:41):**  seven plus billion eaters.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:16:44):**  And then, by and large, anywhere where we live, we usually only have up to maybe five  
**[0:16:50-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:16:50):**  different grocery chains, determining what food is available to us.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:16:56):**  And so all of the food goes through this bottleneck.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:17:00):**  And so this is the bottleneck I speak of in the book.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:17:04):**  Now you mentioned how these industries have become increasingly consolidated, have really  
**[0:17:10-0:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:17:10):**  become a monopoly in many cases, to the point where I think you said there's only about  
**[0:17:15-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:17:15):**  five real grocery chains, and many subsidiaries within that.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:17:20):**  And this is having an increasing impact, especially on consumers.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:17:27):**  How have you seen sort of the progression of these monopolies affecting consumers directly?  
**[0:17:34-0:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:17:34):**  Well, you know, I think one example, I walked into my one of the chain grocers here where  
**[0:17:46-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:17:46):**  I live in Nelson recently.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:17:49):**  And one of the things that we're starting to see on the shelves of many of the dominant  
**[0:17:54-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:17:54):**  chains is this interest in local food.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:17:57):**  And it's something that is, you know, close to my heart, it's something that I care about,  
**[0:18:01-0:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:18:01):**  because it's the way I choose to eat.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:18:03):**  You know, I don't grow a large amount of my food, I have a small garden, I do rely on  
**[0:18:08-0:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:18:08):**  either farmers markets or grocery stores.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:18:10):**  And what's really important to me is the ability for me to be able to access local food as  
**[0:18:17-0:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:18:17):**  easily as I possibly can, and to support my neighbors and people I know.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:18:21):**  And so, you know, that's something that's important to me.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:18:24):**  So you know, when I hear that the dominant chains are starting to invite local food onto  
**[0:18:29-0:18:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:18:29):**  their shelves, as many of them are now trying to do, you know, that's something that generally  
**[0:18:34-0:18:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:18:34):**  we'd want to celebrate, because that's that many more options for consumers to access  
**[0:18:41-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:18:41):**  local food.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:18:42):**  And so it's heartening, though, to walk into a chain retailer, as I did not too long ago,  
**[0:18:48-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:18:48):**  and to see that instead of there being local food on the shelf that says local food, there's  
**[0:18:53-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:18:53):**  in fact food from places that, you know, aren't anywhere near where I live.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:18:57):**  And so, in some cases, this is being done within, you know, the legal definition of  
**[0:19:04-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:19:04):**  local, which in where I live in British Columbia, is a very widespread definition.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:19:09):**  So to call something local in my community, it can come from anywhere within the province.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:19:14):**  And British Columbia is massive, it's larger than most countries.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:19:18):**  So you can have food coming from, you know, 650 700 miles away, and still call it local.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:19:27):**  So that's, you know, some of the local food that's found on our chain grocers.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:19:30):**  In other cases, you know, I found food that was coming from across the provincial lines  
**[0:19:37-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:19:37):**  from as far away as Alberta, which legally is actually not allowed to be called local  
**[0:19:41-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:19:41):**  food.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:19:42):**  And yet one of our chain grocers here is calling it local food.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:19:47):**  So you know, this is something that to kind of come back to your question, is challenging  
**[0:19:52-0:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:19:52):**  the availability of local food in our communities, because it's starting to water down this.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:20:00):**  It's watering down the ability for actual local producers to market their product as  
**[0:20:05-0:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:20:05):**  local and gain value from that definition of local.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:20:10):**  So if all the chains are starting to water down local, so that local means really the  
**[0:20:13-0:20:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:20:13):**  entire western portion of Canada, which is very much what what the chains out here are  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:20:19):**  and you know, I can say I can, I found many examples of this in the United States as well,  
**[0:20:24-0:20:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:20:24):**  or in Eastern Canada, then we start to lose value for those small producers who really  
**[0:20:29-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:20:29):**  rely on their ability to market themselves as being local.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:20:34):**  So you know, the struggle and challenge of producing local food is already on its own  
**[0:20:41-0:20:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:20:41):**  struggle.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:20:42):**  And it doesn't make it any easier when you have these chains that are starting to be  
**[0:20:47-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:20:47):**  value in the name local, but in order to really deliver it genuinely, there's a need from  
**[0:20:53-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:20:53):**  what I see for them to water it down.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:20:56):**  And so you have, you know, as is the subject of my book, the promise of food co-ops, so  
**[0:21:02-0:21:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:21:02):**  community owned grocery stores, who have genuinely generally been very transparent and integral  
**[0:21:09-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:21:09):**  and honest about, you know, local food being actually from within a small local bioregion.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:21:15):**  And so you have this also challenge now among our community owned grocery stores, to really  
**[0:21:21-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:21:21):**  to really ensure that the food that they rely on to differentiate themselves can be, you  
**[0:21:28-0:21:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:21:28):**  know, a viable business for small scale producers to be in.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:21:32):**  So this is, you know, one of the challenges right now, within the food system, and one  
**[0:21:36-0:21:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:21:36):**  of the ways in which these grocery stores, the chains, the grocery giants are shaping  
**[0:21:42-0:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:21:42):**  the food system.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:21:43):**  You know, I used the example earlier of the tomato, and there is now this example too  
**[0:21:48-0:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:21:48):**  of shaping the ability for local food systems to thrive.  
**[0:21:54-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:21:54):**  Yeah, see, this is fascinating because I remember when I first realized that many of these labels  
**[0:22:01-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:22:01):**  that are put on food products to attract us to buy them, especially to attract more ethical  
**[0:22:07-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:22:07):**  or conscious consumer things like all natural or local or, you know, even organic, depending  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:22:13):**  on where it is, is not protected by law the way many people would assume.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:22:18):**  And especially in cases of things like all natural, there's no standard like it doesn't  
**[0:22:24-0:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:22:24):**  have to comply to anything.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:22:26):**  It's mostly just a marketing ploy and it sounds good.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:22:29):**  And it really waters down the expectations or the standards for things that really are  
**[0:22:34-0:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:22:34):**  produced at a high quality and are handled with care along the journey.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:22:39):**  And like you said, it starts to discredit some of the legitimate products that consumers  
**[0:22:46-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:22:46):**  are looking for when they realize that there's not actually much meaning behind these labels.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:22:51):**  Well, and you know, everyone's familiar with how this happened as well with organic food,  
**[0:22:58-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:22:58):**  you know, where organic food was often for, you know, I think a long period of time, somewhat  
**[0:23:06-0:23:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:23:06):**  synonymous with food that was from your area.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:23:09):**  You know, generally, the organic food producers were able to just were simply market their  
**[0:23:16-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:23:16):**  product as organic in their local communities.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:23:20):**  Whereas now the same thing is happening where, you know, an organic carrot grown locally  
**[0:23:24-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:23:24):**  close to me here in Nelson, BC, is the same organic carrot that is grown somewhere in  
**[0:23:30-0:23:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:23:30):**  California, thousands of miles away.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:23:33):**  And so, you know, the same thing happened with organic, as you say, you know, natural  
**[0:23:38-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:23:38):**  is also not defined in any way whatsoever.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:23:43):**  You know, anything can be considered natural.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:23:45):**  And so, you know, this, for me, is what really drew my interest into writing this book was  
**[0:23:52-0:23:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:23:52):**  to, you know, was to was to take a breath in a way to take a breather and step back  
**[0:23:59-0:24:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:23:59):**  and say, Okay, well, wait a minute, you know, if the labels that we rely on to really help  
**[0:24:04-0:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:24:04):**  communicate, you know, the food that we're eating, if these labels that we rely on, are  
**[0:24:10-0:24:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:24:10):**  starting to not carry the meaning that we would hope them to carry, where else can we  
**[0:24:14-0:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:24:14):**  look to, to, to find trust in our experience of shopping for food because, you know, the  
**[0:24:21-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:24:21):**  last, I think the last thing any of us want is to go into our grocery stores or a farmers  
**[0:24:28-0:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:24:28):**  market, wherever it is, we're accessing food, the last thing we want is to feel like we're  
**[0:24:33-0:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:24:33):**  in some sort of battle or we're in some sort of conflict, or we have to somehow question  
**[0:24:38-0:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:24:38):**  everything we're buying.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:24:40):**  And I think to a degree, there is a role for eaters to be to scrutinize what we're buying  
**[0:24:46-0:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:24:46):**  to be critical of what we're buying is, but there's only so much we can we can handle,  
**[0:24:52-0:24:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:24:52):**  you know, we don't want to have to be the expert when we walk into the grocery store.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:24:56):**  I don't think that's really a real thing.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:25:00):**  Yeah, and I think generally, you know, especially if you're, you know, young parents and you  
**[0:25:05-0:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:25:05):**  have, you know, a child at home or two, three, four children at home, and you're, you're  
**[0:25:12-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:25:12):**  shopping for your family, really, like the last thing you have time for is doing the  
**[0:25:16-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:25:16):**  research and finding out where your food's coming from, finding out how it was grown.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:25:22):**  Like I say, I think there's a role for all of us to have a level of wisdom and knowledge  
**[0:25:29-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:25:29):**  when it comes to our food system.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:25:30):**  But it is such a dizzying array of detail, that it's nice to be able to rely either as  
**[0:25:37-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:25:37):**  as at one point was to rely on a certification label to rely on a name.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:25:43):**  And of course, as we've been talking about here, that isn't always something we can be  
**[0:25:48-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:25:48):**  100% certain of.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:25:51):**  So again, you know, I come back to, you know, what was it that drew my interest to write  
**[0:25:54-0:25:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:25:54):**  this book?  
**[0:25:55-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:25:55):**  Well, part of it was because it seems to me that one place that we should be able to place  
**[0:26:01-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:26:01):**  our trust in is the person selling us the food.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:26:05):**  And so in this case, you know, like I say, with 94% of food purchases coming from some  
**[0:26:10-0:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:26:10):**  form of food retailer, mostly, you know, your traditional grocery store, wholesale club  
**[0:26:15-0:26:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:26:15):**  or specialty food retailer, we should be able to place our trust in those people.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:26:20):**  And this is where the idea of, you know, community on grocery stores first began, food co-ops,  
**[0:26:27-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:26:27):**  where you know, rather than feel that rather than actually be disconnected from the owner  
**[0:26:33-0:26:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:26:33):**  of your store, who you then have to place trust in.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:26:36):**  So that might be, you know, someone who lives in your community who owns the grocery store  
**[0:26:39-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:26:39):**  or it's a chain retailer that has a head office in some far off city or some distant country,  
**[0:26:47-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:26:47):**  even, we can actually use the co-op model to become an owner of our grocery store.  
**[0:26:53-0:27:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:26:53):**  And so that's where, you know, this co-op movement has begun in many parts of the economy.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:27:00):**  Of course, I focus on grocery retail, but it's this interest in this desire to relieve  
**[0:27:09-0:27:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:27:09):**  ourselves of the challenge and the anxiety that can come from shopping for food, which  
**[0:27:17-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:27:17):**  is not to say all food co-ops are able to be 100% perfect in purchasing food with the  
**[0:27:27-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:27:27):**  fullest integrity possible.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:27:29):**  You know, co-ops, I think generally, though, are the most integral of all the grocery stores  
**[0:27:36-0:27:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:27:36):**  I've ever come across and the best thing is, is if you find that your grocery store, even  
**[0:27:42-0:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:27:42):**  if it is a food co-op is no longer being as integral as you expect it to be, you have  
**[0:27:47-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:27:47):**  the opportunity to exert, you know, this democratic rights within your store to vote for a board  
**[0:27:55-0:28:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:27:55):**  of directors that will then decide, you know, in most cases who the general manager of the  
**[0:28:00-0:28:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:28:00):**  store is and who's running the store.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:28:03):**  And so every member has that vote.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:28:05):**  So as a, as a member of a food co-op, you have the democratic right to vote usually  
**[0:28:10-0:28:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:28:10):**  once a year for your board of directors.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:28:12):**  And generally members of food co-ops also have significantly more power in offering  
**[0:28:20-0:28:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:28:20):**  either a complaint or coming forward with a suggestion and an idea.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:28:25):**  No vote.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:28:26):**  Those ideas are almost always responded to, they're heard.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:28:31):**  And the ways in which food co-ops respond to members is unheard of in any sector of  
**[0:28:39-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:28:39):**  the economy that I've certainly experienced as a consumer.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:28:42):**  You know, this is certainly, it's a very stark juxtaposition.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:28:47):**  And before we kind of unpack the structure of co-ops and all of the benefits, let's take  
**[0:28:52-0:28:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:28:52):**  a couple steps back for a second and talk about this rise of the regional food movement  
**[0:28:58-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:28:58):**  and how it has the potential to shift these monopolies and disturb the status quo of how  
**[0:29:06-0:29:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:29:06):**  our food is marketed and processed.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:29:09):**  Yeah, well, you know, so the, the regional food movement, the local food movement has  
**[0:29:16-0:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:29:16):**  already done that, I think in huge ways.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:29:21):**  You know, there's, there's both, I think a pro and a con to what's happened with organic.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:29:26):**  You know, you have vastly, these vast acreages now planted with organic food that 15, 20  
**[0:29:36-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:29:36):**  years ago, weren't.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:29:38):**  And you know, even if it is this sort of industrial form of organic, I think there's a lot to  
**[0:29:43-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:29:43):**  celebrate that those are acres that were at one point grown conventionally, and they're  
**[0:29:48-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:29:48):**  now being grown in this using organic methods.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:29:52):**  So there's that power and that's the power of the eaters, that's the power of consumers,  
**[0:29:57-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:29:57):**  that's the power of, you know, the organic food movement to have done that.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:30:00):**  And the same, I think we've seen with local regional food is this power to shift what's  
**[0:30:10-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:30:10):**  already happened within, as I mentioned earlier, the conventional chains to start to pay attention  
**[0:30:15-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:30:15):**  to this.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:30:16):**  You know, it was just announced that IGA, which is this like large network of independently  
**[0:30:21-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:30:21):**  owned grocery stores.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:30:23):**  You know, they are now offering branding to all of their stores to begin branding what  
**[0:30:30-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:30:30):**  hopefully is genuinely local in their stores as being local.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:30:34):**  So this is something that emerged out of the local food movement where you have pretty  
**[0:30:40-0:30:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:30:40):**  much every major chain on the continent starting to pay attention to this and starting to,  
**[0:30:47-0:30:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:30:47):**  whether genuinely or not, hopefully mostly genuinely offer these products on the shelves.  
**[0:30:53-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:30:53):**  And so that, as I see it, has grown out of all of our interest in farmers markets, in  
**[0:31:01-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:31:01):**  growing our own food, in developing and supporting existing infrastructure within local food  
**[0:31:07-0:31:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:31:07):**  systems.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:31:09):**  You know, so really food co-ops have been a part of that, farmers markets have been  
**[0:31:13-0:31:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:31:13):**  a part of that, CSAs have been a part of that.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:31:15):**  It is this entire network of people who are trying to preserve and develop and grow our  
**[0:31:23-0:31:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:31:23):**  local food systems that I think is trickling up and reshaping the dominant food system  
**[0:31:31-0:31:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:31:31):**  and starting to, and I think it will reflect itself and come back in and I think to some  
**[0:31:39-0:31:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:31:39):**  degrees even though, as I say earlier, I think there's a threat of that challenging local  
**[0:31:46-0:31:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:31:46):**  food systems, I think there will also be some benefits from that where it will start to  
**[0:31:50-0:31:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:31:50):**  make more economical sense to be developing and growing local food based businesses because  
**[0:31:58-0:32:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:31:58):**  by and large generally the population of eaters is that much more willing and supportive of  
**[0:32:04-0:32:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:32:04):**  that type of food production.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:32:06):**  And I think one of the things that you said earlier that really brings it home is the  
**[0:32:11-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:32:11):**  emphasis of network and how each one of these pieces individually from co-ops to CSA models  
**[0:32:20-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:32:20):**  to various aspects of the regional food movement, they only have a certain amount of power in  
**[0:32:27-0:32:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:32:27):**  and of themselves, but when they start to work together and collaborate, they really  
**[0:32:31-0:32:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:32:31):**  form, like you said, a network that has a lot more buying power, has a lot more effect  
**[0:32:36-0:32:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:32:36):**  on the consumer and can actually shift the direction that even these large monopolized  
**[0:32:41-0:32:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:32:41):**  grocery store chains are moving in and create awareness and respect for the fact that consumers  
**[0:32:48-0:32:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:32:48):**  increasingly are looking for oversight and quality assurance from the things that they  
**[0:32:55-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:32:55):**  buy and consume.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:32:57):**  Yeah, and I think it's the need for having that community or network of interests within  
**[0:33:07-0:33:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:33:07):**  a local food system that I don't get the sense that the chains will ever be able to truly  
**[0:33:14-0:33:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:33:14):**  be integrated within.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:33:19):**  The model that they operate on, the way in which they compete with one another, I don't  
**[0:33:24-0:33:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:33:24):**  think allows for enough room for them to truly be integrated into our local food systems.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:33:31):**  As much as we'd love to put our attention into regulating or legislating or just simply  
**[0:33:37-0:33:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:33:37):**  demanding that chains carry more products from local producers, because obviously in  
**[0:33:43-0:33:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:33:43):**  many places there isn't any other option than chain grocers or farmers markets, but of course  
**[0:33:49-0:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:33:49):**  farmers markets are maybe only once a week in our communities or in our neighborhoods.  
**[0:33:55-0:34:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:33:55):**  Grocery stores, regardless of who owns them, have a responsibility in our communities.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:34:01):**  I don't think the chains will ever be able to integrate into our local food communities  
**[0:34:06-0:34:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:34:06):**  the way a food co-op, for example, can.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:34:09):**  One way in which we can see a grocery store, whether it's a food co-op or not, being integrated  
**[0:34:15-0:34:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:34:15):**  within a food system is the way in which some grocery stores, including chains, will actually  
**[0:34:21-0:34:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:34:21):**  allow for their parking lot to be used as a farmers market once a week.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:34:27):**  And of course that benefits both the grocery store, it benefits the farmers market, it  
**[0:34:31-0:34:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:34:31):**  allows for people to show up and buy food from as many local producers as possible and  
**[0:34:38-0:34:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:34:38):**  then get everything else that they can't find at the farmers market at the grocery store.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:34:42):**  Some chains do do that and some of the examples I share in the book, though, of food co-ops  
**[0:34:48-0:34:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:34:48):**  and the way in which they integrate into the food community in their local areas is through  
**[0:34:54-0:35:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:34:54):**  support of CSAs, for example, and many food co-ops will act as drop-off points for CSAs,  
**[0:35:04-0:35:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:35:04):**  so many of these CSAs also don't rely entirely on selling to their shareholders, they'll  
**[0:35:09-0:35:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:35:09):**  also rely on selling into co-ops or grocery stores as well.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:35:13):**  So it's a way to support these farmers who are running CSAs to also just have one drop-off  
**[0:35:19-0:35:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:35:19):**  point for their produce that's going into the grocery store as well as going to their  
**[0:35:24-0:35:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:35:24):**  members.  
**[0:35:25-0:35:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:35:25):**  It also allows for the farmer to not have to stand around and deliver those bins of  
**[0:35:33-0:35:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:35:33):**  weekly vegetables, for example.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:35:35):**  The grocery store, like many food co-ops, do do this.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:35:38):**  I share some examples in the book of food co-ops who once a year will host CSA fairs.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:35:45):**  So one of them is the Seward Co-op in Minneapolis, Minnesota, who will host a CSA fair where  
**[0:35:52-0:35:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:35:52):**  people can come and meet their farmer who they might want to invest in at the beginning  
**[0:35:56-0:35:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:35:56):**  of the season.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:35:58):**  If I have my numbers correct, there's something like 40 or so farms that will show up at this  
**[0:36:03-0:36:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:36:03):**  event and it's a way for eaters to link up with their farmer.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:36:09):**  It's actually quite remarkable that a grocery store would essentially be supporting what  
**[0:36:16-0:36:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:36:16):**  in the dominant marketplace would be considered the competition.  
**[0:36:20-0:36:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:36:20):**  So you have here this grocery store that's creating this space to essentially lose customers  
**[0:36:26-0:36:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:36:26):**  to say, you know, we're okay with you, our customer, going and buying all of your food  
**[0:36:31-0:36:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:36:31):**  from this farmer.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:36:34):**  But food co-ops, they understand that this is actually a benefit to them because to them  
**[0:36:39-0:36:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:36:39):**  it's ensuring that their supplier, farmers supplying them with food, has the diversity  
**[0:36:45-0:36:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:36:45):**  of markets to sell into, which anyone in business would want to make sure they have.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:36:51):**  You never want to rely on just one customer, whether it's just relying on eaters at a farmer's  
**[0:36:56-0:36:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:36:56):**  market or just relying on one grocery store.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:36:59):**  It's important for these businesses to have a diversity of customers and it's important  
**[0:37:04-0:37:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:37:04):**  for, particularly for these farmers to be able to receive 100% of the food dollar rather  
**[0:37:13-0:37:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:37:13):**  than a grocery store to take some of it.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:37:14):**  So these food co-ops understand that in order for their suppliers that they rely on in order  
**[0:37:22-0:37:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:37:22):**  to differentiate themselves from the market, in order to adhere to their values of supporting  
**[0:37:28-0:37:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:37:28):**  their community, they know that these farmers need these other channels to sell to.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:37:34):**  It's a remarkable example of how a grocery store can be an integral part of a local food  
**[0:37:41-0:37:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:37:41):**  system.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:37:42):**  And like I say, the chains, I don't think we'll ever be able to get to that place because  
**[0:37:47-0:37:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:37:47):**  they're so in the mindset of competition that the idea of being able to act as a community,  
**[0:37:56-0:38:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:37:56):**  I don't think we'll ever reach the head offices of the largest chains in the country.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:38:00):**  Hmm.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:38:01):**  Yeah, it's a tough one.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:38:04):**  Certainly when businesses get that large, they lose a lot of their flexibility or their  
**[0:38:09-0:38:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:38:09):**  nimbleness to react to changes in the market.  
**[0:38:12-0:38:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:38:12):**  Now speaking of these business models, let's go back to the beginning and define what a  
**[0:38:18-0:38:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:38:18):**  co-op is.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:38:19):**  How does it separate itself from these grocery chains that we've identified have really manipulated  
**[0:38:25-0:38:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:38:25):**  the food system up to this point?  
**[0:38:29-0:38:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:38:29):**  I think the most important way to differentiate between the two is cooperatives are within  
**[0:38:43-0:38:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:38:43):**  all sectors of the economy.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:38:46):**  And there are many different types of co-ops.  
**[0:38:49-0:38:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:38:49):**  So you have cooperatives that are consumer co-ops, which are the ones that are the focus  
**[0:38:54-0:38:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:38:54):**  of my book.  
**[0:38:55-0:39:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:38:55):**  They're cooperatives that are owned by the people who shop and use the services of the  
**[0:39:03-0:39:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:39:03):**  business.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:39:04):**  So you can have a consumer co-op be a car share, for example.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:39:10):**  So I'm a member of a car share co-op and I am a consumer of renting a vehicle, for example.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:39:17):**  And same with retail food co-ops.  
**[0:39:21-0:39:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:39:21):**  You know, I'm a consumer of the grocery store.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:39:23):**  It's a consumer co-op.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:39:24):**  Then you have worker co-ops, where it's a business that's owned by the workers.  
**[0:39:29-0:39:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:39:29):**  You can also have a hybrid of the two, where it's a business that's owned by consumers  
**[0:39:33-0:39:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:39:33):**  and workers.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:39:35):**  You have credit unions, which are essentially consumer co-ops.  
**[0:39:38-0:39:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:39:38):**  They're financial institutions owned by the people who use the credit union.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:39:44):**  So this is the main difference between a co-op and a privately owned business, is that co-ops  
**[0:39:50-0:39:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:39:50):**  are owned by the people who benefit from either the goods or services that the business is  
**[0:39:55-0:39:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:39:55):**  offering.  
**[0:39:56-0:40:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:39:56):**  So as an owner, the biggest way to exercise your democratic right as an owner is to vote  
**[0:40:04-0:40:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:40:04):**  once a year for the board of directors, which, similar to a private or publicly held company,  
**[0:40:12-0:40:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:40:12):**  these businesses will have investors or shareholders who are determining who the board is that  
**[0:40:17-0:40:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:40:17):**  represents their interests.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:40:19):**  And the same thing is the case with consumer food co-ops, where once a year, as an example,  
**[0:40:24-0:40:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:40:24):**  I'm a member of our co-op here in Nelson, BC, the Kootenai co-op.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:40:29):**  Once a year, I'll go and vote for a board of directors who will represent my interests.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:40:34):**  At one point for 10 years, I was a board director.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:40:37):**  So I would serve a two-year term, and every two years, if I wanted to run again, I would  
**[0:40:43-0:40:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:40:43):**  put myself forward, make a case, just like in any sort of democratic process, as to why  
**[0:40:49-0:40:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:40:49):**  I should be elected as a board director.  
**[0:40:53-0:40:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:40:53):**  And in many cases, these are volunteer roles or not volunteer.  
**[0:40:57-0:41:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:40:57):**  There's a small stipend that board directors will receive, maybe credit at the store every  
**[0:41:01-0:41:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:41:01):**  month.  
**[0:41:03-0:41:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:41:03):**  It's a way for you as a consumer to feel trust in the owner of your store, because it's you.  
**[0:41:15-0:41:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:41:15):**  And that's the biggest difference.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:41:17):**  And of course, there's many other benefits.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:41:20):**  Many consumer food co-ops will return a portion of their profits to their members.  
**[0:41:28-0:41:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:41:28):**  So this is something that I think is really important.  
**[0:41:29-0:41:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:41:29):**  So when we walk into any grocery store, there might be this experience that we have that  
**[0:41:36-0:41:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:41:36):**  the store is trying to take advantage of us.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:41:39):**  They're profiting off of us.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:41:41):**  And of course, they are.  
**[0:41:42-0:41:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:41:42):**  That's the case.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:41:44):**  They're in the business of making a profit, as the case with a chain retailer, of sending  
**[0:41:50-0:41:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:41:50):**  those profits to their shareholders, which could be people all over the planet.  
**[0:41:57-0:42:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:41:57):**  But in the case of a food co-op, it's not possible for the store to take advantage of  
**[0:42:02-0:42:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:42:02):**  its members or consumers, because all of those profits that that co-op makes either go right  
**[0:42:08-0:42:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:42:08):**  back into the business that you're using and benefiting from.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:42:12):**  Many of those food dollars that we put forward at the cash are also going into community  
**[0:42:18-0:42:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:42:18):**  organizations, into the community.  
**[0:42:22-0:42:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:42:22):**  And anything that is above and beyond what might go back into the business is often,  
**[0:42:29-0:42:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:42:29):**  not in every case, but often returned back to the members.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:42:32):**  So there have been years where this has been the case at our co-op, where based on how  
**[0:42:37-0:42:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:42:37):**  much I've purchased through the year, I will get a percentage of my purchases returned  
**[0:42:42-0:42:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:42:42):**  to me.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:42:43):**  And we're not talking thousands of dollars here.  
**[0:42:47-0:42:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:42:47):**  I've received checks for $15.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:42:50):**  I've received a check for $100 at the end of the year.  
**[0:42:53-0:42:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:42:53):**  But as a business, this can amount to tens of thousands of dollars, if not more, that  
**[0:42:59-0:43:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:42:59):**  gets distributed back out into the membership.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:43:02):**  So it's not possible for a co-op to take advantage of its members.  
**[0:43:07-0:43:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:43:07):**  It's a beautiful business model that is something that has existed for really hundreds of years  
**[0:43:14-0:43:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:43:14):**  in a more sort of organized and sustained fashion.  
**[0:43:17-0:43:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:43:17):**  I think you can really just look back about 100 years or a little more to when really  
**[0:43:23-0:43:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:43:23):**  this model began to be formalized and started to grow over the years through, as I described  
**[0:43:29-0:43:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:43:29):**  in the book, through various waves of development.  
**[0:43:33-0:43:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:43:33):**  And often they've coincided with usually economic hardship, where we start to, and I say we  
**[0:43:41-0:43:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:43:41):**  as in the royal we, where historically people have felt they've been getting taken advantage  
**[0:43:48-0:43:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:43:48):**  of, perhaps the economy has faltered in some way where you start to feel and see the hardship  
**[0:43:56-0:44:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:43:56):**  that's being created by the systems around us, and it compels these waves of response.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:44:03):**  And cooperatives isn't the only way people have responded to those hardships, but cooperatives  
**[0:44:08-0:44:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:44:08):**  have certainly been one of them.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:44:10):**  And that's where we've seen, at least with food co-ops, we've seen that wave.  
**[0:44:14-0:44:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:44:14):**  We've seen waves of food co-op development after the Great Depression.  
**[0:44:17-0:44:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:44:17):**  We've seen waves of food co-op development in the sort of late sixties, early seventies.  
**[0:44:22-0:44:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:44:22):**  And again, we're seeing again now in this period, which as I say, is a track in the  
**[0:44:29-0:44:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:44:29):**  book, began around 2008 through now.  
**[0:44:33-0:44:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:44:33):**  We're still seeing development.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:44:34):**  All right.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:44:35):**  So now that we have co-ops kind of defined in their structure, and like you said, they  
**[0:44:40-0:44:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:44:40):**  can be many other things other than grocery stores, let's focus on what co-ops can do  
**[0:44:45-0:44:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:44:45):**  for a community other than just provide high quality food from ethical sources.  
**[0:44:51-0:44:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:44:51):**  Yeah.  
**[0:44:52-0:44:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:44:52):**  You know, well, that's a few chapters of the book right there.  
**[0:44:56-0:45:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:44:56):**  And one that I think really stands out for me that sort of goes beyond what's on the  
**[0:45:03-0:45:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:45:03):**  shelves of the grocery store, beyond the food, is by being a cooperative that's headquartered  
**[0:45:11-0:45:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:45:11):**  and located right within our community, it means that the head office of the grocery  
**[0:45:16-0:45:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:45:16):**  store is also in our community.  
**[0:45:18-0:45:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:45:18):**  You know, so the model of chain retailers, regardless of what's on their shelves, you  
**[0:45:24-0:45:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:45:24):**  know, grocery being the example here, is that you have these outposts really within communities  
**[0:45:31-0:45:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:45:31):**  of this larger chain that is headquartered somewhere else.  
**[0:45:35-0:45:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:45:35):**  And so a lot of the resources that go into running that grocery store that's in our neighborhood,  
**[0:45:41-0:45:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:45:41):**  in our community, a lot of the resources that are needed to run it aren't within our community.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:45:46):**  They're either in regional offices or in head offices.  
**[0:45:50-0:45:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:45:50):**  And so this is where co-ops really differentiate themselves and I think really stand out and  
**[0:45:55-0:46:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:45:55):**  really support our communities is that it places the entire head office of the grocery  
**[0:46:01-0:46:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:46:01):**  store, often in the store itself.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:46:03):**  You know, so I would say about 90% of co-ops are independent single store co-ops.  
**[0:46:13-0:46:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:46:13):**  So that usually means the entire staff is within the store itself.  
**[0:46:17-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:46:17):**  In some cases you might have an office down the street or across the room where the head  
**[0:46:21-0:46:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:46:21):**  office is, and then you have another 10% of co-ops that have multiple locations, whether  
**[0:46:27-0:46:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:46:27):**  it's two locations or as large as the case with PCC approaching, I think, 15 locations  
**[0:46:34-0:46:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:46:34):**  soon.  
**[0:46:35-0:46:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:46:35):**  Where in their case, you know, they do have a head office that's outside of the grocery  
**[0:46:39-0:46:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:46:39):**  store, but is all within the Seattle area of Washington in that example.  
**[0:46:44-0:46:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:46:44):**  And so of course what this means is we have that many more people employed in a grocery  
**[0:46:49-0:46:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:46:49):**  store than we would a pain retailer operating, you know, from a distance in our community.  
**[0:46:56-0:47:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:46:56):**  So you know, if you take an example like Nelson BC and my co-op, the Kootenai co-op where  
**[0:47:03-0:47:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:47:03):**  I shop, like I said earlier, you know, we're a small community.  
**[0:47:08-0:47:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:47:08):**  We have 10,000 people.  
**[0:47:10-0:47:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:47:10):**  We're a hub for a much larger population of maybe, you know, a total of 20,000 people  
**[0:47:17-0:47:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:47:17):**  who sort of use Nelson as its sort of central place of shopping and commerce and work.  
**[0:47:24-0:47:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:47:24):**  Our co-op is the largest non-governmental employer in the city.  
**[0:47:29-0:47:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:47:29):**  So you know, we have a Walmart in our community.  
**[0:47:33-0:47:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:47:33):**  We employ more people than the Walmart.  
**[0:47:35-0:47:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:47:35):**  We employ 170 people.  
**[0:47:39-0:47:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:47:39):**  I think it's at least 170, if not more now at the store.  
**[0:47:44-0:47:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:47:44):**  So again, you know, the largest employer within a community of 10,000 people with 170 people  
**[0:47:51-0:47:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:47:51):**  employed, that's not something you would generally find in a grocery store in a community of  
**[0:47:57-0:47:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:47:57):**  our size.  
**[0:47:58-0:48:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:47:58):**  No, yeah, that's significant.  
**[0:48:00-0:48:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:48:00):**  It's huge.  
**[0:48:01-0:48:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:48:01):**  And you know, I think for a community to look at its future and to say, you know, what is  
**[0:48:07-0:48:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:48:07):**  it that's going to keep people here?  
**[0:48:10-0:48:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:48:10):**  What is it that's going to sustain everything else we love about our community, which in  
**[0:48:15-0:48:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:48:15):**  Nelson's case is the outdoors and skiing.  
**[0:48:18-0:48:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:48:18):**  And you know, these are things that we value here.  
**[0:48:21-0:48:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:48:21):**  You know, what is it that's going to keep people living here and enjoying this place?  
**[0:48:25-0:48:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:48:25):**  Well, it's having meaningful, strong, long lasting employment.  
**[0:48:30-0:48:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:48:30):**  And everyone needs to buy food.  
**[0:48:33-0:48:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:48:33):**  Everyone needs to access food in some form or another.  
**[0:48:37-0:48:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:48:37):**  And so grocery stores can service that in any community of any size, but can they actually  
**[0:48:42-0:48:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:48:42):**  employ a significant part of the population?  
**[0:48:46-0:48:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:48:46):**  And the chains just simply don't.  
**[0:48:48-0:48:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:48:48):**  They can't because the human resources, as in the human resource department, the marketing  
**[0:48:55-0:48:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:48:55):**  department, finance department, you know, all of these are located right within the  
**[0:48:59-0:49:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:48:59):**  store itself.  
**[0:49:01-0:49:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:49:01):**  And so what this means too is that the people who are making the most important decisions  
**[0:49:05-0:49:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:49:05):**  to the store are people who live in the community, who want to stay in the community for many  
**[0:49:12-0:49:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:49:12):**  years to come, if not the rest of their lives, and have every reason to show up at work that  
**[0:49:20-0:49:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:49:20):**  day and put all of their energy into making sure that the decisions being made by that  
**[0:49:24-0:49:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:49:24):**  co-op are going to benefit them and their families and their communities for many years,  
**[0:49:28-0:49:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:49:28):**  if not generations to come.  
**[0:49:30-0:49:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:49:30):**  And those are the most important decisions tend to be made at that sort of higher, if  
**[0:49:37-0:49:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:49:37):**  you want to call it, level of the organization, at that managerial level, where again, those  
**[0:49:43-0:49:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:49:43):**  aren't decisions that are being made locally at a chain.  
**[0:49:47-0:49:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:49:47):**  So that's just one example, but it's one that I think really stands out and it's one that's  
**[0:49:51-0:49:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:49:51):**  easily forgotten when it comes to comparing this model of either a co-op grocery store  
**[0:49:59-0:50:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:49:59):**  or a chain grocery.  
**[0:50:02-0:50:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:50:02):**  Now there's another issue that's become a hot button topic, especially in recent years,  
**[0:50:07-0:50:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:50:07):**  and that's the idea of food deserts.  
**[0:50:09-0:50:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:50:09):**  And I've recorded podcasts with other contributors in the past who have really highlighted this  
**[0:50:14-0:50:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:50:14):**  issue.  
**[0:50:15-0:50:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:50:15):**  And I was really drawn to this section of the book where you talked about how co-ops  
**[0:50:18-0:50:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:50:18):**  can help to remediate the issue of food deserts in underserved populations.  
**[0:50:24-0:50:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:50:24):**  Can you talk a little bit about how they're able to do that?  
**[0:50:27-0:50:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:50:27):**  Yeah, and I would offer a disclaimer on that first is that I think the promise of food  
**[0:50:38-0:50:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:50:38):**  co-ops and the possibility of food co-ops being able to remediate food deserts, and  
**[0:50:44-0:50:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:50:44):**  it sounds like your listeners are familiar with food deserts, but quickly for those that  
**[0:50:49-0:51:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:50:49):**  aren't, a food desert is generally defined as a neighborhood where a certain number of  
**[0:51:02-0:51:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:51:02):**  the population or percentage of the population is defined as low income and is more than  
**[0:51:08-0:51:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:51:08):**  one mile from a full service grocery store.  
**[0:51:12-0:51:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:51:12):**  So we're not talking close to a convenience store or close to a fast food chain.  
**[0:51:19-0:51:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:51:19):**  We're talking like full service grocery store where you have access to fresh produce, dairy,  
**[0:51:24-0:51:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:51:24):**  and all the things that we would normally consider to be a balanced diet.  
**[0:51:28-0:51:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:51:28):**  So this would be considered a food desert if you're within more than one mile from a  
**[0:51:34-0:51:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:51:34):**  grocery store.  
**[0:51:35-0:51:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:51:35):**  In rural areas, it's upwards to 10 miles.  
**[0:51:37-0:51:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:51:37):**  And food deserts, although that term is defined for neighborhoods that have a significant,  
**[0:51:46-0:51:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:51:46):**  notable low income population, it's something that does affect neighborhoods and communities  
**[0:51:52-0:51:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:51:52):**  regardless of income levels.  
**[0:51:53-0:51:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:51:53):**  It can be a place that is of middle income or even higher income, but of course in the  
**[0:51:58-0:52:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:51:58):**  middle or higher income, there's a much larger chance of having access to transportation.  
**[0:52:02-0:52:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:52:02):**  And so the issue isn't as dire because we can hop into a vehicle and drive somewhere.  
**[0:52:08-0:52:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:52:08):**  But of course that too is not something we want to be relying on.  
**[0:52:11-0:52:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:52:11):**  So this idea of not having access to grocery stores is a very significant concern.  
**[0:52:18-0:52:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:52:18):**  Of course with food deserts, we're talking about the more dire circumstance of really  
**[0:52:23-0:52:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:52:23):**  not being able to access a grocery store, particularly for people without access to  
**[0:52:28-0:52:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:52:28):**  transportation.  
**[0:52:29-0:52:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:52:29):**  So food co-ops as an alternative is something that I write about in the book.  
**[0:52:34-0:52:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:52:34):**  And I should say that I had no original intention to go into this area of subject matter in  
**[0:52:42-0:52:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:52:42):**  the book until I started to learn of what are starting to be a small number of communities  
**[0:52:51-0:52:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:52:51):**  who are looking at the food co-op model for that very reason.  
**[0:52:55-0:53:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:52:55):**  And so there are examples shared in the book, one in particular of a co-op in Greensboro,  
**[0:53:01-0:53:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:53:01):**  North Carolina, where you had a community there that had been without a grocery store  
**[0:53:05-0:53:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:53:05):**  for, I don't have that number in front of me right now, but it was over 15 years, I  
**[0:53:10-0:53:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:53:10):**  think upwards of 18 years, that the community was without a grocery store.  
**[0:53:15-0:53:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:53:15):**  And at some point within that time, residents had organized themselves and started to try  
**[0:53:22-0:53:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:53:22):**  to encourage chain retailers to come into their neighborhood.  
**[0:53:27-0:53:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:53:27):**  And none of them wanted to.  
**[0:53:30-0:53:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:53:30):**  Despite the area demonstrating that you could make a profit as a grocery store, none of  
**[0:53:34-0:53:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:53:34):**  the chains wanted to come in.  
**[0:53:36-0:53:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:53:36):**  And so they turned to the cooperative sector to consider that as a model to build a grocery  
**[0:53:45-0:53:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:53:45):**  store.  
**[0:53:46-0:53:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:53:46):**  So to do as I described earlier, to encourage people within the community to become an owner  
**[0:53:53-0:53:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:53:53):**  in your grocery store, to become a shareholder in your grocery store.  
**[0:53:57-0:54:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:53:57):**  And for many years they began developing that model.  
**[0:54:00-0:54:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:54:00):**  And so this is something that has existed now for this particular need for not very  
**[0:54:08-0:54:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:54:08):**  long.  
**[0:54:09-0:54:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:54:09):**  And they were, and I say were because unfortunately just earlier this year they closed their doors,  
**[0:54:14-0:54:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:54:14):**  they were the first real substantial example of a community in that circumstance using  
**[0:54:22-0:54:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:54:22):**  the co-op model.  
**[0:54:24-0:54:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:54:24):**  And so as much as I want to say, I think this is the future and I think this is a way for  
**[0:54:31-0:54:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:54:31):**  these types of communities to find security in a grocery store model.  
**[0:54:37-0:54:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:54:37):**  It's still so early on.  
**[0:54:39-0:54:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:54:39):**  And of course we have this example here of what wanted to be a success and was a success  
**[0:54:44-0:54:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:54:44):**  in many instances, right?  
**[0:54:46-0:54:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:54:46):**  That they were able to open their doors and operate for a couple of years.  
**[0:54:50-0:54:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:54:50):**  And yet it wasn't able to sustain itself.  
**[0:54:53-0:55:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:54:53):**  And so I think communities of all types, including low income communities, they are looking at  
**[0:55:01-0:55:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:55:01):**  the co-op model.  
**[0:55:04-0:55:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:55:04):**  I think it's still too early to tell, is this going to be a model that can work?  
**[0:55:08-0:55:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:55:08):**  And my personal opinion is that I think it will.  
**[0:55:11-0:55:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:55:11):**  I think we're just in that early stage where it's trying to figure itself out because generally  
**[0:55:17-0:55:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:55:17):**  food co-ops have been much more common and almost synonymous with natural or what we  
**[0:55:25-0:55:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:55:25):**  might want to define as natural, organic and local foods.  
**[0:55:29-0:55:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:55:29):**  And that's generally been how food co-ops have evolved.  
**[0:55:32-0:55:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:55:32):**  They've evolved in sort of that sector of the consumer economy.  
**[0:55:38-0:55:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:55:38):**  But I think this is the next evolution in the cooperative model is seeing this resource  
**[0:55:46-0:55:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:55:46):**  that's being created by the cooperative sector being accessible now to more and more people.  
**[0:55:54-0:55:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:55:54):**  And so you have groups like the Food Co-op Initiative, which is a nonprofit that has  
**[0:55:59-0:56:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:55:59):**  been supported by the entire co-op food co-op sector and larger cooperative sector, non-food  
**[0:56:05-0:56:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:56:05):**  co-op sector to help support startup food co-ops.  
**[0:56:11-0:56:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:56:11):**  And there's now a hundred startup food co-ops across the country.  
**[0:56:14-0:56:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:56:14):**  And of those, there's about a half dozen or so that are what might be defined as these  
**[0:56:20-0:56:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:56:20):**  food deserts, these areas without access to any grocery store whatsoever who are looking  
**[0:56:26-0:56:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:56:26):**  to the cooperative model.  
**[0:56:29-0:56:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:56:29):**  Like I say, I think we're still in that early stage of knowing whether or not this will  
**[0:56:34-0:56:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:56:34):**  become an answer to that challenge.  
**[0:56:38-0:56:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:56:38):**  Well, and speaking of that, there are threats to this co-op model and things preventing  
**[0:56:44-0:56:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:56:44):**  it from taking hold faster.  
**[0:56:47-0:56:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:56:47):**  So what, in your opinion, can we as consumers do to help these cooperative grocery stores  
**[0:56:54-0:56:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:56:54):**  to succeed besides, of course, just shopping there?  
**[0:56:57-0:57:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:56:57):**  Yeah, well, you know, I think one of the biggest challenges co-ops face right now, and it's  
**[0:57:05-0:57:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:57:05):**  not just me who thinks this, this is sort of the question that everyone within the food  
**[0:57:12-0:57:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:57:12):**  co-op community is asking is, how does the co-op sector differentiate itself?  
**[0:57:19-0:57:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:57:19):**  Because like I said, so many co-ops are within this local and organic food niche, and no  
**[0:57:28-0:57:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:57:28):**  longer is it really a niche in the sense that many of the chains...  
**[0:57:34-0:57:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:57:34):**  In fact, there's now at least a dozen natural food chains that have followed the Whole Foods  
**[0:57:41-0:57:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:57:41):**  lead, if you will, and are now growing at a similar pace that Whole Foods has at one  
**[0:57:47-0:57:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:57:47):**  point had grown.  
**[0:57:50-0:57:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:57:50):**  It's no longer easy for the food co-ops that had once operated in this kind of niche market  
**[0:57:57-0:57:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:57:57):**  to differentiate themselves.  
**[0:57:59-0:58:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:57:59):**  And so co-ops are asking themselves, well, how do we differentiate themselves?  
**[0:58:03-0:58:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:58:03):**  Or ourselves from the chain retailers?  
**[0:58:07-0:58:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:58:07):**  And there's so many ways in which they are different, many of which we've talked about  
**[0:58:12-0:58:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:58:12):**  here on your show.  
**[0:58:14-0:58:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:58:14):**  And yet being able to communicate that is the biggest challenge.  
**[0:58:18-0:58:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:58:18):**  And so to answer your question, what can eaters and what can consumers do?  
**[0:58:23-0:58:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:58:23):**  I think the biggest step that we can make as people who care about our local food systems,  
**[0:58:30-0:58:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:58:30):**  who care about our communities, is to, well, for one, like you say, shop at a co-op.  
**[0:58:36-0:58:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:58:36):**  But if you can't, and of course that's not the only thing we need to do, I think, we  
**[0:58:41-0:58:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:58:41):**  need to be able to inform ourselves about what differentiates co-ops from chains so  
**[0:58:47-0:58:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:58:47):**  that we can have those same conversations like we're having, so that those conversations  
**[0:58:52-0:58:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:58:52):**  can happen in the stores, they can happen around the dinner table, they can happen on  
**[0:58:56-0:59:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:58:56):**  the street, in our communities, they can happen in just the everyday conversation.  
**[0:59:04-0:59:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:59:04):**  The impact that I found in just having short two, three, five minute conversations with  
**[0:59:11-0:59:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:59:11):**  people about food co-ops, there is a lot of power in those moments to be able to inform  
**[0:59:20-0:59:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:59:20):**  of just some of the highlights, for example, from this conversation of what differentiates  
**[0:59:25-0:59:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:59:25):**  a co-op from a chain, in my experience has been that in offering just those little tidbits,  
**[0:59:31-0:59:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:59:31):**  like the elevator speech, the elevator pitch, for example, that moment can be the difference  
**[0:59:39-0:59:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:59:39):**  between somebody choosing to shop at a chain retailer or choosing to shop at a food co-op.  
**[0:59:46-0:59:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:59:46):**  So I think that's the biggest step to take, is to inform ourselves enough that we feel  
**[0:59:51-0:59:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:59:51):**  comfortable and confident to be able to share with one another why community owned grocery  
**[0:59:56-1:00:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:59:56):**  store is such an important part of changing the food system, of supporting our communities,  
**[1:00:03-1:00:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:00:03):**  of ensuring that people who are producing food in our communities can keep doing it  
**[1:00:07-1:00:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:00:07):**  for many generations to come.  
**[1:00:10-1:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:00:10):**  I think that's one of the biggest steps we can take.  
**[1:00:13-1:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:00:13):**  Absolutely.  
**[1:00:14-1:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:00:14):**  I mean, the education and awareness aspect of so many of the things that we talk about,  
**[1:00:18-1:00:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:00:18):**  and not just with our consumption models, but like where our resources, our food sources  
**[1:00:23-1:00:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:00:23):**  come from, how they're produced, what hands touch them until they get to our plates.  
**[1:00:30-1:00:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:00:30):**  And every step in between, just figuring out how much of that we want to support and how  
**[1:00:35-1:00:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:00:35):**  much we would like to see shift is really important because these are not terribly transparent  
**[1:00:40-1:00:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:00:40):**  industries.  
**[1:00:41-1:00:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:00:41):**  There's a lot of complexity in them.  
**[1:00:43-1:00:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:00:43):**  And that's one of the things that I found most valuable about the way that your book  
**[1:00:47-1:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:00:47):**  was laid out is it made it approachable.  
**[1:00:50-1:00:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:00:50):**  You could see the lineage, you could see some of the history about how we got where we are  
**[1:00:54-1:01:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:00:54):**  and how these alternative models have a real chance at affecting and transforming how we  
**[1:01:01-1:01:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:01:01):**  interact with our food system.  
**[1:01:03-1:01:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:01:03):**  Now I'm curious, before we start to wrap things up here, could you tell me a little bit about  
**[1:01:08-1:01:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:01:08):**  your own relationship with food?  
**[1:01:10-1:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:01:10):**  You said that you started to work in the hospitality sector and got more of an introduction into  
**[1:01:16-1:01:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:01:16):**  how things work through there, even before you started your own research.  
**[1:01:21-1:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:01:21):**  And I'm curious as to how you or sort of what were some of the most eye opening things that  
**[1:01:26-1:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:01:26):**  you learned as you became more aware of how this works?  
**[1:01:31-1:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:01:31):**  Yeah, well, you know, I think as I, you know, as I introduce the book in this way, I share  
**[1:01:39-1:01:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:01:39):**  my experience, particularly as a food systems journalist.  
**[1:01:45-1:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:01:45):**  And so, you know, I spent five years producing and hosting a radio show and podcast called  
**[1:01:51-1:01:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:01:51):**  Deconstructing Dinner.  
**[1:01:53-1:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:01:53):**  And I started doing that in 2006 and I began producing it here in Nelson, BC and it got  
**[1:02:00-1:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:02:00):**  syndicated on community stations all across Canada and quite a few in the US.  
**[1:02:05-1:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:02:05):**  And I did that for five years.  
**[1:02:06-1:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:02:06):**  And you can imagine, as I'm sure, you know, especially in your case, as well as a host  
**[1:02:13-1:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:02:13):**  of a podcast, every week that I would devote my time and energy into researching whatever  
**[1:02:19-1:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:02:19):**  the topic was on the show that week, every week, it would completely change my reality  
**[1:02:25-1:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:02:25):**  and my relationship to not only food, but to the everything around me, to the world.  
**[1:02:30-1:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:02:30):**  No longer, you know, was I living in ignorance or in denial.  
**[1:02:38-1:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:02:38):**  You know, for example, the moment I learned of the factory farming methods for, you know,  
**[1:02:45-1:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:02:45):**  hogs for pork, no longer could I touch that product.  
**[1:02:51-1:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:02:51):**  And so this was my life for five years where not only was I, you know, sharing this information  
**[1:02:59-1:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:02:59):**  on my radio show and podcast, I was also like transforming my own relationship to food at  
**[1:03:04-1:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:03:04):**  the same time.  
**[1:03:06-1:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:03:06):**  And so I naturally became involved in trying to source all of my food from everywhere but  
**[1:03:15-1:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:03:15):**  the grocery store.  
**[1:03:17-1:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:03:17):**  I spent all of my time invested in starting CSAs.  
**[1:03:21-1:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:03:21):**  You know, I became involved in helping launch Canada's first grain CSA.  
**[1:03:29-1:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:03:29):**  I was part of a vegetable CSA where I was going out to the farm and helping out on the  
**[1:03:34-1:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:03:34):**  farm.  
**[1:03:35-1:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:03:35):**  I was trying my own food.  
**[1:03:36-1:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:03:36):**  I was canning my own food.  
**[1:03:38-1:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:03:38):**  I was running an illegal raw milk collective because in most of Canada, it's illegal to  
**[1:03:44-1:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:03:44):**  retail raw milk.  
**[1:03:47-1:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:03:47):**  That's a wild thing that I wish we had more time to talk about that in itself is a topic  
**[1:03:52-1:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:03:52):**  to put a whole episode around.  
**[1:03:56-1:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:03:56):**  I was living a criminal lifestyle just to feed myself food that meant something to me  
**[1:04:01-1:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:04:01):**  and was valuable to me.  
**[1:04:04-1:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:04:04):**  I was getting a talk about a strong indicator that our food system and legislation is broken  
**[1:04:08-1:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:04:08):**  when you're doing that, just distributing whole milk.  
**[1:04:13-1:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:04:13):**  And milk, I was getting the illegal apple juice delivered to my front door because in  
**[1:04:20-1:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:04:20):**  this case, it was unpasteurized apple juice and it's not allowed to retail unpasteurized  
**[1:04:28-1:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:04:28):**  apple juice or at least at that point, it was.  
**[1:04:35-1:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:04:35):**  A lot of it was illegal from unlicensed processors, people who were processing the meat.  
**[1:04:43-1:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:04:43):**  This was my life.  
**[1:04:46-1:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:04:46):**  I think what's important for the sake of the question about how did that life lead to where  
**[1:04:55-1:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:04:55):**  this is now for me was I got to this place of personally just being exhausted at trying  
**[1:05:03-1:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:05:03):**  to sustain that lifestyle.  
**[1:05:07-1:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:05:07):**  It was really fun.  
**[1:05:08-1:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:05:08):**  It was something that I would never have changed and in many ways, I still eat in similar ways.  
**[1:05:17-1:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:05:17):**  I still access a lot of food from other places that aren't my grocery store.  
**[1:05:22-1:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:05:22):**  But I got to this place where some of these initiatives that I was a part of and the example  
**[1:05:27-1:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:05:27):**  I use in the book is the grain CSA.  
**[1:05:30-1:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:05:30):**  So this was a CSA that at one point had 450 members.  
**[1:05:34-1:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:05:34):**  This was only in its second year and we were sourcing upwards to about $75,000 worth of  
**[1:05:42-1:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:05:42):**  grain from a nearby valley not far from Nelson where we were supporting three farm families.  
**[1:05:50-1:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:05:50):**  We were getting access to oats, lentils, yellow peas, various varieties of wheat and spelt.  
**[1:06:01-1:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:06:01):**  We had 450 families.  
**[1:06:05-1:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:06:05):**  Then as the third year came and the fourth year came, the numbers started to decline  
**[1:06:10-1:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:06:10):**  significantly and as I began to ask people about what is it?  
**[1:06:15-1:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:06:15):**  Why is it you're not buying your grain again this year?  
**[1:06:20-1:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:06:20):**  The answers were pretty much unanimous.  
**[1:06:22-1:06:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:06:22):**  Everybody was still sitting on that grain that they got in their first year.  
**[1:06:29-1:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:06:29):**  So the excitement and interest and energy in the grain CSA which within two years led  
**[1:06:34-1:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:06:34):**  to this 450 families signing on.  
**[1:06:38-1:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:06:38):**  This was like $100 a family at the time, eventually $125 a share.  
**[1:06:46-1:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:06:46):**  People were investing a lot of money into this and yet when it came time to actually  
**[1:06:52-1:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:06:52):**  translating that into action which required every member of the CSA to either mill their  
**[1:07:02-1:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:07:02):**  own grain to turn it into flour or to roll their own oats or to bring it once a week  
**[1:07:08-1:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:07:08):**  to a local person who would be milling it for pennies, not much money at all in order  
**[1:07:15-1:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:07:15):**  to do that, but those extra steps of actually taking it there or doing it yourself wasn't  
**[1:07:22-1:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:07:22):**  something generally many members, certainly not all of them, but many members weren't  
**[1:07:27-1:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:07:27):**  willing to take on.  
**[1:07:30-1:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:07:30):**  That really just woke me up because I thought this grain CSA, I thought this was the future.  
**[1:07:37-1:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:07:37):**  I thought this is what will transform our food system locally.  
**[1:07:42-1:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:07:42):**  Everyone in our community is going to be eating locally grown grain within five, 10 years  
**[1:07:48-1:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:07:48):**  I thought.  
**[1:07:51-1:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:07:51):**  Sure enough, that wasn't the case.  
**[1:07:54-1:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:07:54):**  What this signaled to me was that as much interest and excitement as there is in these  
**[1:07:59-1:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:07:59):**  alternative models to accessing food, there's only ever, I shouldn't say ever, there only  
**[1:08:06-1:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:08:06):**  in the short term will be a small niche of people who are that devoted and committed.  
**[1:08:14-1:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:08:14):**  I'm still one of those people in the sense that I'm still the coordinator of a flour  
**[1:08:18-1:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:08:18):**  mill co-op where there's 25 of us who go own a flour mill and I still buy my grain from  
**[1:08:24-1:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:08:24):**  those farmers.  
**[1:08:26-1:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:08:26):**  I do think that that is the future because it is in that way that farmers can receive  
**[1:08:35-1:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:08:35):**  most of the food dollar that they possibly can.  
**[1:08:39-1:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:08:39):**  In many cases with wheat, as an example, a farmer is only getting 8 or 9 cents of the  
**[1:08:47-1:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:08:47):**  food dollar.  
**[1:08:48-1:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:08:48):**  That's not a lot of power in the marketplace.  
**[1:08:51-1:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:08:51):**  There's a lot of that dollar that's being taken from where we spend the money to what  
**[1:08:57-1:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:08:57):**  they receive.  
**[1:08:58-1:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:08:58):**  There's a lot of other links in that chain.  
**[1:09:01-1:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:09:01):**  Being able to give that money directly to that farmer, to me, is the future.  
**[1:09:06-1:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:09:06):**  But are we there yet is really the question that I came to in that journey for myself.  
**[1:09:13-1:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:09:13):**  We are there to a small degree, but in the 10 years that spanned 2006 to roughly around  
**[1:09:21-1:09:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:09:21):**  the time I started to work on this book, or at least conceive the book, in that 10 years,  
**[1:09:27-1:09:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:09:27):**  the percentage of our food dollars, and I say we as in North America, the percentage  
**[1:09:33-1:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:09:33):**  of our food dollars that was going to these direct market approaches like farmers markets  
**[1:09:39-1:09:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:09:39):**  and CSAs, it didn't change much.  
**[1:09:42-1:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:09:42):**  Certainly we saw the explosion of interest.  
**[1:09:45-1:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:09:45):**  No doubt there are more CSAs today than there were 10 years ago in a way that deserves a  
**[1:09:54-1:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:09:54):**  parade and celebration down the street, if not a national holiday to celebrate that.  
**[1:10:00-1:10:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:10:00):**  But in the grand scheme of things, the percentage of our food dollars barely changed.  
**[1:10:08-1:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:10:08):**  What we have now is, like I mentioned earlier, still 94% of consumer food dollars going towards  
**[1:10:15-1:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:10:15):**  some form of food retailer.  
**[1:10:17-1:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:10:17):**  It was there through my personal experience and through just my experience as an eater  
**[1:10:22-1:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:10:22):**  and as a journalist where all of a sudden my interest turned to grocery stores, where  
**[1:10:31-1:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:10:31):**  the local food movement and the interest among all of us to support new and alternative forms  
**[1:10:37-1:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:10:37):**  of food delivery and food access and food production, it just all started to funnel  
**[1:10:43-1:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:10:43):**  into this one place.  
**[1:10:45-1:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:10:45):**  This is where it seems like we need to be putting at least 94% of our energy is into  
**[1:10:52-1:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:10:52):**  our grocery stores that are operating in our community because this is where by and large  
**[1:10:57-1:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:10:57):**  most people are spending their money.  
**[1:10:59-1:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:10:59):**  I think it's through transforming the grocery stores in our communities that we can make  
**[1:11:05-1:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:11:05):**  these alternative models of accessing food like farmers markets, like CSAs, like educating  
**[1:11:12-1:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:11:12):**  all of us and educating ourselves on how to grow food and keep those skills and knowledge  
**[1:11:17-1:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:11:17):**  within our communities.  
**[1:11:19-1:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:11:19):**  All of those things will happen when we can support our grocery stores if they're food  
**[1:11:25-1:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:11:25):**  co-ops, if they're this model of grocery store that we know can sustain itself well into  
**[1:11:30-1:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:11:30):**  the future because it's owned by the community.  
**[1:11:33-1:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:11:33):**  It's not owned by someone who at any given moment might sell to another owner.  
**[1:11:40-1:11:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:11:40):**  We have these stories that have demonstrated and proven that they support CSAs, they support  
**[1:11:45-1:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:11:45):**  farmers markets, they're supporting the same people who are sustaining those alternative  
**[1:11:49-1:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:11:49):**  models of food production.  
**[1:11:52-1:11:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:11:52):**  These are the food co-ops that are the grocery stores that I think will enable these alternative  
**[1:11:59-1:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:11:59):**  models and this alternative food system and this food system that is the one that I think  
**[1:12:04-1:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:12:04):**  is the one that will be the most sustainable.  
**[1:12:07-1:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:12:07):**  It's going to be sustained by this model of grocery store.  
**[1:12:12-1:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:12:12):**  Well I got to say you make a very good and compelling argument through your book and  
**[1:12:16-1:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:12:16):**  to give people a little bit of context, I consider myself pretty well informed in general  
**[1:12:20-1:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:12:20):**  on the food system.  
**[1:12:21-1:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:12:21):**  I've worked in industrial farming, organic farming, permaculture farming.  
**[1:12:26-1:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:12:26):**  I even used to work as an engineer on ships maintaining the refrigerated cargo that brought  
**[1:12:32-1:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:12:32):**  fresh food from one side of the globe to the other.  
**[1:12:36-1:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:12:36):**  I have worked as a chef, a baker, I have helped to manage farmers market stalls and like a  
**[1:12:46-1:12:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:12:46):**  lot of other pieces in between and I got to say this was like the biggest gap in my knowledge.  
**[1:12:50-1:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:12:50):**  I didn't really understand though I have supported local co-op grocery stores in the past.  
**[1:12:57-1:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:12:57):**  In fact two of the ones that you've mentioned, the co-op network around Seattle I used to  
**[1:13:02-1:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:13:02):**  interact with quite a bit when I lived there and the Seward co-op in Minnesota close to  
**[1:13:07-1:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:13:07):**  where my brothers live I've frequented as well.  
**[1:13:11-1:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:13:11):**  I honestly really didn't understand how big of an impact on the food system these large  
**[1:13:17-1:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:13:17):**  grocery chains were and how viable of an alternative this co-op model was though I had like a minor  
**[1:13:24-1:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:13:24):**  insight into it.  
**[1:13:25-1:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:13:25):**  So before I let you go here could you share with our audience the ways that they can best  
**[1:13:31-1:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:13:31):**  get in touch with you where they can buy the book and how they can find out more about  
**[1:13:36-1:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:13:36):**  this topic.  
**[1:13:37-1:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:13:37):**  Yeah well so the website for the book is grocerystory.coop as in co-op so.coop and I'm going to be on  
**[1:13:49-1:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:13:49):**  a book tour for most of 2019 so I've got about 130 locations that I'm going to be over the  
**[1:13:58-1:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:13:58):**  next well for the remainder of 2019 and I would love to meet you know your listeners  
**[1:14:05-1:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:14:05):**  if there if if any of them are in the communities that I'll be visiting so that tour schedule  
**[1:14:10-1:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:14:10):**  is on the website.  
**[1:14:12-1:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:14:12):**  The book is coming out I mean the publication date is May 7th but it'll probably start hitting  
**[1:14:17-1:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:14:17):**  the shelves by late April and hopefully your local bookstores will have it you know like  
**[1:14:22-1:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:14:22):**  I think that to me is the most important thing is if you can support your local bookstore  
**[1:14:28-1:14:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:14:28):**  or find the book at one of your local food co-ops that would be my recommendation otherwise  
**[1:14:35-1:14:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:14:35):**  you know it's available everywhere else you can find books it's on Amazon it's on you  
**[1:14:41-1:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:14:41):**  know every online retailer that sells books or you can order it directly from my publisher  
**[1:14:47-1:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:14:47):**  which is New Society Publishers which I know your listeners are probably familiar with  
**[1:14:51-1:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:14:51):**  because I know you've interviewed quite a few authors who have published through New  
**[1:14:57-1:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:14:57):**  Society Publishers so the books also available there and and there's distribution all throughout  
**[1:15:02-1:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:15:02):**  North America and all over the world and and yeah like I said I would love to meet your  
**[1:15:08-1:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:15:08):**  listeners so hope you can make it out to one of my tour events and so that tour is running  
**[1:15:13-1:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:15:13):**  from April 15th where I my first date is in Rochester New York and I'm going to spend  
**[1:15:20-1:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:15:20):**  three months touring through the eastern US until about the end of June and then I'll  
**[1:15:25-1:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:15:25):**  be in Ontario for about a week and then I'll start up again in the fall and tour through  
**[1:15:33-1:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:15:33):**  the western Pacific Northwest British Columbia all the way down into the Midwest into the  
**[1:15:39-1:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:15:39):**  Twin Cities and through Milwaukee Chicago and then all the way back out to the California  
**[1:15:45-1:15:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:15:45):**  coast so that's going to be in the fall. Fantastic well look I'll make sure to include

**[1:16:04-1:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:16:04):**  and you're going to hit a few of the places where I know I'm going to be as well so yeah

**[1:16:12-1:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:16:12):**  way and hopefully do another follow up as we continue to learn more about this emerging  
**[1:16:19-1:16:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:16:19):**  resourceful and inspiring alternative that is really pushing the food movement in the  
**[1:16:24-1:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:16:24):**  correct direction. Hey I appreciate the time and your interest and yeah I look forward

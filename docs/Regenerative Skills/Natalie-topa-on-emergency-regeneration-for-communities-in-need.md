**[0:00:00-0:00:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:00:00):**  This is Regenerative Skills, the podcast helping you to learn the skills and solutions to create  
**[0:00:08-0:00:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:00:08):**  an abundant and connected future.  
**[0:00:10-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:00:10):**  I'm your host, Oliver Gautier.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:00:14):**  If you're enjoying the ideas and inspiration from the wide variety of guests and their  
**[0:00:18-0:00:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:00:18):**  experiences from the last five seasons of this podcast, just know that the best way  
**[0:00:23-0:00:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:00:23):**  to take the next step and deepen your knowledge in order to apply the skills and learning  
**[0:00:28-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:00:28):**  to regenerate your world is to read a book.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:00:31):**  New Society Publishers' vision is to provide the world with fundamental tools to help build  
**[0:00:36-0:00:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:00:36):**  a just and ecologically sustainable society, and many of the guests that I've interviewed  
**[0:00:41-0:00:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:00:41):**  here on the show are authors published by them.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:00:44):**  You can find all of their work in ebook, audiobook, and classic paperback at newsociety.org.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:00:50):**  Hey there, and welcome back everybody!  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:00:54):**  Now today I want to build on the focus of last week's episode with Morag Gamble, in  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:00:59):**  which we explored the challenges and opportunities for environmental and societal regeneration  
**[0:01:04-0:01:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:01:04):**  in refugee communities.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:01:07):**  One of the people that Morag mentioned in the interview, who is also pioneering regenerative  
**[0:01:11-0:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:01:11):**  work with refugee communities, was Natalie Topa.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:01:14):**  I immediately recognized that name from an inspiring webinar that I'd watched in which  
**[0:01:18-0:01:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:01:18):**  Natalie presented her work and design methods from her experience working in post-conflict  
**[0:01:23-0:01:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:01:23):**  and disaster zones, as well as refugee communities in East Africa.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:01:28):**  In general, I have so much respect for people who take on both the personal risk to go and  
**[0:01:33-0:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:01:33):**  work in conflict or post-disaster areas, and who take the heavy responsibility of deeply  
**[0:01:39-0:01:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:01:39):**  listening to members of the communities that they're working in to understand their unique  
**[0:01:43-0:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:01:43):**  situation before jumping to conclusions about the solutions that they think that those people  
**[0:01:48-0:01:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:01:48):**  need, and Natalie is an inspiring example of both of those capabilities.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:01:53):**  But let me take a few steps back and give you some context.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:01:56):**  Now Natalie Topa was born to a Polish immigrant mother and a Ukrainian refugee father who  
**[0:02:01-0:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:02:01):**  grew up in Rio de Janeiro.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:02:03):**  Natalie herself was born in Buffalo, New York, and then moved to Denver at the age of 5 and  
**[0:02:07-0:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:02:07):**  grew up in Colorado, where she completed her bachelor's degree in sociology and human  
**[0:02:12-0:02:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:02:12):**  services and a master's in urban and regional planning with a focus on economic development.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:02:18):**  She later moved to South Sudan after the signing of the 2005 peace agreement to work on post-war  
**[0:02:24-0:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:02:24):**  town planning and reconstruction, and then started to work with displaced populations  
**[0:02:28-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:02:28):**  on community reconstruction, agriculture, health and school facilities, water provision  
**[0:02:34-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:02:34):**  and civic engagement.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:02:36):**  Since then, Natalie has directed programs in climate change resilience using a systems-based  
**[0:02:41-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:02:41):**  approach that includes local governance, gender empowerment, market systems development, financial  
**[0:02:47-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:02:47):**  inclusion, food security, and natural resource management.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:02:51):**  Today she works as the regional resilience and livelihood coordinator for East Africa  
**[0:02:55-0:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:02:55):**  and Yemen for the European Refugee Agency, bringing principles of permaculture and resilience  
**[0:03:01-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:03:01):**  designed to post-disaster recovery, as well as root causes of displacement in multiple  
**[0:03:06-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:03:06):**  sectors.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:03:08):**  In this interview, Natalie starts by mapping out her wild journey into her unique line  
**[0:03:12-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:03:12):**  of work, and from there we talk about the learning journey that has added new tools  
**[0:03:16-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:03:16):**  and options to her repertoire along the way.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:03:20):**  From there, we started to explore the types of situations and challenges that she encounters  
**[0:03:24-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:03:24):**  when she is brought in to work with the community, and the process that she has developed to  
**[0:03:29-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:03:29):**  uncover the needs as well as the resources that those communities have.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:03:33):**  Natalie has so many examples of activities and exercises that she uses to get the full  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:03:38):**  range of people involved with the design and development process, and her stories are truly  
**[0:03:43-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:03:43):**  inspiring.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:03:44):**  This conversation goes into some incredible and unexpected places, and Natalie isn't in  
**[0:03:49-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:03:49):**  the least bit shy about talking about the realities and causes of the situations that  
**[0:03:53-0:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:03:53):**  she's encountered.  
**[0:03:55-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:03:55):**  So prepare yourself for a very candid and powerful conversation.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:03:58):**  And from there I'll hand things over to Natalie Topa.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:04:01):**  Natalie, first of all, thank you so much for taking the time to be here this morning.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:04:06):**  I'm really excited to speak to you after seeing that presentation that you did with Riley  
**[0:04:10-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:04:10):**  and Zach.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:04:12):**  And to start things off, I would love to get an idea of how you got to work in this space.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:04:17):**  I know it wasn't your original intention to start teaching permaculture and ecosystem  
**[0:04:21-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:04:21):**  restoration communities.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:04:23):**  Well, thanks, Oliver, and thanks also to Zach and Riley.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:04:29):**  There was really a positive response from that webinar, so I'm glad that people got  
**[0:04:33-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:04:33):**  to get some more insight on the work that's being done here.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:04:37):**  So as I just was mentioning to you before we started recording, I came here to work  
**[0:04:42-0:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:04:42):**  in South Sudan in 2005 to work on post-war town planning and reconstruction.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:04:47):**  And so I don't actually view what I'm doing now as different than that.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:04:52):**  It's all part of the same picture.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:04:54):**  It just has become more and more comprehensive as I'm always looking at addressing the root  
**[0:04:59-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:04:59):**  causes.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:05:00):**  I've been in the humanitarian sector for seven, actually 20 years now, because even before  
**[0:05:05-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:05:05):**  coming to Africa, I was seconded to FEMA to work on hurricane disaster recovery in Florida  
**[0:05:13-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:05:13):**  the year before Hurricane Katrina.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:05:15):**  So I came to South Sudan.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:05:18):**  I was working in this post-war environment where there were huge amounts of needs, including  
**[0:05:23-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:05:23):**  the need to create space and land for all of the returnees, the returning refugees that  
**[0:05:31-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:05:31):**  were going to be returning to South Sudan.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:05:32):**  So we were working with all the 10 state capitals as they were establishing themselves as state  
**[0:05:38-0:05:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:05:38):**  capitals.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:05:39):**  There was a lot of infrastructure going on.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:05:42):**  And then these human beings who were coming in who didn't have services, South Sudan was  
**[0:05:47-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:05:47):**  at that time just Southern Sudan.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:05:48):**  It was the lower half of the whole of Sudan.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:05:51):**  So people needed food.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:05:54):**  They needed water.  
**[0:05:55-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:05:55):**  They needed shelter.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:05:56):**  They're coming home after decades of war.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:06:00):**  And there were a lot of problems in the context at that time.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:06:03):**  Drought and flood were there 20 years ago, 17 years ago when I got there.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:06:07):**  And I just couldn't accept that this humanitarian emergency crisis response is the long-term  
**[0:06:15-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:06:15):**  solution because why would anyone accept that?  
**[0:06:20-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:06:20):**  So I just started to think, why do we have six months of water and six months of drought?  
**[0:06:25-0:06:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:06:25):**  Like, there's got to be a design question in here somehow.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:06:29):**  And so that's when I learned about permaculture as an ideology and systems-based science when  
**[0:06:36-0:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:06:36):**  I was in college, which was like 1990, I think between 1998 and 2000 was when I learned about  
**[0:06:43-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:06:43):**  it from my Brazilian roommate who's an anthropologist.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:06:46):**  And when she described it to me, I had such a clear picture of what she was talking about  
**[0:06:50-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:06:50):**  and the systemic interconnectedness.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:06:53):**  And so I sort of imbibed that in my journey in working in East Africa and tried to bring  
**[0:06:58-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:06:58):**  those concepts to my work.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:07:01):**  So the design, the solution-based approaches.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:07:05):**  Okay.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:07:06):**  So you used permaculture and I'm sure a lot of other learnings as additional tools to  
**[0:07:11-0:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:07:11):**  the original intention of helping people to rebuild after either catastrophe or displacement.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:07:17):**  And how did you start in that career path in the first place?  
**[0:07:20-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:07:20):**  What was your studies and what was the connections that led you to that?  
**[0:07:24-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:07:24):**  Well, so I don't even refer that often to permaculture because it's so all encompassing  
**[0:07:30-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:07:30):**  for me and people within our community and the regenerative community.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:07:35):**  Permaculture is everything.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:07:36):**  It's natural building, it's fermenting.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:07:39):**  So what took me on this path was first of all, when I was working in DC, I was working  
**[0:07:49-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:07:49):**  for a very large scale private firm, a globally renowned design firm.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:07:54):**  But they were dealing with more municipal level interventions.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:07:57):**  If it had to do with community development or minority communities, they were like, Topa,  
**[0:08:02-0:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:08:02):**  you're going to Southeast DC tonight or whatever.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:08:08):**  I always was driven by my ethics and a sense of social justice and all types of justice.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:08:18):**  And that includes ecological justice.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:08:21):**  So when I came to South Sudan, I just started to see a lot of opportunities.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:08:26):**  And I could sense even though at that time, 17 years ago, I may not have been as conversant  
**[0:08:31-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:08:31):**  in the issues of soil and degradation.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:08:34):**  I was seeing it happen all around me and it became very instinctual that something not  
**[0:08:38-0:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:08:38):**  good is happening and something is collapsing.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:08:41):**  I could see that in the landscape.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:08:44):**  To back up a little bit, I also come from an immigrant family.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:08:47):**  My mother is from Poland, from Novotad, not far from Zakopane.  
**[0:08:53-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:08:53):**  And then my biological father was a refugee from Ukraine, whose family got asylum in Brazil  
**[0:09:00-0:09:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:09:00):**  and he grew up in Rio.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:09:02):**  But then the person who raised me like a father was also a UNHCR registered refugee who left  
**[0:09:09-0:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:09:09):**  Poland to Germany.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:09:11):**  And so when we came to the US, the way that we connected with our culture, even though  
**[0:09:17-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:09:17):**  I was born in the US, but my heritage security relied on the relationship we had with nature  
**[0:09:24-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:09:24):**  and food.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:09:25):**  So we were doing a lot of wild forageology, though it wasn't called that at the time.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:09:31):**  But we would go and fish for crawdads and go fishing and pick mushrooms.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:09:38):**  And so having that relationship with my ecological surroundings was a really big foundation for  
**[0:09:43-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:09:43):**  me.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:09:44):**  And then coming into the space of moving forward back into South Sudan, I just started to understand  
**[0:09:52-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:09:52):**  that food security was a very huge issue.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:09:55):**  And especially when you're talking about a context that's a fragile state, instability,  
**[0:10:02-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:10:02):**  conflict and war, food is a really big deal, right?  
**[0:10:04-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:10:04):**  I mean, food is a big deal for all of us, but it just really can create a tipping point  
**[0:10:10-0:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:10:10):**  when a country is already destabilized for different socio economic and geopolitical  
**[0:10:14-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:10:14):**  reasons.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:10:15):**  That food can really be or lack of food can be a driving force towards conflict and brutality  
**[0:10:22-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:10:22):**  and things like that.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:10:23):**  So I started to study more and more.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:10:28):**  And then I moved to Nairobi, I was trying to do my own gardening and learning about  
**[0:10:33-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:10:33):**  composting and that in the video with more a gamble on balcony permaculture, I was testing  
**[0:10:38-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:10:38):**  so many things.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:10:41):**  And on my own learning journey, I was also cooking a lot.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:10:43):**  I'm kind of a home chef type person.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:10:46):**  So all of these things started to create a picture, you know, food, gardening, environment,  
**[0:10:52-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:10:52):**  ecology, displacement, the humanitarian context.  
**[0:10:55-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:10:55):**  So I just started to go deeper and deeper.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:10:57):**  And at one point, I stepped back, this was a number of years ago.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:11:00):**  And I just was like, I have to go for it.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:11:02):**  I'm going to take 18 months of a sabbatical.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:11:04):**  I don't know who I want to figure out who are the best of the best in the world on these  
**[0:11:08-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:11:08):**  things.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:11:09):**  So you know, I went to greening the desert Jordan, you know, sort of the starting point  
**[0:11:14-0:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:11:14):**  for a lot of people.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:11:16):**  And my mind was blown away by Tom Kendall.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:11:19):**  I knew at that moment that this is a massively transformative moment for my life.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:11:26):**  And then I immediately went to do another permaculture design course with Warren brush,  
**[0:11:30-0:11:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:11:30):**  who's been a mentor and a partner and a co trainer now and, you know, continues to be  
**[0:11:36-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:11:36):**  a strong mentor in my life.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:11:38):**  And one thing that Warren always reminds me is always give your life's energy to life  
**[0:11:45-0:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:11:45):**  affirming endeavors.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:11:46):**  So that's a really simple litmus test for what I get involved in.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:11:53):**  And then I went to I've gone three times to study with Dr. Vandana Shiva in India.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:11:58):**  I've studied water harvesting with Brad Lancaster and David Spicer, Dan building study damn  
**[0:12:03-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:12:03):**  building with Jeff Lawton.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:12:05):**  So and natural building with cg cocoa, if she if you know who cg cocoa is total superhero.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:12:11):**  Anyone in this world should always do classes with cg cocoa.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:12:16):**  So you know, between natural building and agroecology and agroforestry and the seed  
**[0:12:22-0:12:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:12:22):**  movement, I mean, all of these things started to fill in this bigger picture of all of the  
**[0:12:28-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:12:28):**  ways we have departed from a healthy, cyclical relationship with our living planet.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:12:37):**  So that's in a large not coconut shell synopsis, and then I just kept digging from there, right?  
**[0:12:47-0:12:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:12:47):**  There's no finish line to learning.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:12:49):**  So I've spent many nights, glasses of wine on YouTube going down all the rabbit holes  
**[0:12:54-0:12:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:12:54):**  like we all have.  
**[0:12:55-0:12:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:12:55):**  So there was no magic, you know, program or anything.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:12:59):**  It's just investing the time and calories to sit through all those YouTube videos.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:13:03):**  Oh, what a fantastic story that makes me feel better about my own learning journey, which  
**[0:13:08-0:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:13:08):**  has been a real patchwork quilt as well.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:13:11):**  A little bit from here.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:13:13):**  cg cocoa was one of the first people that I had in the first season while I was working  
**[0:13:17-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:13:17):**  through an internship in natural building in Guatemala.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:13:20):**  I worked on the ground with my in communities in bamboo building there, which led to learning  
**[0:13:26-0:13:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:13:26):**  more about designing ecology into the built space and how they can interact in a positive  
**[0:13:32-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:13:32):**  way.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:13:33):**  And all of these things, like you said, you start to pull the threads, you see how they're  
**[0:13:35-0:13:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:13:35):**  connected, and it just kind of balloons and evolves from there.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:13:40):**  And you mentioned earlier that your your core motivation was to find root causes behind  
**[0:13:46-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:13:46):**  some of the devastation and the displacement and the suffering that you were seeing in  
**[0:13:51-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:13:51):**  places that you were sent to work in.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:13:54):**  With these new toolboxes and new ways of seeing how things are connected systemically, what  
**[0:13:59-0:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:13:59):**  are some of these root causes that you started to uncover?  
**[0:14:04-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:14:04):**  Soil loss, soil loss, that is the big one.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:14:07):**  So and human stupidity, that's another big one.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:14:11):**  And I'm sick of us referring to stupidity as climate change.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:14:17):**  So I see people on LinkedIn and on social media keep showing photos of a drought stricken  
**[0:14:26-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:14:26):**  farm or landscape.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:14:28):**  And they're like, oh, climate change.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:14:30):**  And I'm like, zoom in.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:14:31):**  That is a totally tilled monocrop, chemically farmed nightmare that is obviously going to  
**[0:14:39-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:14:39):**  become desiccated.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:14:40):**  So let's not call that climate change, because it's just a complete lack of understanding  
**[0:14:47-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:14:47):**  of all of these systems that we really as humans need to be very literate.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:14:53):**  So soil loss, I've seen all over East Africa and everywhere.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:14:58):**  I mean, I've been I think to over 60 countries, and I'm pretty sure that in each one of those  
**[0:15:03-0:15:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:15:03):**  there's you will see great evidence of a systemic collapse in the local ecology.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:15:12):**  And that, of course, is it is the number one major environmental problem on our planet  
**[0:15:18-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:15:18):**  right now, followed then by loss of biodiversity, followed them by pollution.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:15:23):**  So it is systemic.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:15:24):**  I see even within the regenerative movement, people are like, oh, it's you've got to do  
**[0:15:30-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:15:30):**  holistic rangeland management.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:15:32):**  And there's this whole sort of very masculine meat related movement within the regenerative  
**[0:15:38-0:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:15:38):**  community.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:15:39):**  And then you have like the vegan situation and a lot of debate around plant based foods.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:15:45):**  I'm an omnivore.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:15:46):**  I eat vegetarian.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:15:48):**  Sorry.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:15:49):**  But I do really respect that people want to be vegetarian.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:15:53):**  They want to be vegan.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:15:54):**  I completely understand how that is.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:15:57):**  But regardless of what your food preferences are, coming back to the soil is a really,  
**[0:16:04-0:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:16:04):**  really key thing in the context where I work that are prone to conflict.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:16:09):**  That's loss of soil can translate to extreme water events, which drought is part of that,  
**[0:16:18-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:16:18):**  because as you know, when land starts to crust, you have increased runoff.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:16:23):**  And that means that water is moving away from where pastoralists need it.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:16:27):**  For example, here in East Africa, we have a lot of pastoralism and you have very large  
**[0:16:32-0:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:16:32):**  herds of camels, cows and what we call shows, which are shots and goats, and they need water  
**[0:16:39-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:16:39):**  and they need great viable grazing land.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:16:42):**  And so as that soil has just become hot and desiccated and cannot hold its holding capacity  
**[0:16:50-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:16:50):**  for water is reduced, communities who may have historically had peace accords and agreements  
**[0:16:59-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:16:59):**  around entering one another's turf for shared resources has collapsed.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:17:07):**  So I think that underpinning so many of the issues we have here is soil.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:17:13):**  Then obviously the hydrological collapse, the short water cycles.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:17:17):**  You can speak to elderly Africans who will say, I swam in a river that used to be where  
**[0:17:23-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:17:23):**  this pit of garbage is now, plastic bags and just dried up, maybe some lizards and insects  
**[0:17:31-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:17:31):**  crawling around.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:17:32):**  But yeah, the last loss of moisture and hydration in the landscape as well.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:17:38):**  Those are definitely the main root causes.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:17:39):**  And of course, the loss of biodiversity.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:17:42):**  So we have and connected to that is the severance with indigenous relationships with local ecology  
**[0:17:49-0:17:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:17:49):**  and ethnobotany.  
**[0:17:50-0:18:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:17:50):**  They are, this place is replete with medicinal plants and traditional foods and locally adapted  
**[0:18:00-0:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:18:00):**  genetic resources, although we don't like to call them that because that sounds like  
**[0:18:03-0:18:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:18:03):**  a commodifiable thing.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:18:05):**  But I think that there are social issues here, like stemming not only from colonialism, but  
**[0:18:12-0:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:18:12):**  a lot of other geopolitical forces and economic forces that there's a loss of that indigenous  
**[0:18:18-0:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:18:18):**  connection to the landscape.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:18:21):**  So I'll stop there, but lots of root causes.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:18:23):**  No, no, that's a fantastic way of laying it out.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:18:26):**  And much like you said at the beginning, it's often glossed over even from people who are  
**[0:18:31-0:18:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:18:31):**  trying to work in our space as, oh, it's climate change, right?  
**[0:18:34-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:18:34):**  Things are changing.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:18:35):**  And so there's no evidence that this is something that we caused that we can reverse.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:18:41):**  Whereas so much of your work and so many other examples from that area can show what is possible  
**[0:18:47-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:18:47):**  even under the exact same weather and climactic situations, when those trends are reversed,  
**[0:18:53-0:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:18:53):**  when the mindset is changed, when people start to replace the missing elements within the  
**[0:18:58-0:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:18:58):**  ecology, but also within those community dynamics that are affecting the ecology.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:19:01):**  I also wanted to add another root cause is our global economic system and the prioritization  
**[0:19:08-0:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:19:08):**  of capitalists, free market economies has been very damaging to ecologies all over the  
**[0:19:13-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:19:13):**  world.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:19:14):**  And so linked to that and regeneration is this concept of circular bioeconomy.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:19:20):**  How do we do resource recovery and give any extracted resources additional spins on the  
**[0:19:27-0:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:19:27):**  merry-go-round?  
**[0:19:29-0:19:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:19:29):**  So I do think that the economy that has been shaped, and I have to say it, I have to say  
**[0:19:33-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:19:33):**  it, sorry, Oliver, but male dominated industries all over the world, that is part of the social  
**[0:19:39-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:19:39):**  and environmental injustice that we're seeing and the sexual and gender injustice.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:19:45):**  We can't separate that out from the conversation because we can't have ecological justice until  
**[0:19:50-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:19:50):**  we have social justice, which is racial, it's gender, it's sexual, but all of those injustices  
**[0:19:56-0:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:19:56):**  really play out in the capitalist economy.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:20:00):**  So it's just time for a shift of like a wholesale shift.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:20:06):**  I completely agree and definitely don't feel sorry about calling out these things that  
**[0:20:10-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:20:10):**  you're seeing that you're experiencing all the time.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:20:12):**  And I mean, you could draw a pretty straight line between that and the effects on the ecology,  
**[0:20:17-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:20:17):**  but can you connect the dots for me here, how that kind of masculine led industries  
**[0:20:24-0:20:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:20:24):**  and violence at a community level has displaced people directly, has changed the culture in  
**[0:20:31-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:20:31):**  very recent years, but also stemming back to colonialism.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:20:34):**  Can you kind of put those dots in together?  
**[0:20:37-0:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:20:37):**  That's a really big topic with a lot of tears.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:20:40):**  Well first of all, you know, as Dr. Vandana Shiva says, and she's written many books that  
**[0:20:47-0:20:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:20:47):**  touch on this, is that food used to be the domain of women, okay?  
**[0:20:52-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:20:52):**  Women grew the food, there was their teeny little fingers, they selected the best seeds,  
**[0:20:59-0:21:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:20:59):**  everything around food production and cooking and the home and the kitchen and saving of  
**[0:21:04-0:21:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:21:04):**  seeds and propagating them and adapting them, all of that was really the space of women.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:21:10):**  And when we really started to poop the bed was when there was this wholesale masculinization  
**[0:21:15-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:21:15):**  of food systems.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:21:16):**  So what that means is that you had corporations which started to take over the role of food  
**[0:21:23-0:21:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:21:23):**  production, food processing, seed production, seed distribution, and yeah, I mean here in  
**[0:21:30-0:21:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:21:30):**  East Africa, you know, thank God there are, or whoever, thank goodness that there are  
**[0:21:35-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:21:35):**  so many efforts at a local level.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:21:39):**  You know, there are African actors who are actively trying to protect the seed systems  
**[0:21:47-0:21:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:21:47):**  and the seed security, right?  
**[0:21:50-0:21:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:21:50):**  So in terms of, I don't want to get too much into colonialism because I'm not as conversant  
**[0:21:56-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:21:56):**  and I don't want to represent what the African community might feel has been the impact,  
**[0:22:01-0:22:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:22:01):**  but for sure there's been an impact and hindrances.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:22:06):**  I mean, today, currently you have massive corporate forces that have entered this space  
**[0:22:14-0:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:22:14):**  and are trying to completely drive the show in terms of seed security.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:22:19):**  So you have large multinational petrochemical corporations that produce seeds and they produce  
**[0:22:25-0:22:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:22:25):**  the poison cocktails that are supposed to accompany them, you know, from a market perspective.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:22:31):**  And there's just mass campaigning and marketing to poor African farmers to use these stupid  
**[0:22:39-0:22:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:22:39):**  seeds that cannot be regenerated and saved and locally adapted and to purchase all of  
**[0:22:47-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:22:47):**  this chemistry.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:22:49):**  One major thing globally is that in agriculture, the knowledge about biology has been totally  
**[0:22:57-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:22:57):**  suppressed.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:22:58):**  We're not supposed to know that the chemistry comes from the biology because the biology  
**[0:23:03-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:23:03):**  we can feed locally to create the chemistry.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:23:06):**  But all you hear about is NPK, NPK.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:23:08):**  And when people here in at least in East Africa, but I'm sure it's the case, you know, throughout  
**[0:23:13-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:23:13):**  the continent, when they're learning about agronomy and agriculture, the focus is on  
**[0:23:20-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:23:20):**  corporate led NPK chemistry and totally ignoring and suppressing that what we need to be doing  
**[0:23:27-0:23:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:23:27):**  is feeding and nurturing and regenerating the biological cycles and nutrient cycles  
**[0:23:33-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:23:33):**  and hydrological cycles.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:23:34):**  So it's really bad news for these multinational corporations that people are like, wait a  
**[0:23:41-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:23:41):**  minute, I got this, you know, hold my beer.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:23:43):**  I'm going to go create chemistry through feeding my farm and soils.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:23:48):**  So I know that doesn't fully answer the question, but...  
**[0:23:52-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:23:52):**  No, no, it's like you mentioned, it's a very big question to unpack, but it definitely  
**[0:23:57-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:23:57):**  helps to clarify a few things.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:23:58):**  And certainly where I was working in Guatemala and in the Philippines, and I mean, even in  
**[0:24:05-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:24:05):**  the United States and here in Spain, it's not much different.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:24:08):**  There may be more access to a variety of information and a generally higher level of literacy and  
**[0:24:14-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:24:14):**  access to the Internet has certainly opened up opportunities to learn the types of things  
**[0:24:19-0:24:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:24:19):**  that we're talking about now.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:24:20):**  But it's still coming from an institutional base of chemistry, machinery, petrochemical  
**[0:24:27-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:24:27):**  infusion into the land as if that were the saving aspect that's going to turn everything  
**[0:24:32-0:24:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:24:32):**  around when that's also the source of how we got to the point where we are.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:24:36):**  And it's not unique to developing countries.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:24:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:24:40):**  And on that note, I can see, well, I don't know how we went from like organic to sustainable  
**[0:24:48-0:24:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:24:48):**  to regenerative to full on greenwashing within like a few months, it feels like.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:24:53):**  If you follow online, like you and I closely do, you know, the movement and different actors,  
**[0:24:59-0:25:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:24:59):**  you know, you've got large corporations.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:25:02):**  You know, I won't let me not say them specifically by name, but there's one that rhymes with  
**[0:25:06-0:25:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:25:06):**  by agra that, you know, is totally greenwashing and trying to say that they do regenerative  
**[0:25:11-0:25:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:25:11):**  agriculture when they are fully on the chemical trail.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:25:17):**  I did also want to mention that I see a lot of people trying to complicate regenerative  
**[0:25:26-0:25:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:25:26):**  approaches with gimmicks and high tech.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:25:28):**  Right.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:25:29):**  We don't need gimmicks.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:25:30):**  You don't need like a thing or a product or, you know, it is really about getting down  
**[0:25:37-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:25:37):**  back to the basics, getting our hands dirty.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:25:39):**  Like we we've got to do the hard work.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:25:42):**  Right.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:25:43):**  We don't need to purchase stock or credits or like we've actually got to do the work  
**[0:25:49-0:25:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:25:49):**  at the local level wherever we are.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:25:50):**  If I were you, I'd start in Barcelona.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:25:53):**  I'm here.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:25:54):**  So I'm starting here.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:25:56):**  But the gimmicks are really driving me nuts because when you see people doing like vertical  
**[0:26:00-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:26:00):**  farming and, you know, urban level and saying, oh, this is regenerative, I want to ask, can  
**[0:26:05-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:26:05):**  you explain to me what is it that you are regenerating with a bunch of fuel based, even  
**[0:26:11-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:26:11):**  if it's solar powers, those minerals and ores for photovoltaics come from a rape economy  
**[0:26:18-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:26:18):**  and Congo.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:26:19):**  Like that's not regenerative.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:26:21):**  So what are we trying to regenerate?  
**[0:26:23-0:26:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:26:23):**  What does your model regenerate?  
**[0:26:26-0:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:26:26):**  And also just going back really quickly to the root causes, I did also want to mention  
**[0:26:30-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:26:30):**  and the reason that you feel me being a little bit defensive about the gender conversation  
**[0:26:35-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:26:35):**  is because during that water stories webinar, I was reading some comments from the from  
**[0:26:41-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:26:41):**  the YouTube video and there was some chest pounding guy was like, well, you know, it  
**[0:26:47-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:26:47):**  was good, good webinar, except three mentioned patriarchy every five minutes.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:26:51):**  So I just responded to his comment with the word patriarchy.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:26:56):**  But I will say that why this is important and it is these are measurable things, right?  
**[0:27:01-0:27:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:27:01):**  There are really gendered dynamics around everything and globally, there have been some  
**[0:27:05-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:27:05):**  studies done, I think, was it by sea for or I can't remember exactly who, but this incredible  
**[0:27:10-0:27:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:27:10):**  case study that showed that in regions all over the world, women, women who are at home  
**[0:27:17-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:27:17):**  traditionally with babies need four piece different plants at different periods for  
**[0:27:23-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:27:23):**  different purposes at different periods.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:27:27):**  The thing is that that was a women around the world have always naturally practiced  
**[0:27:33-0:27:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:27:33):**  agroecology because they knew that they need things all the time.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:27:37):**  Every day they have to be able to harvest something or sell something or create, you  
**[0:27:42-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:27:42):**  know, create, build something.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:27:44):**  And then what happened was there was this masculinization of that where the where men  
**[0:27:49-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:27:49):**  who control most of the land, you know, women only hold two percent of the world's titled  
**[0:27:55-0:27:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:27:55):**  arable land only between one and two percent.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:27:59):**  So men started to say, no, we're going to use our entire family farm space to create  
**[0:28:03-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:28:03):**  mono crops for regional and global markets.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:28:06):**  And that's a real thing.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:28:09):**  Like suddenly, all of these home based smallholder farms that were based on agroecology had a  
**[0:28:17-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:28:17):**  massive shift towards mono crops for regional and global markets.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:28:21):**  And I think right now, post covid and with regenerative and circular movements, we are  
**[0:28:25-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:28:25):**  really coming home.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:28:27):**  We are localizing within our bioregional level, within our watersheds, within our fiber sheds.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:28:33):**  So that's exciting.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:28:34):**  And I'm not I'm I think there needs to be a balance.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:28:37):**  It doesn't have to be one or the other, but we've really got to find a proper balance  
**[0:28:41-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:28:41):**  so that we don't go extinct.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:28:43):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:28:44):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:28:45):**  And this is something that just isn't often talked about in the region space and the organic  
**[0:28:51-0:28:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:28:51):**  space.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:28:52):**  It's starting to come out and obviously there are some real champions of it.  
**[0:28:56-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:28:56):**  There are some real champions of this information that you're putting out there.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:28:59):**  Some of the people that you've studied with and people on the ground in these areas that  
**[0:29:02-0:29:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:29:02):**  just don't have the same platform as some more visible teachers or voices.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:29:08):**  So there are places where you can go and get better informed about this and dig into the  
**[0:29:12-0:29:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:29:12):**  history and the details of how this is playing out right now.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:29:17):**  And it goes back to another thing that you were talking about is focusing on life affirming  
**[0:29:21-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:29:21):**  endeavors.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:29:24):**  Much of this greenwashing can't be done when the root of what you were doing is affirming  
**[0:29:29-0:29:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:29:29):**  life on these places.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:29:30):**  If you're bringing in chemicals, if you're bringing in machinery to try and solve some  
**[0:29:33-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:29:33):**  problem, even if it's towards this concept of regeneration, an audit of that process  
**[0:29:38-0:29:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:29:38):**  needs to take place.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:29:40):**  Can you talk about some of the life affirming endeavors that you have really doubled down  
**[0:29:45-0:29:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:29:45):**  on in your own work that you've seen have a positive impact?  
**[0:29:49-0:29:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:29:49):**  Yeah, I mean, it's again, it's really going back to basics.  
**[0:29:53-0:29:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:29:53):**  It's not about gimmicks.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:29:54):**  It's all about low tech process based.  
**[0:29:56-0:30:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:29:56):**  So I took this great course on low tech process based riverscape restoration.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:30:02):**  And when what they explained is that when we say process based, we are looking at what  
**[0:30:06-0:30:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:30:06):**  are the natural processes?  
**[0:30:08-0:30:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:30:08):**  What are the processes of nature and ecology and biology all around us?  
**[0:30:13-0:30:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:30:13):**  And how can we create the conditions to expedite those processes?  
**[0:30:20-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:30:20):**  So nature is a moving bus.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:30:22):**  You just got to jump on.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:30:24):**  Nature spends her entire existence trying to grow a forest.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:30:27):**  That's literally what's going on.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:30:28):**  Like she's always like, how can I grow a forest today?  
**[0:30:31-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:30:31):**  And humans are just just like with a whack a mole.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:30:34):**  Like, no, no, we're not going to let you do that.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:30:39):**  So whatever we can do to create those enabling conditions for life, building soil, focusing  
**[0:30:45-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:30:45):**  on species recovery, I see a lot.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:30:48):**  I was contacted last week from a woman who, you know, there are a lot of do-gooders who  
**[0:30:53-0:30:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:30:53):**  are like, oh, I'm going to go to Africa and build a permaculture school.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:30:57):**  And she reached out to me and, you know, it's just like, I have about a, I want to get a  
**[0:31:02-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:31:02):**  hundred acres originally and then a thousand acres to do a food forest.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:31:07):**  And I was thinking, who invited you into the community?  
**[0:31:10-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:31:10):**  Which community?  
**[0:31:11-0:31:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:31:11):**  Who asked you to do this?  
**[0:31:14-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:31:14):**  It's really privileged when white people go to, you know, lesser developed countries or  
**[0:31:20-0:31:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:31:20):**  into the global south.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:31:21):**  I don't even like to use the word developed that slipped out into the global south and  
**[0:31:26-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:31:26):**  be like, I'm going to buy land here and do a thing.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:31:28):**  And I'm, you know, when I just have the privilege, I can just come and consume land and mine  
**[0:31:34-0:31:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:31:34):**  it for minerals and create food for us.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:31:36):**  So that was one thing was just sort of that attitude, which I do think is the type of  
**[0:31:40-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:31:40):**  green colonialism.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:31:43):**  And so there's no thousand acres in East Africa that doesn't belong to a community or, you  
**[0:31:49-0:31:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:31:49):**  know, you're, who are you displacing was my question by doing that with your great vision.  
**[0:31:55-0:32:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:31:55):**  Second, if you're talking about a food forest on a thousand acres, like what was the original  
**[0:32:00-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:32:00):**  forest that was there?  
**[0:32:02-0:32:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:32:02):**  Those original species.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:32:04):**  People do not understand that again, the original vegetation is dropping leafy matter, creating  
**[0:32:12-0:32:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:32:12):**  the biology that's creating the chemistry that has created the soil structures for millions  
**[0:32:16-0:32:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:32:16):**  of years.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:32:17):**  So don't start coming with mangoes and avocados, which we love, but that cannot be the alpha  
**[0:32:24-0:32:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:32:24):**  in a, in a, in a concept, especially on such a broad scale.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:32:28):**  So life affirming is about, you know, feeding soils.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:32:32):**  It's about you know, understanding which cycles are we trying to, to regenerate?  
**[0:32:39-0:32:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:32:39):**  How do we try to decrease our harmful?  
**[0:32:41-0:32:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:32:41):**  And I don't know saints, I live in an apartment and have electricity and, you know, have,  
**[0:32:46-0:32:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:32:46):**  I'm attached to degenerative things, right.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:32:50):**  But with your, my work or my communication or trying to share out, trying to inspire  
**[0:32:55-0:33:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:32:55):**  people to learn more about how they can be in relationship with their locality, with  
**[0:33:02-0:33:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:33:02):**  their bio region.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:33:05):**  So yeah, I'm sure there's some more spiritual, I'm not a very spiritual person, so I can't  
**[0:33:10-0:33:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:33:10):**  give you like a spiritual, you know, I don't know.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:33:14):**  That's okay.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:33:15):**  It doesn't have to come from that place.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:33:18):**  Yeah, I'm in the same boat.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:33:20):**  It's not where I draw most of my inspiration from.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:33:22):**  I'm much more practical.  
**[0:33:24-0:33:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:33:24):**  And you were talking about, you know, a model that is increasingly common and I've seen  
**[0:33:29-0:33:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:33:29):**  it in the global south.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:33:31):**  I've seen it in, you know, underprivileged communities that I've worked in.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:33:33):**  And I've also seen it in the United States and in Europe where people with greater means  
**[0:33:39-0:33:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:33:39):**  go into a place thinking that they have a solution without understanding the local community  
**[0:33:44-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:33:44):**  or the needs of the area or the history behind how it got there.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:33:48):**  And okay, now we're going to do rewilding on a place that used to be productive farms  
**[0:33:52-0:33:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:33:52):**  and that people relied upon for any countless number of supplies that, that fed into that  
**[0:33:58-0:34:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:33:58):**  community and kept it viable.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:34:00):**  And yeah, we could go into this a long time about how it's played out both at the small  
**[0:34:06-0:34:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:34:06):**  and the large scale.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:34:08):**  And it's caused a lot of animosity against ideas and concepts that are rooted in something  
**[0:34:14-0:34:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:34:14):**  really positive, but are really poorly executed because of a lack of understanding and a lack  
**[0:34:18-0:34:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:34:18):**  of communication with the people on site as to what they need, what they're trying to  
**[0:34:23-0:34:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:34:23):**  move towards.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:34:24):**  And in contrast to that, can you tell us about your own process when you are called into  
**[0:34:30-0:34:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:34:30):**  a community or invited to go, where do you start in order to make sure that your project  
**[0:34:35-0:34:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:34:35):**  is run from that understanding that's lacking in so many others?  
**[0:34:39-0:34:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:34:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:34:40):**  You know, my situation is unique because I have historically been working with large  
**[0:34:45-0:34:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:34:45):**  agencies that are invited in by disaster, right?  
**[0:34:50-0:34:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:34:50):**  So it's not like there's a community meeting that says, oh, gee whiz, you know, maybe we  
**[0:34:53-0:34:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:34:53):**  should reach out to the UN and see if they can do something here.  
**[0:34:56-0:34:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:34:56):**  No, it's usually like there's a disaster.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:34:59):**  We have a lot of people on the move.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:35:01):**  There's a need to set up camps and shelters and all this stuff.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:35:05):**  But we also work.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:35:07):**  I mean, I were working with forced displacement.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:35:11):**  There are different types of groups that we talk about.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:35:14):**  You have refugees who are people who have exited their country.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:35:18):**  You have IDPs, which are internally displaced people who didn't leave their country, but  
**[0:35:23-0:35:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:35:23):**  they went to a safer or drier or more food rich place or whatever that issue may be.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:35:30):**  And then you have returnees, people who are coming home to their place of origin.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:35:36):**  And then, of course, you have what's called the host community, but they don't self identify  
**[0:35:41-0:35:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:35:41):**  as the host community necessarily.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:35:43):**  They just are like, whoa, there's suddenly tens of thousands of people here and they're  
**[0:35:47-0:35:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:35:47):**  chopping down the trees that we want to chop down for fuel.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:35:51):**  And they're accessing our groundwater and our Grazeland.  
**[0:35:55-0:36:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:35:55):**  And so there's a potential for conflicts there, because oftentimes refugees are not sent to  
**[0:36:01-0:36:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:36:01):**  the prime real estate location.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:36:03):**  They're sent to places where camps and things are settlements are established in places  
**[0:36:09-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:36:09):**  where there's already not favorable land in a community where the services are already  
**[0:36:15-0:36:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:36:15):**  not necessarily meeting the full needs of the existing original community.  
**[0:36:20-0:36:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:36:20):**  But regardless, normally I'm called into a place to come and try to find a solution.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:36:26):**  I'm there for weeks at a time or coming in and out over a course of months, working with  
**[0:36:30-0:36:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:36:30):**  staff of NGOs, working with government, working with the community.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:36:36):**  And I always try to tell people, like, keep your eyes open and your mouth shut.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:36:40):**  I mean, you are there to ask questions.  
**[0:36:44-0:36:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:36:44):**  If I go to Kakuma refugee camp or Manana, Hawaii community, I know nothing about that  
**[0:36:50-0:36:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:36:50):**  context.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:36:51):**  I am not the expert.  
**[0:36:53-0:36:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:36:53):**  I know a few things, but I'm bringing them to a completely unknown context.  
**[0:36:58-0:37:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:36:58):**  Whereas the community are the consultants, right?  
**[0:37:01-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:37:01):**  Like they know the place, they know the issues, they know the way the water and energy flows.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:37:07):**  So it's really about coming and discussing with them, like, what have the changes been,  
**[0:37:13-0:37:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:37:13):**  figuring out what is the story of place?  
**[0:37:16-0:37:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:37:16):**  Where are we?  
**[0:37:17-0:37:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:37:17):**  What's going on here?  
**[0:37:18-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:37:18):**  How did it used to be?  
**[0:37:19-0:37:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:37:19):**  How is it now?  
**[0:37:20-0:37:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:37:20):**  How do you want it to be?  
**[0:37:21-0:37:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:37:21):**  Or if you had a magic wand.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:37:24):**  And then also inventorying all the ingredients of resilience around us, all the different  
**[0:37:28-0:37:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:37:28):**  ethnobotanical resources, the quote unquote waste streams, what kind of resources can  
**[0:37:35-0:37:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:37:35):**  we recover, whether those are organic or not organic.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:37:40):**  And also really engaging them in co design.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:37:44):**  So last week I was in South Sudan in a very flooded place, looking at flood zone food  
**[0:37:50-0:37:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:37:50):**  systems.  
**[0:37:51-0:37:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:37:51):**  And with the community, we were working actually with two different communities.  
**[0:37:57-0:37:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:37:57):**  Every step of the way, we're co designing.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:37:59):**  I'm asking, how do you do this?  
**[0:38:01-0:38:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:38:01):**  How do you, if you want to tie together bamboos, what do you use?  
**[0:38:04-0:38:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:38:04):**  They use mosquito nets that they shred.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:38:06):**  They work super well.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:38:07):**  So we created bamboo rafts for floating gardens.  
**[0:38:12-0:38:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:38:12):**  We also made a chinampa, like the Aztec chinampa.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:38:16):**  And that was totally co designed.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:38:17):**  Like once I sense that somebody is a champion, I'm like, I keep seeking myself for champions.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:38:22):**  If I figure out that somebody is like really interested in taking a lot of pride in their  
**[0:38:26-0:38:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:38:26):**  work, and they're super activated by what we're doing, and they've got some skills,  
**[0:38:30-0:38:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:38:30):**  I'm like, all right, you're the captain.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:38:32):**  Like you go like you own this and let me just try to ask questions.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:38:37):**  So the chinampa, at first we talked about making it four by eight feet or four by six,  
**[0:38:42-0:38:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:38:42):**  I mean, not feet meters.  
**[0:38:44-0:38:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:38:44):**  But then I'm asking, well, with this black cotton soil and all this clay, if the edges  
**[0:38:49-0:38:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:38:49):**  erode, then what?  
**[0:38:51-0:38:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:38:51):**  And they're like, okay, well, yeah, you're right.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:38:52):**  Let's make it bigger.  
**[0:38:53-0:38:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:38:53):**  So the whole time, we're just engineering and designing the things together, asking  
**[0:38:59-0:39:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:38:59):**  each other questions.  
**[0:39:00-0:39:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:39:00):**  We're all students, we are all teachers, and we come together and we're just going to make  
**[0:39:04-0:39:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:39:04):**  a thing and see if it works and test.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:39:06):**  So laboratory in that regard.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:39:08):**  Like these were some new things that we're trying to develop.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:39:12):**  So it depends on the context, but I am brought in from the like kind of top down situation  
**[0:39:17-0:39:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:39:17):**  if I'm coming in through a huge NGO or the UN.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:39:23):**  But I think for people who are trying to come into the space, I'm not even sure like, what  
**[0:39:30-0:39:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:39:30):**  I would do is you have to figure out who are the green local champions.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:39:33):**  I do have the privilege that I get these opportunities to talk with Oliver and other people, but  
**[0:39:39-0:39:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:39:39):**  there really are amazing champions here from East Africa.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:39:44):**  And so we have to be raising those green local voices.  
**[0:39:48-0:39:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:39:48):**  And again, that's a moving bus to jump on to figure out who are the champions who are  
**[0:39:53-0:39:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:39:53):**  actually doing accountable work, okay?  
**[0:39:57-0:40:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:39:57):**  If they're given money, can show you like, these are receipts, this is what we spent.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:40:02):**  And there's really a lot of transparency and accountability, but people who you can really  
**[0:40:05-0:40:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:40:05):**  see are really trying to do something and they just need a bit of support rather than  
**[0:40:10-0:40:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:40:10):**  people who have some grandiose vision and they're trying, or they talk a lot and it's  
**[0:40:17-0:40:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:40:17):**  not really clear what they achieve on the ground, but they're asking for money a lot.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:40:21):**  So those are the kinds of dynamics that I would be looking for if I were trying to do  
**[0:40:26-0:40:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:40:26):**  a project in a country that's not mine.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:40:28):**  Sure, sure.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:40:29):**  Those are some really good starting points, especially that dynamic of, you've got two  
**[0:40:35-0:40:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:40:35):**  eyes and one mouth, two ears, use them proportionally.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:40:39):**  I've always liked that one.  
**[0:40:43-0:40:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:40:43):**  And I would imagine too, that working with diverse communities, especially ones that  
**[0:40:49-0:40:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:40:49):**  are recently superimposed upon existing communities, dealing with the conflicts and the viewpoints,  
**[0:40:58-0:41:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:40:58):**  the things that disrupt cohesion, getting a consensus, getting people to work together  
**[0:41:04-0:41:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:41:04):**  is probably one of the original hurdles that you have to get over.  
**[0:41:10-0:41:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:41:10):**  And I'm wondering how you work with the members of different communities to try and get a  
**[0:41:15-0:41:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:41:15):**  consensus and get them rowing in the same direction, because it's essential for things  
**[0:41:19-0:41:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:41:19):**  to work and for things to remain viable once you're gone and in the long term.  
**[0:41:24-0:41:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:41:24):**  Yeah.  
**[0:41:25-0:41:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:41:25):**  So as of coming back to the story of place, I mean, I'm just there to listen and learn,  
**[0:41:29-0:41:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:41:29):**  and there's not really a need to build consensus because they're sharing their story and they  
**[0:41:34-0:41:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:41:34):**  share out like, you know, people will say in this community, we used to have a lot of  
**[0:41:39-0:41:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:41:39):**  trees everywhere and water was cleaner.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:41:44):**  Animals were healthier.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:41:45):**  Humans had more food and health.  
**[0:41:47-0:41:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:41:47):**  Animals had more food and health.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:41:49):**  And there's been a disruption.  
**[0:41:51-0:41:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:41:51):**  Now we have disasters.  
**[0:41:53-0:41:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:41:53):**  We have extreme water events.  
**[0:41:54-0:42:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:41:54):**  We have periods of hunger.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:42:01):**  And what we would like in the future is to return to a state of stability.  
**[0:42:05-0:42:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:42:05):**  And so like that doesn't take convincing.  
**[0:42:08-0:42:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:42:08):**  And it's not my job to convince.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:42:12):**  They are very articulate and able to spell out what the challenges are that they have,  
**[0:42:18-0:42:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:42:18):**  the problems that they face.  
**[0:42:19-0:42:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:42:19):**  And so then we discuss solutions and then we just move forward.  
**[0:42:22-0:42:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:42:22):**  So again, I'm not trying to come with I don't even really have like a curriculum.  
**[0:42:28-0:42:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:42:28):**  And I wouldn't say I'm a permaculture trainer.  
**[0:42:30-0:42:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:42:30):**  I don't know what I would call myself, but I mean, I've got a bunch of things that I've  
**[0:42:34-0:42:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:42:34):**  learned from courses and books and studying and YouTube videos.  
**[0:42:38-0:42:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:42:38):**  And if I come to a context and I can make connections, you know, we all are making connections  
**[0:42:44-0:42:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:42:44):**  together and problem solving based on our experiential capital and our educational capital  
**[0:42:51-0:42:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:42:51):**  and knowledge capital.  
**[0:42:52-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:42:52):**  So I don't remember the question.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:43:01):**  Getting consensus and getting people to work together who maybe are coming from a place  
**[0:43:04-0:43:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:43:04):**  of conflict in the beginning.  
**[0:43:06-0:43:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:43:06):**  Oh, well, I mean, so I also don't work in isolation.  
**[0:43:10-0:43:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:43:10):**  Like I'm working on larger teams.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:43:12):**  You know, maybe there's there are people who do wash programming, water sanitation and  
**[0:43:16-0:43:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:43:16):**  hygiene.  
**[0:43:17-0:43:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:43:17):**  Some people that focus on peace building and conflict mitigation, people who work on gender  
**[0:43:22-0:43:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:43:22):**  and sexual and gender based violence.  
**[0:43:24-0:43:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:43:24):**  Some people work on governance.  
**[0:43:26-0:43:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:43:26):**  So I'm not there to like, you know, like I'll give you an example.  
**[0:43:31-0:43:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:43:31):**  We just made floating rafts in South Sudan.  
**[0:43:33-0:43:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:43:33):**  I told the team very clearly I can figure out the physics and the biology like we can  
**[0:43:37-0:43:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:43:37):**  make it float and make it grow food.  
**[0:43:40-0:43:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:43:40):**  But if people are going to be stealing the food or still picking apart the bamboo's for  
**[0:43:44-0:43:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:43:44):**  the rafts because they need to sell those, I can't in a three week period solve that  
**[0:43:48-0:43:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:43:48):**  part.  
**[0:43:49-0:43:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:43:49):**  So I can do the physics and the biology.  
**[0:43:51-0:43:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:43:51):**  We all have to do the governance and the human part and work with communities.  
**[0:43:55-0:43:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:43:55):**  And usually our teams are from that community.  
**[0:43:58-0:44:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:43:58):**  So it's not an outside thing.  
**[0:44:00-0:44:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:44:00):**  I'm usually the only or if Warren's with me, we're the only sort of people from outside.  
**[0:44:05-0:44:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:44:05):**  Well, that's not true.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:44:07):**  We also have other like African staff from other neighboring countries.  
**[0:44:12-0:44:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:44:12):**  But usually the team that's working directly with the community are from that community.  
**[0:44:16-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:44:16):**  And then we create WhatsApp groups.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:44:19):**  Right.  
**[0:44:20-0:44:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:44:20):**  And I do pictures all day long and little drawings and videos.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:44:23):**  And I do a lot of remote mentoring and support however I can.  
**[0:44:29-0:44:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:44:29):**  So, you know, but culturally and with conflict, you know, like, for example, in Burundi, when  
**[0:44:37-0:44:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:44:37):**  we did that project, we had a very mixed community.  
**[0:44:39-0:44:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:44:39):**  We had returnees, we had IDPs, we had host community members.  
**[0:44:45-0:44:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:44:45):**  But the thing is, is that we're trying to I think it's a bit of a nostalgic process  
**[0:44:51-0:44:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:44:51):**  for people, because when we start to do these low tech interventions, people always will  
**[0:44:58-0:45:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:44:58):**  say, oh, I remember this.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:45:00):**  My grandfather used to do this or this is how my grandmother I remember her burying  
**[0:45:06-0:45:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:45:06):**  food waste or burying slaughter waste.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:45:09):**  And so they trust that because they're like, wait a minute, this is familiar.  
**[0:45:13-0:45:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:45:13):**  This is simple.  
**[0:45:14-0:45:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:45:14):**  This is self-reliance.  
**[0:45:16-0:45:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:45:16):**  This is I remember this is how my community was always self-reliant and resilient in Yemen.  
**[0:45:22-0:45:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:45:22):**  I talked about the Quran.  
**[0:45:24-0:45:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:45:24):**  Let's build Quranic nurseries and Quranic food for us.  
**[0:45:28-0:45:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:45:28):**  You know, like whatever is listed in the Quran, like wavas and pomegranates and apricots and  
**[0:45:33-0:45:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:45:33):**  almonds, everything, all those things, they will grow in Yemen.  
**[0:45:37-0:45:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:45:37):**  OK, so people really loved that same in Somalia, same kind of climate.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:45:41):**  So they're like, what I are, holy Quran is going to make us resilient.  
**[0:45:44-0:45:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:45:44):**  And so it's just a matter of trying to understand what you know, what people value and how can  
**[0:45:49-0:45:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:45:49):**  we help to explain things in a way that really makes sense in their context and meeting people  
**[0:45:55-0:45:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:45:55):**  where they are.  
**[0:45:56-0:45:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:45:56):**  Yeah, that makes so much sense.  
**[0:45:58-0:46:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:45:58):**  And I like what you were talking about as well, of creating small, fast feedback loop  
**[0:46:05-0:46:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:46:05):**  projects that you can gain new information from, especially when you're new to a place.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:46:10):**  And one of the things that actually I was speaking about with Mora Gamble on the previous  
**[0:46:14-0:46:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:46:14):**  episode was that there is sort of an assumption if you haven't worked with these communities,  
**[0:46:20-0:46:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:46:20):**  that there's a whole bunch of latent and dormant information, knowledge of the land, you know,  
**[0:46:29-0:46:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:46:29):**  all these things that have been passed down.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:46:31):**  Whereas in a lot of cases, this isn't the case anymore.  
**[0:46:34-0:46:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:46:34):**  That knowledge has been broken through bad information, colonialization, loss over generations  
**[0:46:40-0:46:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:46:40):**  through displacement.  
**[0:46:42-0:46:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:46:42):**  And though they may have a sense of what can work and something in their memory of how  
**[0:46:47-0:46:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:46:47):**  their their ancestors used to do it, it doesn't necessarily match with what they've been taught  
**[0:46:52-0:46:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:46:52):**  up until that point.  
**[0:46:53-0:47:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:46:53):**  And so finding a way of connecting with the familiar and the indigenous knowledge, while  
**[0:47:00-0:47:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:47:00):**  also bringing in new ideas that can help make that bridge and apply it in a more modern  
**[0:47:04-0:47:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:47:04):**  or local context, and then applying it and testing it in small, manageable sizes that  
**[0:47:11-0:47:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:47:11):**  are low risk, don't require a lot of investment.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:47:14):**  Is that a fair assessment of kind of the process of getting a project going in a lot of these  
**[0:47:19-0:47:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:47:19):**  places?  
**[0:47:20-0:47:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:47:20):**  Oh, it depends.  
**[0:47:21-0:47:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:47:21):**  I mean, there's so many different actors working on so many different types of scale.  
**[0:47:27-0:47:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:47:27):**  But yeah, there is a lot for all of us, there's a lot of unlearning that needs to happen,  
**[0:47:31-0:47:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:47:31):**  right?  
**[0:47:32-0:47:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:47:32):**  Yeah, we have been really hardwired and programmed.  
**[0:47:35-0:47:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:47:35):**  And I mean, there are reasons for that.  
**[0:47:38-0:47:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:47:38):**  Right.  
**[0:47:39-0:47:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:47:39):**  Food is something you're supposed to buy, not care about how it's produced.  
**[0:47:44-0:47:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:47:44):**  And so I mean, whether I'm in Turkana, Kenya, or I'm in Oklahoma, like people have received  
**[0:47:50-0:47:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:47:50):**  wrong information for a reason, right?  
**[0:47:53-0:47:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:47:53):**  There are special interests behind what you know, you always have to ask, in whose interest  
**[0:47:57-0:48:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:47:57):**  is it that I am learning the things the way that I'm learning them.  
**[0:48:01-0:48:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:48:01):**  And so, but, you know, as Warren always says, and we always say in our trainings is three  
**[0:48:06-0:48:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:48:06):**  ways to get people to get on board and, you know, be really persuaded into your approach.  
**[0:48:13-0:48:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:48:13):**  Number one is the, you know, maybe the most important and that is demonstration, people  
**[0:48:18-0:48:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:48:18):**  will only believe what they can see with their real eyes, unless it's religious, but then  
**[0:48:25-0:48:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:48:25):**  number two is demonstration.  
**[0:48:28-0:48:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:48:28):**  Okay, that is the way that people are going to see it, believe it.  
**[0:48:33-0:48:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:48:33):**  And number three, of course, is demonstration.  
**[0:48:35-0:48:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:48:35):**  So demonstration, demonstration, demonstration, you can talk all day long, and you can tell  
**[0:48:41-0:48:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:48:41):**  people that chemicals are bad, you can talk about the, you know, GMOs, you can do a lot  
**[0:48:46-0:48:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:48:46):**  of talking.  
**[0:48:47-0:48:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:48:47):**  But what we do is like the first thing we do is we make two little side by side miniature  
**[0:48:54-0:48:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:48:54):**  farms.  
**[0:48:56-0:48:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:48:56):**  And I even use, you know, like little tools.  
**[0:48:59-0:49:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:48:59):**  But you know, we will make like little miniature a frame.  
**[0:49:04-0:49:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:49:04):**  This is actually from this one is from Burundi.  
**[0:49:07-0:49:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:49:07):**  So we made a little miniature farm side by side too.  
**[0:49:11-0:49:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:49:11):**  And so like, one will be like, Oh, this is Oliver's farm.  
**[0:49:14-0:49:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:49:14):**  And Oliver just spends all day drinking tea.  
**[0:49:17-0:49:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:49:17):**  And then he doesn't pay attention to the land and soil.  
**[0:49:21-0:49:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:49:21):**  And he comes and tills all the land and sweeps up all the organic matter and then burns it.  
**[0:49:26-0:49:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:49:26):**  And we actually take a pile of leaves and set it on fire.  
**[0:49:30-0:49:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:49:30):**  And then Oh, here's Natalie's farm.  
**[0:49:32-0:49:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:49:32):**  She's resilient.  
**[0:49:33-0:49:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:49:33):**  And she and we make little we take this little miniature a frame, we make little swales,  
**[0:49:39-0:49:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:49:39):**  we do some stone mulching, we plant little trees, this is a tiny little model.  
**[0:49:44-0:49:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:49:44):**  And then we cover the whole thing with mulch.  
**[0:49:46-0:49:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:49:46):**  And then we put we start to pretend there's like a rainstorm, and everybody's snapping  
**[0:49:50-0:49:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:49:50):**  their fingers and making thunder noises.  
**[0:49:53-0:49:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:49:53):**  And we pour water all over both of the farms.  
**[0:49:57-0:50:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:49:57):**  Usually these are hot locations with high sun and heat.  
**[0:50:01-0:50:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:50:01):**  As soon as we've done that, and soaked both farms equally, immediately you see Oliver's  
**[0:50:06-0:50:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:50:06):**  farm is losing all this water, right?  
**[0:50:08-0:50:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:50:08):**  Water is just streaming off and causing a flooding and all the other farms, Natalie's  
**[0:50:13-0:50:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:50:13):**  farm and I, you know, Joe, because we try to always make it funny and pick on people  
**[0:50:17-0:50:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:50:17):**  in the city.  
**[0:50:19-0:50:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:50:19):**  But this farm, the resilient farm is retaining water, and then we have a temperature gun,  
**[0:50:25-0:50:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:50:25):**  and then we'll come back in the afternoon or in the next day.  
**[0:50:28-0:50:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:50:28):**  And already, there's so much to observe all of the organic mulch is you can see there's  
**[0:50:33-0:50:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:50:33):**  termites and ants and all these people under there already starting to break it all down.  
**[0:50:38-0:50:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:50:38):**  Immediately it's cool, you know, you can see that that soil has remained cool.  
**[0:50:42-0:50:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:50:42):**  There's still moisture in there was you know, the dry farm, the non resilient farm is desiccated  
**[0:50:48-0:50:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:50:48):**  and hot and crusted over and already dry.  
**[0:50:51-0:50:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:50:51):**  So already, they're just like, got it, hold my beer, doing it.  
**[0:50:57-0:50:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:50:57):**  Hold my local brew.  
**[0:50:58-0:51:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:50:58):**  So yeah, I mean, little demonstrations like that are so important, right?  
**[0:51:03-0:51:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:51:03):**  And connecting with multiple senses, getting people involved in that fast feedback loop,  
**[0:51:08-0:51:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:51:08):**  a couple of examples of exactly how this would play out on a larger scale can really click  
**[0:51:15-0:51:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:51:15):**  with people who would then I get it if you just talk about it and you go into soil biology  
**[0:51:19-0:51:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:51:19):**  too fast.  
**[0:51:20-0:51:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:51:20):**  And you start talking about theory and design science from the beginning.  
**[0:51:25-0:51:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:51:25):**  Have you got any other activities like that, that you've noticed really connect with people  
**[0:51:29-0:51:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:51:29):**  right away?  
**[0:51:31-0:51:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:51:31):**  Well, I think just the virtue of doing the practical training.  
**[0:51:36-0:51:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:51:36):**  So you know, we have, we'll have the team, the staff of the NGO with with the community  
**[0:51:43-0:51:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:51:43):**  side by side.  
**[0:51:45-0:51:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:51:45):**  And I always say this is not a workshop, it is a work hard shop.  
**[0:51:49-0:51:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:51:49):**  So we are all in there, you know, getting blisters working hard people like well, what  
**[0:51:54-0:51:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:51:54):**  should I bring to the training?  
**[0:51:55-0:51:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:51:55):**  I'm like bring gumboots and Panadol or aspirin.  
**[0:51:59-0:52:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:51:59):**  That's all you need.  
**[0:52:00-0:52:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:52:00):**  We provide the tools and we're all out there.  
**[0:52:03-0:52:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:52:03):**  We try to have fun.  
**[0:52:04-0:52:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:52:04):**  We play music, we sing, but we're digging.  
**[0:52:07-0:52:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:52:07):**  We're doing citizen engineering and everybody's switched on everybody's got, you know, doing  
**[0:52:12-0:52:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:52:12):**  something.  
**[0:52:13-0:52:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:52:13):**  Normally we create teams.  
**[0:52:14-0:52:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:52:14):**  So like if we're creating a sponge farm or a permagarden, you know, I'll figure out who  
**[0:52:20-0:52:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:52:20):**  the champions are.  
**[0:52:21-0:52:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:52:21):**  We break into teams and we have a lot of different captains and then I walk around from team  
**[0:52:27-0:52:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:52:27):**  to team to team and give feedback and just keep going and providing technical input,  
**[0:52:32-0:52:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:52:32):**  making sure that things are to a standard and then we'll pause and then sort of rotate  
**[0:52:37-0:52:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:52:37):**  and make sure like we'll all go to every station and explain and talk about, oh, this is how  
**[0:52:42-0:52:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:52:42):**  we make smile burns.  
**[0:52:43-0:52:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:52:43):**  This is how we measure a swale on contour.  
**[0:52:44-0:52:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:52:44):**  This is how we build a frames.  
**[0:52:46-0:52:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:52:46):**  So it's really important.  
**[0:52:48-0:52:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:52:48):**  You can't just do this in a conference hall, right?  
**[0:52:51-0:52:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:52:51):**  People have to build a muscle memory.  
**[0:52:55-0:53:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:52:55):**  And then miraculously, I think I don't know how many trainings I've done with Warren,  
**[0:53:01-0:53:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:53:01):**  Somalia, Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya, and without fail, every single one except for Somalia,  
**[0:53:09-0:53:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:53:09):**  it rained on the last day.  
**[0:53:10-0:53:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:53:10):**  So like even in the middle of the dry season, there'll be like this freak, you know, active  
**[0:53:16-0:53:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:53:16):**  force majeure and we suddenly will get a rainstorm and all the swales fill up and we have to  
**[0:53:21-0:53:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:53:21):**  start to fill and spill into all the structures and people are like, holy crap, I get it,  
**[0:53:25-0:53:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:53:25):**  you know?  
**[0:53:26-0:53:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:53:26):**  So seeing with your own eyes and also seeing immediately how productive, like when we make  
**[0:53:32-0:53:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:53:32):**  double dug beds, within three days, we've got sprouts of amaranth.  
**[0:53:36-0:53:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:53:36):**  Within three weeks, people can be harvesting.  
**[0:53:38-0:53:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:53:38):**  There's not a lot of convincing needed, you know, like they get it.  
**[0:53:45-0:53:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:53:45):**  For sure.  
**[0:53:47-0:53:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:53:47):**  And have you started to see any emerging patterns from all of the diverse communities that you've  
**[0:53:51-0:53:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:53:51):**  worked with about the things that make these projects succeed in the long run and those  
**[0:53:58-0:54:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:53:58):**  that start to fall apart after a couple of, you know, demonstrations?  
**[0:54:03-0:54:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:54:03):**  Yeah.  
**[0:54:04-0:54:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:54:04):**  I mean, I don't claim, sometimes I get nervous because people are like, oh, we want to interview  
**[0:54:08-0:54:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:54:08):**  you and I'm like, I don't know.  
**[0:54:11-0:54:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:54:11):**  I don't want to oversell the successes that we've had.  
**[0:54:14-0:54:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:54:14):**  Right.  
**[0:54:15-0:54:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:54:15):**  There's a lot of failures.  
**[0:54:16-0:54:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:54:16):**  It's still an and I think the regenerative movement altogether, there's still a lot of  
**[0:54:21-0:54:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:54:21):**  laboratory happening and building of evidence base.  
**[0:54:24-0:54:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:54:24):**  Like, I think that's one of the major challenges is how do we battle with information?  
**[0:54:28-0:54:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:54:28):**  So, you know, if you're working with a community, whether that's in your own hometown or elsewhere,  
**[0:54:37-0:54:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:54:37):**  people don't understand the science and it's not always intuitive for them.  
**[0:54:42-0:54:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:54:42):**  So following up, continue to repeat a lot of simple, basic ideas.  
**[0:54:48-0:54:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:54:48):**  Keep it simple.  
**[0:54:49-0:54:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:54:49):**  I would say try to keep it simple.  
**[0:54:51-0:54:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:54:51):**  I say here, like here we throughout East Africa, people eat a sort of a maize meal, which is  
**[0:54:57-0:55:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:54:57):**  called either ugali or pochon.  
**[0:55:01-0:55:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:55:01):**  And that's like a big staple that every a lot of communities eat.  
**[0:55:05-0:55:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:55:05):**  So I always tell them the soil is a stomach and every day needs pocho, pocho, pocho.  
**[0:55:10-0:55:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:55:10):**  So you have to keep feeding the soil.  
**[0:55:13-0:55:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:55:13):**  And you know, that's with organic mulches and living mulches and things like that.  
**[0:55:19-0:55:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:55:19):**  So just really trying to break it down to some basic.  
**[0:55:23-0:55:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:55:23):**  And I'm not saying that this is only for the global south or communities whose you know,  
**[0:55:27-0:55:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:55:27):**  this is for everyone.  
**[0:55:29-0:55:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:55:29):**  You know, we're not we're not carbon literate.  
**[0:55:31-0:55:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:55:31):**  We're not soil literate enough.  
**[0:55:34-0:55:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:55:34):**  So also having a temperature gun and some other basic tools is really telling.  
**[0:55:39-0:55:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:55:39):**  Like I made a video a few last week in South Sudan, which I was so surprised that suddenly  
**[0:55:45-0:55:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:55:45):**  had like 10,000 views where I just had the temperature gun and I was in a field that  
**[0:55:51-0:55:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:55:51):**  was totally desertifying.  
**[0:55:52-0:55:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:55:52):**  And it's, you know, I called it Stumpville because it's like a graveyard of, you know,  
**[0:55:58-0:55:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:55:58):**  tree stumps.  
**[0:55:59-0:56:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:55:59):**  And I just pointed my temperature gun.  
**[0:56:00-0:56:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:56:00):**  I think the highest temperature was clocked.  
**[0:56:02-0:56:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:56:02):**  It was like 69 degrees Celsius.  
**[0:56:05-0:56:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:56:05):**  And there was one tree in the whole place.  
**[0:56:07-0:56:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:56:07):**  I don't know how it survived from being chopped down, but in the shade of that tree, it was  
**[0:56:12-0:56:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:56:12):**  40 something degrees Celsius.  
**[0:56:15-0:56:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:56:15):**  It was definitely more than 25 percent degrees, just two meters away from each other.  
**[0:56:21-0:56:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:56:21):**  So when people see that, they're like, wow, I had no idea how hot it is.  
**[0:56:24-0:56:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:56:24):**  And we say the you know, the word human comes from the word humus.  
**[0:56:29-0:56:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:56:29):**  The soil is like a human.  
**[0:56:30-0:56:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:56:30):**  It should have the same temperature.  
**[0:56:32-0:56:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:56:32):**  It should have the same hydration.  
**[0:56:33-0:56:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:56:33):**  It should have the same protection and food.  
**[0:56:36-0:56:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:56:36):**  So just treat the soil like you do your baby, you know.  
**[0:56:41-0:56:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:56:41):**  So if you I mean, however, your pet cat, whichever you love more.  
**[0:56:51-0:56:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:56:51):**  And OK, so what are some of the other useful tools you mentioned the heat gun being able  
**[0:56:56-0:56:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:56:56):**  to take readings on site?  
**[0:56:58-0:57:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:56:58):**  What are some of the other things you always have with you?  
**[0:57:02-0:57:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:57:02):**  A refractometer.  
**[0:57:04-0:57:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:57:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:57:05-0:57:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:57:05):**  So just showing, especially for NGOs that are focusing on nutrition security, just to  
**[0:57:11-0:57:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:57:11):**  demonstrate that the sugar content and nutrient content of individual plants can actually  
**[0:57:16-0:57:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:57:16):**  be measured very simply.  
**[0:57:19-0:57:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:57:19):**  You can have a pH monitor.  
**[0:57:22-0:57:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:57:22):**  So just, you know, either for soil, there's one for soil, there's one for water.  
**[0:57:26-0:57:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:57:26):**  And though alkalinity of water is also a really critical thing, right, in terms of this is  
**[0:57:30-0:57:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:57:30):**  why it's so important to possibly harvest rainwater.  
**[0:57:34-0:57:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:57:34):**  Rainwater is acidic.  
**[0:57:36-0:57:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:57:36):**  It chelates the minerals in the soil parent material that, you know, like little tiny  
**[0:57:41-0:57:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:57:41):**  jackhammers bursting open the soil so that those minerals can be bioavailable to plants.  
**[0:57:47-0:57:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:57:47):**  If you're just putting alkaline, alkaline water, you're you're totally not optimizing  
**[0:57:52-0:57:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:57:52):**  the nutrient potential of the food.  
**[0:57:56-0:57:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:57:56):**  Apne eye level.  
**[0:57:57-0:58:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:57:57):**  I would sometimes have my an eye level because you can quickly start to get a sense of the  
**[0:58:06-0:58:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:58:06):**  natural contours and patterns of the land.  
**[0:58:09-0:58:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:58:09):**  I like to make a human swale.  
**[0:58:11-0:58:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:58:11):**  So when we make an A-frame, you know, we train everybody how to make an A-frame.  
**[0:58:16-0:58:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:58:16):**  The calibration part is always a challenge for people.  
**[0:58:20-0:58:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:58:20):**  Like we just always want to make sure that we do that well and that people are calibrating  
**[0:58:25-0:58:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:58:25):**  every time they're using it because a goat will stand on the A-frame.  
**[0:58:28-0:58:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:58:28):**  And I always say there's three themes of water.  
**[0:58:32-0:58:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:58:32):**  Number one, sun is the thief of water.  
**[0:58:35-0:58:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:58:35):**  Number two, wind and evaporation.  
**[0:58:37-0:58:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:58:37):**  And number three, number three, gravity and slope.  
**[0:58:40-0:58:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:58:40):**  Right.  
**[0:58:41-0:58:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:58:41):**  So sun, wind and slope.  
**[0:58:42-0:58:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:58:42):**  Those are the three ways that your water and soil moisture will leave.  
**[0:58:46-0:58:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:58:46):**  But the fourth one is your uncalibrated A-frame.  
**[0:58:53-0:58:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:58:53):**  Just like quantum physics, like if your A-frame is a little bit off across a long landscape,  
**[0:58:58-0:59:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:58:58):**  you're creating a drain and not a contour elevation trench.  
**[0:59:05-0:59:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:59:05):**  So we do that and then I was going to say, oh, yeah.  
**[0:59:13-0:59:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:59:13):**  So when we break into teams and every team gets a name.  
**[0:59:16-0:59:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:59:16):**  We try to make it a little competitive.  
**[0:59:17-0:59:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:59:17):**  I mean, I grew up as an immigrant, you know, only child.  
**[0:59:21-0:59:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:59:21):**  So I don't really know how to be competitive, but I try to pretend.  
**[0:59:24-0:59:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:59:24):**  So we make A-frames and then I tell every team, go and mark out starting from this point,  
**[0:59:32-0:59:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:59:32):**  which do you think is the contour starting from this point?  
**[0:59:37-0:59:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:59:37):**  So just with your eyeball, try to measure, you know, figure out where's the natural contour  
**[0:59:42-0:59:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:59:42):**  of this land.  
**[0:59:43-0:59:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:59:43):**  So every team is going in different directions and then they see, whoa, and then we measure  
**[0:59:49-0:59:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:59:49):**  with the A-frame and they're like, oh my God, we're completely off.  
**[0:59:52-0:59:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:59:52):**  So I try to have little tiny sayings like the eye will lie, the rule is use a tool or,  
**[0:59:58-1:00:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:59:58):**  you know, those kind of little peg mnemonics that can help people remember.  
**[1:00:04-1:00:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:00:04):**  People really think they can see contour with their eyes.  
**[1:00:06-1:00:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:00:06):**  We just can't.  
**[1:00:07-1:00:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:00:07):**  We're just, our brains are not calibrated that way.  
**[1:00:11-1:00:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:00:11):**  The other thing that we do is like, once we've mapped out the whole long contour, we'll get  
**[1:00:17-1:00:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:00:17):**  like 50 or a hundred people to stand and join hands all along that contour.  
**[1:00:23-1:00:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:00:23):**  So you really get a visual, a visualization of that same elevation and that contour across  
**[1:00:28-1:00:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:00:28):**  the landscape, which might totally defy what you had imagined.  
**[1:00:34-1:00:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:00:34):**  So yeah, I mean, you know, we just get, we just use whatever's around us to try to describe  
**[1:00:41-1:00:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:00:41):**  concepts in different ways.  
**[1:00:42-1:00:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:00:42):**  Yeah, that resourcefulness is so key.  
**[1:00:45-1:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:00:45):**  And what are some of the things that you have learned that you've picked up maybe in the  
**[1:00:50-1:00:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:00:50):**  last few years or recently in the activities and the projects that you've done that were  
**[1:00:54-1:00:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:00:54):**  that were new to you or that perhaps didn't come out of the courses that you took?  
**[1:00:58-1:01:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:00:58):**  Well, the failures, you know, so a lot of, well, that can be answered so many ways, a  
**[1:01:05-1:01:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:01:05):**  lot of knowledge around the indigenous and local resources.  
**[1:01:10-1:01:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:01:10):**  So, you know, we will always do a resource walk where the NGO team is on a team with  
**[1:01:17-1:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:01:17):**  the community.  
**[1:01:18-1:01:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:01:18):**  They're all one team, but we break them into smaller teams.  
**[1:01:21-1:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:01:21):**  So every team will go out for like 20 minutes with a bucket or pail and collect all kinds  
**[1:01:26-1:01:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:01:26):**  of resources.  
**[1:01:27-1:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:01:27):**  And then we come back in a circle.  
**[1:01:29-1:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:01:29):**  Everybody lays down all the resources in the center of the circle and we will spend two  
**[1:01:34-1:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:01:34):**  or three hours like, and every like we just go one person at a time.  
**[1:01:39-1:01:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:01:39):**  We'll talk about, oh, what is this resource?  
**[1:01:41-1:01:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:01:41):**  This is what we use it for.  
**[1:01:43-1:01:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:01:43):**  And it's interesting because sometimes we have had host communities and like displaced  
**[1:01:49-1:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:01:49):**  communities together in one circle.  
**[1:01:51-1:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:01:51):**  And one mom will be like, we use this green plant for our baby's stomach problems when  
**[1:01:57-1:01:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:01:57):**  they have diarrhea.  
**[1:01:58-1:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:01:58):**  And then, you know, the person from South Sudan will be like, are you serious?  
**[1:02:03-1:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:02:03):**  We use that same thing for like brushing teeth or, you know, I always tell the story.  
**[1:02:07-1:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:02:07):**  There was one woman who held up this cactus and she said, this is a very useful resource.  
**[1:02:13-1:02:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:02:13):**  We if you have a blemish or like some skin thing, you know, you can squeeze the juice  
**[1:02:18-1:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:02:18):**  and just apply it on your skin to like remove acne and blemishes.  
**[1:02:23-1:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:02:23):**  Or if the hyenas are disturbing your livestock, your camels or whatever, you just dip this  
**[1:02:29-1:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:02:29):**  cactus in blood and throw it to the hyena and they eat it and die.  
**[1:02:33-1:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:02:33):**  So there's just this really interesting come out and then we'll say like, oh, this is a  
**[1:02:41-1:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:02:41):**  plastic jerry can like a 20 liter jerry can.  
**[1:02:43-1:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:02:43):**  What can this be used for?  
**[1:02:44-1:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:02:44):**  And then people will say, oh, you could use it for this or you could use it for drip irrigation  
**[1:02:48-1:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:02:48):**  or you can, you know, so we just really try to expand our imagination and knowledge around  
**[1:02:53-1:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:02:53):**  all the usefulness of all the things around us.  
**[1:02:56-1:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:02:56):**  And that's an important exercise because oftentimes people are given the impression by the humanitarian  
**[1:03:03-1:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:03:03):**  community that you're poor, you have nothing, you depend on us and we know what you need.  
**[1:03:07-1:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:03:07):**  And when we do this exercise, they're like, wow, we actually are really wealthy.  
**[1:03:13-1:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:03:13):**  We have so many things here and it's always a really rich exchange of knowledge.  
**[1:03:18-1:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:03:18):**  And you know, because you have kids sitting with old people as they're talking about,  
**[1:03:23-1:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:03:23):**  oh, in my, when I was a child, we used to use this and that's not a common exercise,  
**[1:03:28-1:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:03:28):**  you know?  
**[1:03:29-1:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:03:29):**  So there's so much sharing and learning that is extracted from that, that the community  
**[1:03:34-1:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:03:34):**  benefits from not only us as trainers or whoever.  
**[1:03:38-1:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:03:38):**  And you know, but, you know, so that's always a really important exercise.  
**[1:03:43-1:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:03:43):**  A lot of stuff, a lot of learnings around not doing appropriate community engagement,  
**[1:03:48-1:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:03:48):**  you know, like you come back to a community and you're like, why would you have done that?  
**[1:03:53-1:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:03:53):**  Why did you put the berm on the uphill side of the swale?  
**[1:03:59-1:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:03:59):**  Because gravity, like, you know, so you're just like, wow, I never thought that you would  
**[1:04:04-1:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:04:04):**  have taken this knowledge or skill and translated it into this completely ineffective way.  
**[1:04:10-1:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:04:10):**  So again, like regular follow up regular.  
**[1:04:15-1:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:04:15):**  And that, by the way, was one of our civil engineers that did that project.  
**[1:04:19-1:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:04:19):**  Anyway, I thought like physics was part of civil engineering, but maybe not.  
**[1:04:28-1:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:04:28):**  Another time, you know, we made a huge swale, a big primary swale for flood mitigation in  
**[1:04:33-1:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:04:33):**  a community, but the men kept bringing coming over the berm with animals and it created  
**[1:04:39-1:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:04:39):**  a low point and a weak spot in the berm.  
**[1:04:41-1:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:04:41):**  And when the whole thing's filled up, the berm broke and you had a whole new gully that  
**[1:04:48-1:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:04:48):**  was forming.  
**[1:04:49-1:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:04:49):**  So we came back, we adapted that berm with a pond.  
**[1:04:53-1:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:04:53):**  We're like, okay, you know, we recognize now that this water will be useful for livestock  
**[1:04:58-1:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:04:58):**  watering.  
**[1:04:59-1:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:04:59):**  Why don't we actually create, you know, respond to that and create a designated place with  
**[1:05:04-1:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:05:04):**  a big dam where you can take the animals.  
**[1:05:07-1:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:05:07):**  And you know, so it's, you know, permaculture is about taking, accepting feedback, starting  
**[1:05:13-1:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:05:13):**  small, all of those apply.  
**[1:05:17-1:05:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:05:17):**  Absolutely.  
**[1:05:18-1:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:05:18):**  We sort of got into this before we started with the interview, and I know this is going  
**[1:05:22-1:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:05:22):**  to be a big question for you.  
**[1:05:23-1:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:05:23):**  You've got a lot to say on how people can start to contribute to this space who are  
**[1:05:28-1:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:05:28):**  interested in doing the type of work that you are doing.  
**[1:05:32-1:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:05:32):**  There's probably a lot of misconceptions about what your job description actually is and  
**[1:05:36-1:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:05:36):**  where they need to go to be effective and actually start applying it.  
**[1:05:40-1:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:05:40):**  Okay.  
**[1:05:42-1:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:05:42):**  So I do see a trend that, you know, regenerative approaches are exciting because we actually  
**[1:05:49-1:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:05:49):**  have solutions to a lot of the problems that we're facing as a global family.  
**[1:05:55-1:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:05:55):**  But a lot of times I see people just wanting to be do-gooders, which no one's going to  
**[1:06:00-1:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:06:00):**  blame you for that, but it's almost creating a sense of white, a new green colonialism  
**[1:06:07-1:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:06:07):**  and white, like green saviorism, like white green savior.  
**[1:06:12-1:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:06:12):**  And that's a bit, that can be bothersome.  
**[1:06:14-1:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:06:14):**  And I know that a lot of East African people would echo that, right?  
**[1:06:19-1:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:06:19):**  Like here-  
**[1:06:20-1:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:06:20):**  Like Guatemalans and Filipinos and Senegalese, yeah.  
**[1:06:23-1:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:06:23):**  Exactly.  
**[1:06:24-1:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:06:24):**  They're like, oh God, here they come again with now like a new thing that we're supposed  
**[1:06:27-1:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:06:27):**  to do, you know, conventional agriculture and now they want us to do something else.  
**[1:06:32-1:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:06:32):**  Can we go back to our traditional things?  
**[1:06:34-1:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:06:34):**  So I would just say that, first of all, people ask me, how did you get into this work?  
**[1:06:40-1:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:06:40):**  I didn't, I didn't come as a regenerative permaculture person.  
**[1:06:45-1:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:06:45):**  I came as an urban planner to work on post-war town planning in South Sudan in 2005, working  
**[1:06:53-1:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:06:53):**  with the government and working with the technical people from the ministries.  
**[1:07:00-1:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:07:00):**  There was no community at that time per se, like they were returning as refugees.  
**[1:07:05-1:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:07:05):**  But because in my context, I started to see needs that as I was learning about agroforestry,  
**[1:07:11-1:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:07:11):**  agroecology, passive water design, all these things, I was like, I think that this tool  
**[1:07:16-1:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:07:16):**  can be used to be applied to the challenges faced where I am.  
**[1:07:23-1:07:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:07:23):**  So I think permaculture needs to meet people where they are.  
**[1:07:28-1:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:07:28):**  I'm a permaculturalist.  
**[1:07:30-1:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:07:30):**  I'm not a farmer, right?  
**[1:07:32-1:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:07:32):**  In my apartment, I have giant bins of earthworms and I compost any organic material, carton  
**[1:07:40-1:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:07:40):**  boxes, food waste, bones, a whole rooster.  
**[1:07:46-1:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:07:46):**  And I go spirulina with my own urine.  
**[1:07:48-1:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:07:48):**  I have a garden growing all kinds of crazy things out there.  
**[1:07:51-1:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:07:51):**  So am I a farmer?  
**[1:07:52-1:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:07:52):**  No.  
**[1:07:53-1:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:07:53):**  But people are like, why don't you move into a house?  
**[1:07:55-1:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:07:55):**  And I'm like, well, there's excitement in demonstrating.  
**[1:07:59-1:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:07:59):**  If you're an urban apartment dweller, do what you can, use the space that you can.  
**[1:08:05-1:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:08:05):**  If I have IT professionals who reached out to me, they're like, I want to shift my career.  
**[1:08:10-1:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:08:10):**  I want to be part of the regenerative or permaculture movement.  
**[1:08:13-1:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:08:13):**  You don't have to quit your job and forfeit a salary and go buy land and start doing market  
**[1:08:20-1:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:08:20):**  gardening.  
**[1:08:21-1:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:08:21):**  Use your skills, let permaculture meet you where you are and make apps.  
**[1:08:27-1:08:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:08:27):**  Become support with some of the tech that's needed.  
**[1:08:29-1:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:08:29):**  I'm not a gimmick person, but there are some tech things that can be really helpful, right?  
**[1:08:36-1:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:08:36):**  Connecting people, especially around circular economy.  
**[1:08:38-1:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:08:38):**  I mean, that's a whole nother conversation, but as we dematerialize our economies and  
**[1:08:43-1:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:08:43):**  start to move more into utility economies and service-based economies, like for example,  
**[1:08:50-1:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:08:50):**  I presume you own a fridge or you have a critic or whatever.  
**[1:08:54-1:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:08:54):**  You need the function of that, but you don't want to deal with asset disposal and all this  
**[1:09:01-1:09:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:09:01):**  stuff.  
**[1:09:02-1:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:09:02):**  I mean, how can people with an IT department come with the apps required and innovation  
**[1:09:09-1:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:09:09):**  to link people within movements, within markets, within circular markets, within regenerative  
**[1:09:15-1:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:09:15):**  waste, resource recovery?  
**[1:09:17-1:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:09:17):**  You can still be a permaculturist and be in an office and make a major contribution.  
**[1:09:24-1:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:09:24):**  I would also say that wherever you are, some indigenous community was there.  
**[1:09:30-1:09:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:09:30):**  If you're in the US, there is a renaissance and emergence of indigenous justice, I think.  
**[1:09:42-1:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:09:42):**  With that, if you know Sean Sherman, the sous chef, and other actors from different tribes  
**[1:09:49-1:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:09:49):**  in different parts of the US, I would say, are there people within my community who are  
**[1:09:55-1:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:09:55):**  trying to do something to heal this landscape, to return to the indigenous foundation that  
**[1:10:00-1:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:10:00):**  worked here for so long before colonialism?  
**[1:10:04-1:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:10:04):**  Are there single mothers?  
**[1:10:06-1:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:10:06):**  Are there battered women?  
**[1:10:11-1:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:10:11):**  What in my town or in my community can I do, can I volunteer, can I do to try to build  
**[1:10:17-1:10:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:10:17):**  up our bioregions so it's competitive, it's resilient to Ukraine and Russia and divorcing  
**[1:10:24-1:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:10:24):**  ourselves from fossil fuels?  
**[1:10:27-1:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:10:27):**  Anyway, there's so many examples.  
**[1:10:31-1:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:10:31):**  But from where you're sitting, how do you bring the tools in to help problem solve the  
**[1:10:37-1:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:10:37):**  things that you're already working on, is what I would say.  
**[1:10:40-1:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:10:40):**  But if you are looking to break into the international development work, that's a hard question  
**[1:10:48-1:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:10:48):**  for me to answer because I came as an urban planner to come do urban planning, hired by  
**[1:10:52-1:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:10:52):**  a firm that had a project in urban planning.  
**[1:10:55-1:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:10:55):**  I think the more you increase your knowledge, the more you increase your skills, the more  
**[1:11:00-1:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:11:00):**  you have value to add.  
**[1:11:03-1:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:11:03):**  Use LinkedIn, use the professional networks, try to keep connecting with people who are  
**[1:11:09-1:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:11:09):**  doing something similar.  
**[1:11:11-1:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:11:11):**  And I think that we're going to see a swelling of opportunities all over the world for localized  
**[1:11:17-1:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:11:17):**  solutions.  
**[1:11:18-1:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:11:18):**  Very well said.  
**[1:11:19-1:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:11:19):**  And that's very much in line with what I've been trying to make this podcast focused on,  
**[1:11:24-1:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:11:24):**  is the message that all of your skill sets, all of your experiences can be contributed  
**[1:11:28-1:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:11:28):**  to this and that you can apply, whether it's permaculture design thinking or holistic management  
**[1:11:35-1:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:11:35):**  frameworks to whatever sector you're already in and whatever challenges that you're finding  
**[1:11:40-1:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:11:40):**  in your own community.  
**[1:11:41-1:11:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:11:41):**  Much like you said, you don't need to go to the other side of the world to be some sort  
**[1:11:45-1:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:11:45):**  of savior of the ecological elements.  
**[1:11:48-1:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:11:48):**  You can address the issues that your community are having, the projects that are already  
**[1:11:56-1:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:11:56):**  underway.  
**[1:11:57-1:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:11:57):**  Oftentimes being of help to someone's project that has been going on for a while and has  
**[1:12:02-1:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:12:02):**  been lacking in support can be much more effective because they've done a lot of the groundwork  
**[1:12:08-1:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:12:08):**  than everybody having to start their own project and start from scratch and be the person who  
**[1:12:13-1:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:12:13):**  started it.  
**[1:12:14-1:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:12:14):**  A lot of it is just the ego in that, whereas assisting and offering support in something  
**[1:12:20-1:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:12:20):**  that's been struggling to get going for a long time but has a lot more knowledge and  
**[1:12:25-1:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:12:25):**  a lot more establishment than your new cool effort is, it's not as glamorous, but it is  
**[1:12:31-1:12:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:12:31):**  just as necessary if not more.  
**[1:12:34-1:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:12:34):**  And you know, also, well, first of all, if you live on our planet, you are in an ecosystem,  
**[1:12:41-1:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:12:41):**  you're in a watershed, you're in a fiber shed.  
**[1:12:44-1:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:12:44):**  So connect with groups, and especially if you're trying to cut your teeth and learn  
**[1:12:48-1:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:12:48):**  how to do new things in ecological restoration, then definitely look at your own ecosystem.  
**[1:12:56-1:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:12:56):**  But if your ecosystem is New York City or a major urban space, there are a lot of ways  
**[1:13:01-1:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:13:01):**  that we don't talk enough about to be involved.  
**[1:13:04-1:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:13:04):**  So there may be city council committees where you are, like if you want to get involved  
**[1:13:11-1:13:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:13:11):**  locally in whatever the committees you are, city council, they can be on bike paths, they  
**[1:13:16-1:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:13:16):**  can be on affordable housing, they can be on public transit, they can be on pocket parks,  
**[1:13:21-1:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:13:21):**  they can be more on urban agroforestry.  
**[1:13:23-1:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:13:23):**  So you may have an office job, but you want to be involved, start with that.  
**[1:13:27-1:13:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:13:27):**  And especially in the US, there are so many opportunities to get involved in the local  
**[1:13:32-1:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:13:32):**  governance structures and have a voice.  
**[1:13:35-1:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:13:35):**  There's a lot more agency, well, in some ways, at the municipal level within the US, and  
**[1:13:42-1:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:13:42):**  even in Barcelona, by the way.  
**[1:13:44-1:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:13:44):**  There's a lot going on here.  
**[1:13:46-1:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:13:46):**  Yeah.  
**[1:13:47-1:13:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:13:47):**  So you don't have to be a farmer, you don't have to touch dirt if you don't want to touch  
**[1:13:52-1:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:13:52):**  dirt.  
**[1:13:53-1:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:13:53):**  But again, going back to dedicating your life's energy to life affirming endeavors, if you're  
**[1:13:58-1:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:13:58):**  going to be in an office and you want to be like, hey, I can support or I can fundraise  
**[1:14:02-1:14:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:14:02):**  or I can help do research or I can help come with a vision or use my IT skills or my finance  
**[1:14:08-1:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:14:08):**  skills or whatever.  
**[1:14:09-1:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:14:09):**  Yeah, so many opportunities.  
**[1:14:12-1:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:14:12):**  And Natalie, before we wrap up, can you tell our listeners how they can either get in touch  
**[1:14:16-1:14:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:14:16):**  with you or find more resources along these lines?  
**[1:14:19-1:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:14:19):**  Okay, well, one way that people can get a hold of me is through my LinkedIn account.  
**[1:14:25-1:14:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:14:25):**  So the name is Natalie Topa, not the French type, no H. Natalie Topa.  
**[1:14:31-1:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:14:31):**  And you can reach out to me there.  
**[1:14:34-1:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:14:34):**  And I also have just created a YouTube channel, which I haven't edited.  
**[1:14:39-1:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:14:39):**  They're not edited.  
**[1:14:40-1:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:14:40):**  It's just all like Natalie B roll.  
**[1:14:44-1:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:14:44):**  But sometimes when I'm in the field, I would make videos internally for our teams, just  
**[1:14:49-1:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:14:49):**  little clips here and there.  
**[1:14:50-1:14:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:14:50):**  So I thought maybe other people can find this useful.  
**[1:14:55-1:15:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:14:55):**  So the YouTube channel is called Natalie Topa.  
**[1:15:00-1:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:15:00):**  And I do also have Facebook groups.  
**[1:15:02-1:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:15:02):**  There's one called Natalie Topa, colon, permaculture and resilience design.  
**[1:15:06-1:15:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:15:06):**  Another one is naturally topa, colon, regenerative communities and circular bioeconomy.  
**[1:15:12-1:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:15:12):**  Another one is naturally topa, colon, fungi and mycology.  
**[1:15:16-1:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:15:16):**  And then naturally topa, colon, the permaculture kitchen and home.  
**[1:15:20-1:15:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:15:20):**  And then lastly, naturally topa, colon, seed saving and sovereignty.  
**[1:15:24-1:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:15:24):**  So I try to share out things that I'm doing, but also other resources as I'm doing my own  
**[1:15:29-1:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:15:29):**  research of money.  
**[1:15:30-1:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:15:30):**  Oh, that's fantastic.  
**[1:15:31-1:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:15:31):**  All right.  
**[1:15:32-1:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:15:32):**  I'll be sure to link to all of those in the show notes for this episode.  
**[1:15:36-1:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:15:36):**  And Natalie, it was such a pleasure to talk to you.  
**[1:15:38-1:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:15:38):**  Thank you so much for taking the time.

**[1:15:40-1:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:15:40):**  Sure.

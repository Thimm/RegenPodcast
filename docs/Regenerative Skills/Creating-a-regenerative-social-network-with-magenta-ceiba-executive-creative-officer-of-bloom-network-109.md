### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 26 Apr 2019 15:04:22)
**[0:00:00-0:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:00:13):**  Here we dive deep into the diverse worlds of regenerative living, permaculture, and  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:00:17):**  natural building as we aspire to help you reach your highest potential for yourself,  
**[0:00:22-0:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:00:22):**  for your community, and for this beautiful planet that we share.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:00:25):**  As always, I'm your host Oliver Gaucher, and I'm thrilled to guide you through this  
**[0:00:29-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:00:29):**  next episode, so let's jump right in!  
**[0:00:59-0:01:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:00:59):**  Join us this May 17th through the 25th in Plata√±o, Costa Rica for a comprehensive intro  
**[0:01:07-0:01:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:01:07):**  to bamboo building immersion.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:01:09):**  In this week-long course, we will cover bamboo design and model making, species and varieties,  
**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:01:14):**  harvesting, processing, treatment and curing methods, joining and lashing techniques, furniture  
**[0:01:19-0:01:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:01:19):**  making, tools, and so much more.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:01:21):**  All food served as 100% organic and farm fresh.

**[0:01:30-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:01:30):**  Today we're going to kick off a month-long exploration of various community models that  
**[0:01:35-0:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:01:35):**  are focused on regenerating environments, communication, and healthy cultures.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:01:39):**  Now in the next three weeks I'll be looking closely into regenerative social networks,  
**[0:01:44-0:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:01:44):**  ecovillages, and cohousing configurations.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:01:48):**  As the regenerative movement builds momentum around the world, people are rethinking the  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:01:52):**  communities and societies that either promote or disincentivize healthy development.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:01:57):**  And though I've never found a community structure that is perfect, the interviews this month  
**[0:02:01-0:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:02:01):**  aim to identify the innovative progress of the communal structures that I mentioned,  
**[0:02:06-0:02:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:02:06):**  and unpack the successes, challenges, and lessons in the process of creating truly regenerative  
**[0:02:11-0:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:02:11):**  community structures.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:02:14):**  My guest today, Magenta Seba, is the Executive Creative Officer of the Bloom Network.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:02:19):**  The Bloom Network is an in-person social network that uses online tools to collaboratively  
**[0:02:24-0:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:02:24):**  work on regenerating culture and life systems.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:02:27):**  Local Bloom chapters host skill shares, educational events, and hands-on actions in collaboration  
**[0:02:33-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:02:33):**  with different social movements in their cities.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:02:35):**  Their online collaboration platform uses augmented intelligence, a wiki, and video calls to help  
**[0:02:41-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:02:41):**  different social good movements share best practices and pool resources so they can be  
**[0:02:46-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:02:46):**  stronger together.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:02:47):**  They also produce a yearly conference to support regenerative innovation called Pollination.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:02:53):**  Now in this interview, we explore the three main focuses of Bloom, namely food security,  
**[0:02:58-0:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:02:58):**  alternative economic models, and conflict resolution.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:03:01):**  Magenta also explains how branches of this network are formed and supported in their  
**[0:03:05-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:03:05):**  initiatives, and we even go into more personal topics, such as how people of privileged backgrounds  
**[0:03:10-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:03:10):**  can help to promote the voices and perspectives of people who have been disenfranchised by  
**[0:03:16-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:03:16):**  society.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:03:17):**  This is a very nuanced look at the intricacies of community building and the aspects of regenerative  
**[0:03:21-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:03:21):**  culture.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:03:22):**  So you might want to grab a notebook as I turn things over now to Magenta.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:03:26):**  Hey Magenta, it's so good to be talking with you.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:03:28):**  How are you doing today?  
**[0:03:29-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:03:29):**  You too, Oliver.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:03:30):**  I'm doing really well.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:03:31):**  How are you?  
**[0:03:32-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:03:32):**  I'm doing super.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:03:33):**  I just took a boat to get over to my friend's house who has better internet connection than  
**[0:03:37-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:03:37):**  we do at the farm.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:03:38):**  So this should go really well now.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:03:40):**  That's wonderful.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:03:41):**  I am not on boats often enough.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:03:44):**  Well, hey, so look, I've got a ton of questions to ask you about the Bloom Network and your  
**[0:03:48-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:03:48):**  role in it.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:03:49):**  So what do you say we just get started?  
**[0:03:51-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:03:51):**  Great.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:03:52):**  All right, so we'll start by telling us a little bit about your background and how you  
**[0:03:56-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:03:56):**  came to be involved with the Bloom Network.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:03:59):**  Sure.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:04:00):**  Um, I used to be a professional piano player.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:04:04):**  And like a lot of classical musicians to play other kinds of music, I've had to set my primary  
**[0:04:09-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:04:09):**  instrument down for, it's been about 13 years.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:04:12):**  I think I'm done now, but average is 10.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:04:15):**  So in that time, you know, I've been doing administrative work.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:04:20):**  And when I moved to San Francisco, I'm originally from Montana, I got involved with a women's  
**[0:04:27-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:04:27):**  leadership training group called Radical Women.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:04:30):**  And I learned a lot about things like the axes of oppression, and why it's important  
**[0:04:37-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:04:37):**  to support queer women of color leadership, because they tend to have really clear sight  
**[0:04:44-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:04:44):**  on the ways to move through the kind of the stacks of oppression that bear down on people  
**[0:04:53-0:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:04:53):**  in the different ways.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:04:55):**  And through that work, I started to see the need for tools for healing from trauma, and  
**[0:05:04-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:05:04):**  also kind of found my own center in wanting to lead from a place of creating the world  
**[0:05:11-0:05:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:05:11):**  that and illustrating the world that I know is possible and like healthy futures.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:05:18):**  And I was teaching workshops in art through Radical Women, teaching art skills to activists  
**[0:05:25-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:05:25):**  and encouraging, yeah, encouraging artists to get involved in activist projects too.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:05:32):**  And during that time, I came across this organization called Evolver, which the local chapters of  
**[0:05:40-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:05:40):**  that are now the organization that I am the executive creative officer of called Bling  
**[0:05:46-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:05:46):**  Network.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:05:47):**  And because I had been working with psychedelic mushrooms a lot, like in this journey, I kind  
**[0:05:51-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:05:51):**  of stumbled into those.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:05:53):**  And they were so helpful for me for healing, I guess, depression and anxiety, and helping  
**[0:05:59-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:05:59):**  me just have really much clearer thought and enjoying my life and connecting with nature.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:06:06):**  And yeah, I found Evolver because I was like, you know, I should probably look into what  
**[0:06:11-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:06:11):**  people have been doing with these things for 1000s of years, I was just kind of tripping  
**[0:06:15-0:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:06:15):**  on my own.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:06:16):**  And that kind of led me to this global community of people who were basically doing kind of  
**[0:06:21-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:06:21):**  social integration work of their healing experiences, not just through psychedelics, but also through  
**[0:06:28-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:06:28):**  things like yoga and meditation, and other transcendental experiences, including just  
**[0:06:33-0:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:06:33):**  like the political and ecological situation today, where a lot of people are kind of looking  
**[0:06:39-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:06:39):**  outside of their social conditioning and directly reconnecting with nature and realizing, you  
**[0:06:44-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:06:44):**  know, we need to shift a lot of the systems and the ways they are.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:06:48):**  And this group of people was just like, so inspiring and talented and skilled.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:06:53):**  And so yeah, I got involved to kind of help on the business development front, essentially,  
**[0:06:59-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:06:59):**  because it was a lot of really visionary projects, and then kind of a gap in the business skill  
**[0:07:04-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:07:04):**  set, because it's, it was a lot of people who weren't necessarily going to go get their  
**[0:07:08-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:07:08):**  MBA.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:07:09):**  But it was also tangential enough to other networks that have this skill network, those  
**[0:07:14-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:07:14):**  those skill sets, that I kind of came to kind of bridge that gap.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:07:18):**  And ultimately, the leadership structure of what was in at the time, Evolver was pretty  
**[0:07:25-0:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:07:25):**  hierarchical, hierarchical and male led out of New York City.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:07:31):**  And, you know, it wasn't that their vision for, you know, a peer led network of local  
**[0:07:37-0:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:07:37):**  groups that are reskilling each other and sharing best practices and pooling resources  
**[0:07:43-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:07:43):**  and helping more people get involved in making their communities, you know, healthier, more  
**[0:07:48-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:07:48):**  equitable places to be, it really needed a peer to peer leadership structure.  
**[0:07:54-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:07:54):**  And so with my background, from radical women, and administrative work, I was able to kind  
**[0:08:00-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:08:00):**  of step in and sort of, um, kind of tease out what was out of alignment.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:08:06):**  And ultimately, you know, we had to separate from Evolver as a company to be able to host  
**[0:08:12-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:08:12):**  a peer led network.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:08:13):**  And so that's where we are today with Bloom.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:08:16):**  Wow, that's a really remarkable story.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:08:18):**  It's fascinating to hear how you went through all of those different steps and different  
**[0:08:23-0:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:08:23):**  pursuits, while finding your niche and your your place within this network.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:08:28):**  So along those lines, can you tell us what Bloom represents today and what it aims to  
**[0:08:33-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:08:33):**  achieve?  
**[0:08:34-0:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:08:34):**  Yeah, so Bloom network is what we are calling a regenerative social network.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:08:41):**  So we have local chapters all over the world that produce events and media and hands on  
**[0:08:48-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:08:48):**  actions.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:08:49):**  Often they're doing skill shares.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:08:51):**  Sometimes they're doing city wide festivals.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:08:54):**  And then we collaborate online to share best practices and inspire each other basically,  
**[0:08:59-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:08:59):**  because the only tools to do that exist today.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:09:03):**  And so, you know, instead of just chatting with each other about the way things are,  
**[0:09:09-0:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:09:09):**  it's more we've kind of been building a collaboration platform that kind of straddles digital and  
**[0:09:17-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:09:17):**  physical so that we can use the amazing online collaboration and networking tools to actively  
**[0:09:24-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:09:24):**  collaborate toward, you know, helping different social movements collaborate so that we can  
**[0:09:31-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:09:31):**  pull resources together and provide kind of a flip the power dynamic where we're moving  
**[0:09:37-0:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:09:37):**  from extractive ways of doing things to truly like led by community leaders on the ground  
**[0:09:45-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:09:45):**  who are really connected to place, you know, receptively listening to the leaders of multiple  
**[0:09:52-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:09:52):**  movements and utilizing collective wisdom tools so that we can transition the way we  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:10:00):**  are with our ecologies and with our economic structures.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:10:05):**  And for example, you know, the way we approach housing today, sharing tools for how to make  
**[0:10:11-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:10:11):**  sure that access to, you know, consistent housing is a thing that's possible and, you  
**[0:10:18-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:10:18):**  know, developing that deeply rooted relationship with place and ecology and spirit and all  
**[0:10:26-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:10:26):**  the wonderful things that come from that.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:10:28):**  So it's really kind of like a visionary futurist project of, you know, creating these, you  
**[0:10:35-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:10:35):**  might say permaculture utopias in a way, but it's kind of permaculture in a social and  
**[0:10:41-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:10:41):**  multi movement collaborative sense.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:10:45):**  And that's really what we're on about with Bloom Network.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:10:47):**  And I gotta say that's what originally drew me to investigate more about this is how you've  
**[0:10:53-0:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:10:53):**  been applying permaculture concepts to much more than just ecological care.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:10:58):**  Now I know that part of Bloom's mission is to accelerate the spread of regenerative culture.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:11:04):**  And I'm wondering, what does regenerative culture mean to you?  
**[0:11:08-0:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:11:08):**  And how have you seen it manifest in the projects that you facilitate?  
**[0:11:11-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:11:11):**  Sure, you know, it's been interesting since we kind of picked the phrase regenerative  
**[0:11:17-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:11:17):**  culture, it seems to be using be used online, largely from an ecology standpoint, and more  
**[0:11:28-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:11:28):**  white lead than we were kind of hoping the direction it would go, it seems like kind  
**[0:11:33-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:11:33):**  of an evolution of the sustainability movement.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:11:37):**  So I think what we're what we would like to do as an organization is help shape the definition  
**[0:11:44-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:11:44):**  of how that word is used to be kind of more interdisciplinary.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:11:52):**  So right now we're looking we have kind of seven topic areas that we bring together.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:11:58):**  We'll probably honestly vote on that every couple years and see if that the words we  
**[0:12:02-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:12:02):**  pick for these things like that frame makes sense.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:12:05):**  But it basically combines social justice, community health, sustainable or ethical technology.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:12:14):**  Creative arts, peer to peer autonomy, and what we call Earth stewardship.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:12:21):**  And so within the projects that you facilitate, how have you seen that start to be an emergent  
**[0:12:26-0:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:12:26):**  quality of the cooperation that you incentivize?  
**[0:12:29-0:12:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:12:29):**  Well, one of the things is when we're hosting local events, the space that we create is  
**[0:12:39-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:12:39):**  almost like a public common space, like the container is very open.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:12:46):**  So we're not necessarily pushing people into an agenda or strongly asserting one angle  
**[0:12:54-0:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:12:54):**  in particular on how, you know, activism or community wellness should be done.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:13:01):**  And that really open, inviting and community led place, because the people who come to  
**[0:13:07-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:13:07):**  the events really were really receptive to shaping what happens through the local chapter,  
**[0:13:14-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:13:14):**  what kind of activities people do, what kind of support structures are needed and come  
**[0:13:18-0:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:13:18):**  into place.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:13:19):**  And online, we're really responsive as we develop our platform, so to speak, to community  
**[0:13:28-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:13:28):**  leadership.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:13:29):**  And so that openness itself helps weave those connections between movements.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:13:40):**  And this is kind of, you know, a structural design nerd kind of perspective, which I'm  
**[0:13:44-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:13:44):**  trying to shift out of speaking that way.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:13:48):**  But no worries, I really am the same as well.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:13:51):**  So by all means, go deep into the vocabulary.  
**[0:13:55-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:13:55):**  Tell me about how you're thinking about these processes, because I do a lot of this.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:14:00):**  Sure.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:14:01):**  So we really, you know, we modeled the network on mycelium.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:14:06):**  When we were part of Evolver, we were called Evolver spores.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:14:10):**  And the whole thing was like a mushroom metaphor.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:14:14):**  And so we're really like a connective tissue between social movements and what people are  
**[0:14:20-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:14:20):**  already doing more so than, you know, asserting an organization or kind of umbrella or circumscribing  
**[0:14:28-0:14:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:14:28):**  thing on top of that.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:14:31):**  And so that itself just allows, like I said, self coordination, peer to peer learning,  
**[0:14:40-0:14:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:14:40):**  non hierarchical leadership.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:14:43):**  And I know some people have bad experiences with non hierarchical organizing, but we're  
**[0:14:50-0:14:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:14:50):**  also not anti hierarchy, like the principle we look at it is, you know, encouraging people  
**[0:14:55-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:14:55):**  to step forward with their leadership, and their experience and their eldership in the  
**[0:15:01-0:15:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:15:01):**  various ways that is and respecting each other in that.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:15:05):**  And from that kind of natural, natural leadership emerges in a really, really healthy way.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:15:13):**  I'm trying to think of some specific examples of projects where you can see the that cooperative  
**[0:15:18-0:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:15:18):**  nature emerge in Los Mochis, Mexico.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:15:22):**  There's a local bloom there, and they organize as Proyecto Fe.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:15:27):**  And it means project faith.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:15:30):**  And they host a, every year they host a festival, they call it a biocultural festival.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:15:37):**  And it's a collaboration between I think 17 different NGOs in the region.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:15:42):**  And so and it has a like multi disciplinary frame.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:15:48):**  So there's local food movement people there.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:15:51):**  There are people encouraging people to ride bikes.  
**[0:15:55-0:15:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:15:55):**  There's yoga and mindfulness kind of things.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:15:58):**  As well as, I think some kind of marketing support for local regenerative businesses,  
**[0:16:06-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:16:06):**  so that they kind of increase the the viability of doing that kind of like rooted, place based,  
**[0:16:17-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:16:17):**  healthy business making.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:16:20):**  And they're also working in relationship with, I think, a couple of nearby indigenous groups.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:16:27):**  So both in terms of having relationships with them, so they are responding to the eldership  
**[0:16:35-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:16:35):**  of those groups in the way that they organize.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:16:38):**  And then also doing service work with those groups kind of as requested and in dialogue.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:16:45):**  They also host a network of eco parks throughout the city that they're building.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:16:49):**  So there's a space for sports.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:16:50):**  And there's a space for teaching people community gardening, or, you know, urban gardening,  
**[0:16:56-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:16:56):**  so that the food sovereignty pieces, they're stronger.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:16:59):**  And then there's a kind of a workshop in art space as well for, you know, again, peer education.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:17:05):**  And so, you know, it's an emergent, vibrant, again, open containers for civic community  
**[0:17:12-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:17:12):**  to come together and create wellness where they are, you know, whatever that looks like  
**[0:17:18-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:17:18):**  to them and in a kind of mutually supportive, collaborative, community oriented way.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:17:24):**  And such a fantastic example of a community sort of taking back its sovereignty and implementing  
**[0:17:29-0:17:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:17:29):**  these projects and services and connectivity that really seem to exemplify what the Bloom  
**[0:17:36-0:17:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:17:36):**  Network promotes.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:17:37):**  Now, I know that the three main focuses of the network are identified as food security,  
**[0:17:44-0:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:17:44):**  alternative economic models and conflict resolution.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:17:47):**  So let's take those one at a time, starting with food security.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:17:51):**  Could you describe some of the ways that your network has come up with to address food sovereignty  
**[0:17:55-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:17:55):**  on their sites?  
**[0:17:57-0:17:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:17:57):**  Sure.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:17:58):**  Yeah, that's been maybe like the most common thing we do.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:18:04):**  The local chapter in Long Beach, which at the time when we were part of Evolver, they  
**[0:18:08-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:18:08):**  actually went with, they partnered with Shift.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:18:11):**  They were called Shift Long Beach, primarily just because of the fiscal relationship of  
**[0:18:15-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:18:15):**  that situation was easier for them.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:18:17):**  But anyway, what they were still kind of in contact with and collaborating with the network.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:18:22):**  And what they ended up focusing on was called Long Beach Fresh.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:18:27):**  And that's kind of a local food movement building organization that encourages local food producers  
**[0:18:35-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:18:35):**  and eaters, like restaurants and that kind of thing.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:18:38):**  And farmers markets to, you know, they're working on policy development so that their  
**[0:18:45-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:18:45):**  cities policies are most supportive to local food access.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:18:51):**  And they also, again, kind of work on that marketing piece so that people know that local  
**[0:18:55-0:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:18:55):**  food is a thing that they can do, anything that they can participate in, anything that  
**[0:18:59-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:18:59):**  is healthy for people and the surrounding ecology, and all the kinds of resilience that  
**[0:19:06-0:19:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:19:06):**  having strong local food sovereignty brings.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:19:11):**  In Baltimore, Maryland, the Bloom Fair is hosting a yearly festival called Mushroom  
**[0:19:19-0:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:19:19):**  City Art Festival.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:19:20):**  And it's all about mushrooms and they teach people foraging and cultivation, as well as  
**[0:19:26-0:19:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:19:26):**  some of the cultural and artistic things that come through the, you know, the wonderful  
**[0:19:31-0:19:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:19:31):**  varied world of mushrooms.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:19:33):**  So they have, you know, researchers from Johns Hopkins, they're talking about psilocybin research  
**[0:19:37-0:19:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:19:37):**  for anxiety and depression and, you know, all the new stuff that's coming from that,  
**[0:19:43-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:19:43):**  as well as, you know, working with, bringing in speakers who work on things like using  
**[0:19:50-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:19:50):**  mushrooms to clean up oil pollution, because there are some species of mushrooms that can  
**[0:19:54-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:19:54):**  convert the, I don't know the details of the science, it's like some kind of polycarbon  
**[0:19:59-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:19:59):**  that is involved with oil spills, it like converts that into a starch basically.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:20:04):**  So you can cultivate the mycelium to deal with that.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:20:09):**  So people are, you know, trying to reskill each other, that's a thing that they can do.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:20:14):**  Also learning about citizen science that you can do with mushrooms.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:20:17):**  But the other thing that they're working on there specific to food security is they're  
**[0:20:22-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:20:22):**  using mushrooms and other plants to, it's called, to remediate a lot in a neighborhood  
**[0:20:33-0:20:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:20:33):**  called Johnston Square in Baltimore.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:20:36):**  And the soil on the lot has a high concentration of lead, so you can't put food there.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:20:41):**  So they are using plants and mushrooms through micro remediation and bioremediation to, you  
**[0:20:48-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:20:48):**  know, remove the lead from the soil so that it can ultimately be, I think their goal is  
**[0:20:53-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:20:53):**  to convert it into a community garden.  
**[0:20:56-0:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:20:56):**  I need to double check on that.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:20:58):**  But that is kind of a local food and economic sovereignty thing.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:21:02):**  Johnston Square is primarily a Black community and the organizers of Mushroom City Arts,  
**[0:21:09-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:21:09):**  I think I'm mostly white at this point, but they are cultivating relationships kind of  
**[0:21:15-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:21:15):**  two way to do this collaboration in a good way.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:21:20):**  And so there's all kinds of kind of more things than food sovereignty that are coming through  
**[0:21:25-0:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:21:25):**  that related to decolonization or anti-colonialization.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:21:31):**  And from what I understand, the race dynamics in Baltimore are pretty tense.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:21:37):**  And so that kind of relationship building, I haven't talked to the organizers super explicitly  
**[0:21:43-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:21:43):**  about this, but I will do that in the future because I'm curious to see, you know, what  
**[0:21:51-0:21:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:21:51):**  lessons are coming out of that and what beauty is emerging through that kind of relationship  
**[0:21:56-0:21:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:21:56):**  building.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:21:57):**  The last thing I'll mention is I think local organizers in Sydney, Australia helped produce  
**[0:22:03-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:22:03):**  a local and regional food sovereignty conference with Indigenous folks and mainstream agricultural  
**[0:22:12-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:22:12):**  producers and policy makers and local urban gardening people.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:22:18):**  You know, I don't think I followed all the details of that, but the goal was to kind  
**[0:22:21-0:22:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:22:21):**  of have a multi-stakeholder convening of people who are approaching food sovereignty from  
**[0:22:25-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:22:25):**  different angles and might have differing opinions and this kind of thing to kind of  
**[0:22:29-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:22:29):**  inform each other about, you know, what the different people affected by how we produce  
**[0:22:33-0:22:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:22:33):**  food are, you know, what is best for them, what they're learning, requests or demands  
**[0:22:40-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:22:40):**  they may have of each other to transition, how they are practicing and this kind of thing.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:22:44):**  And so they brought in really skilled facilitators to support this dialogue and then support  
**[0:22:49-0:22:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:22:49):**  the ongoing action that came out of that convening.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:22:52):**  So those are a few examples.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:22:54):**  That's fantastic.  
**[0:22:55-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:22:55):**  So let's talk now about some of the alternative economic models that you've been promoting  
**[0:23:00-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:23:00):**  through the network.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:23:01):**  Sure.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:23:02):**  Yeah, this has been a big focus for a while, which has been interesting because having  
**[0:23:07-0:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:23:07):**  that be a big focus has attracted a lot of people who are in transition.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:23:14):**  So we're trying to find a good, a healthy balance with that now and move out of just  
**[0:23:19-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:23:19):**  kind of exploring the concepts of these into making functional applications.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:23:25):**  So things we've been exploring are gift economy, alternate currencies, local currencies.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:23:31):**  I think Baltimore, our Bloom Baltimore people helped create the B Note, which is a local  
**[0:23:35-0:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:23:35):**  currency in Baltimore.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:23:38):**  We're now kind of exploring cryptocurrencies more and blockchain things.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:23:44):**  There's a company called Aragon that is sponsoring the conference that we're producing in San  
**[0:23:48-0:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:23:48):**  Francisco this August.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:23:50):**  We're doing a governance hackathon there to kind of piece through both this economic piece,  
**[0:23:55-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:23:55):**  like how do we functionally work as an international cooperative that is led by and supportive  
**[0:24:00-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:24:00):**  to all the participants, like both individuals and businesses and organizations that want  
**[0:24:05-0:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:24:05):**  to mutually support each other through this network.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:24:10):**  How do we make that more and more viable and supportive and nurturing for everybody in  
**[0:24:14-0:24:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:24:14):**  a really holistic way and including a financial way because we're obviously facing economic  
**[0:24:20-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:24:20):**  collapses at an increasing frequency, there's an increasing gap between low-income and super  
**[0:24:27-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:24:27):**  high-income people.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:24:29):**  And the technology solutions that are coming through now, I think are really fascinating  
**[0:24:35-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:24:35):**  and produce some possibly rapid transition opportunities for people.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:24:41):**  So I think a while ago, we were trying to encourage people to do a crypto party to learn  
**[0:24:52-0:24:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:24:52):**  encrypted communications and financial transactions.  
**[0:24:55-0:25:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:24:55):**  I think we're going to be doing a webinar on this in July on how to use cryptocurrency  
**[0:25:02-0:25:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:25:02):**  for the first time to buy things just to help kind of demystify the learning curve.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:25:08):**  Yeah, just so people can get familiar with using that because it potentially provides  
**[0:25:12-0:25:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:25:12):**  an on-ramp to encrypted use of money, anonymous use of money in places like Venezuela, where  
**[0:25:20-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:25:20):**  you're having an extreme economic situation.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:25:24):**  Bitcoin is one way that people are able to have a little bit more stable currency.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:25:31):**  And yes, what else?  
**[0:25:34-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:25:34):**  I lived on gift economy for like four or five years in the process of just sorting out all  
**[0:25:39-0:25:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:25:39):**  the mess that Evolver was in.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:25:44):**  And because it was like really deep healing work that we needed to do as a community.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:25:49):**  There was issues with one of the founders was accused of rape from multiple women, pressuring  
**[0:25:55-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:25:55):**  people who did not, you know, nonconsensual slash quasi nonconsensual sex.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:26:01):**  And yeah, power dynamics and again, this financial piece, because there was no economic or power  
**[0:26:10-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:26:10):**  or kind of curation access that the local organizers had to influencing the shape of  
**[0:26:14-0:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:26:14):**  the brand.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:26:15):**  And so we had been kind of collecting emails and building this network and then it was  
**[0:26:21-0:26:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:26:21):**  being used by this kind of technically a for-profit company to ultimately they did the pivot shift  
**[0:26:26-0:26:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:26:26):**  and started selling projects, products through it that were like really out of alignment  
**[0:26:31-0:26:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:26:31):**  with their values.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:26:32):**  Like the whole thing was a mess and like really sorting through these kind of again, these  
**[0:26:35-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:26:35):**  stacks of oppression in leadership and access and consent.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:26:42):**  And so that it was just so complicated that the only way I could really tease through  
**[0:26:46-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:26:46):**  it all was to 100% dedicate my time to that and feel into like the literally feel into  
**[0:26:54-0:27:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:26:54):**  the planet directly or working a lot with ayahuasca and mushrooms and really just physically  
**[0:27:00-0:27:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:27:00):**  tuning in and feeling where the systems were out of balance, like in our organization,  
**[0:27:06-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:27:06):**  but also on the planet because we're, you know, we have local organizers located in  
**[0:27:10-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:27:10):**  multiple cities, like 11 different countries or something at the time.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:27:14):**  And we're all in really deep communication with each other, both on the internet, but  
**[0:27:18-0:27:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:27:18):**  also I think physically in kind of this very, I don't know, subtle connected physical sense.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:27:25):**  And that work, it was just, yeah, the only way I could do it was Gibbs economy.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:27:30):**  So friends offered me places to stay in their houses.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:27:33):**  You know, I kind of lived on, I think under 200 bucks a month doing like odd jobs on some  
**[0:27:37-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:27:37):**  while.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:27:38):**  Occasionally I'd run out of food and then have to go, I would volunteer on organic farms  
**[0:27:42-0:27:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:27:42):**  for some time and then get like a huge box of vegetables.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:27:45):**  It was like really amazing how it all worked and how people were like recognizing the nature  
**[0:27:51-0:27:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:27:51):**  of the work that I was doing.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:27:53):**  And they couldn't like directly do that themselves because they had kids or a job or career to  
**[0:27:58-0:28:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:27:58):**  cultivate but, you know, the, yeah, the community support was there for me to do that.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:28:05):**  And there are a lot of challenges involved.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:28:07):**  I actually want to make a video blog about my experiences of living on gift economy,  
**[0:28:13-0:28:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:28:13):**  but I did do it and it was really interesting and I learned a lot, including like, I don't  
**[0:28:18-0:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:28:18):**  know, stepping into the fear that people have with their survival being tied to money.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:28:26):**  And so that's like, that's a, like a personal example, but I think a lot of people in our  
**[0:28:30-0:28:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:28:30):**  network are community organizers and it's a really high percentage of women as well.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:28:37):**  And a lot of that work is currently, you know, unpaid labor and we're working on finding  
**[0:28:42-0:28:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:28:42):**  ways to support those people directly.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:28:46):**  And so that's like the ultimate goal of the network is to, you know, one of the ways we're  
**[0:28:51-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:28:51):**  looking at it is to, I'm actually designing this this summer with a group of people here  
**[0:28:56-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:28:56):**  in San Francisco.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:28:57):**  We're having kind of like a financial mechanisms mastermind group to look at using these different  
**[0:29:04-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:29:04):**  tools.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:29:05):**  There's a thing called swarm fund for aggregating investment.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:29:10):**  I think it can be used to aggregate investment across different sectors because they all  
**[0:29:15-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:29:15):**  kind of have their own ways of moving money.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:29:18):**  And so if we can kind of pool those different things and set up decision making structures  
**[0:29:26-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:29:26):**  so that, you know, a combination of the local stakeholders that may be involved, different  
**[0:29:33-0:29:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:29:33):**  industries that would need to shift and different leaders that we respect from different disciplines  
**[0:29:39-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:29:39):**  to come together and help make decisions about.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:29:43):**  So for example, if there's an investment pool around earth stewardship and maybe like landscape  
**[0:29:49-0:29:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:29:49):**  restoration, you know, all the way to the nitty gritty of individual permaculture farms,  
**[0:29:54-0:29:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:29:54):**  for example, having a way to have a pool of money and then a group of decision makers  
**[0:29:59-0:30:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:29:59):**  that are trusted and voted upon, which is a whole for me, like the economics and the  
**[0:30:05-0:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:30:05):**  governance technology tools are really interwoven in how these kinds of bridges to collective  
**[0:30:12-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:30:12):**  liberation are going to be possible really quickly.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:30:16):**  But anyway, using collective decision making and wise collective decision making processes  
**[0:30:22-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:30:22):**  are, yeah, a way to, I think, decide as communities where to allocate resources with a higher  
**[0:30:31-0:30:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:30:31):**  degree of fidelity and wisdom than most of our state systems.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:30:36):**  And many of the individual sector systems are able to wisely distribute money to make  
**[0:30:43-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:30:43):**  the kind of regenerative transitions that we need to make collectively as humanity.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:30:48):**  Well, those are some fascinating observations and a lot of what you talked about, especially  
**[0:30:53-0:30:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:30:53):**  with your transition away from the previous network, make me think about, especially that  
**[0:30:59-0:31:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:30:59):**  last part that we were going to cover of conflict resolution.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:31:02):**  And I'm wondering in those experiences that you've had and with all of these different  
**[0:31:07-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:31:07):**  communities that you've interacted with and helped to foster, what are some of the main  
**[0:31:12-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:31:12):**  takeaways that you've learned in that process of conflict resolution?  
**[0:31:17-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:31:17):**  Oh man, so many.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:31:20):**  I'll just let that giggle speak for itself a little bit.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:31:28):**  Let's see, there's a couple of highlights.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:31:31):**  One of the most awesome things that we learned about is this thing called dynamic facilitation.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:31:39):**  One of our advisors, whose name is Tom Attlee, wrote a book called Empowering Public Wisdom,  
**[0:31:45-0:31:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:31:45):**  where he talks about this.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:31:47):**  It's almost like a combination of kind of deliberative decision-making across groups  
**[0:31:55-0:32:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:31:55):**  that have widely differing kind of values and needs in a situation and kind of long  
**[0:32:01-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:32:01):**  running conflicts and mediation.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:32:05):**  So the facilitator is trained to have each person really deeply listen to each other  
**[0:32:14-0:32:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:32:14):**  and understand fully where they're coming from and why they believe that things are  
**[0:32:19-0:32:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:32:19):**  that they think are the best thing to happen are that.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:32:23):**  And then from there, they start the dialogue about, okay, given that, what's the best thing  
**[0:32:31-0:32:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:32:31):**  that we can do?  
**[0:32:34-0:32:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:32:34):**  And it's community oriented, it has like really deep analytic tools that they bring to the  
**[0:32:41-0:32:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:32:41):**  table in terms of understanding the full spectrum of the historical things and individual emotional  
**[0:32:47-0:32:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:32:47):**  things.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:32:48):**  And it's just really fantastic.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:32:50):**  Any dynamic facilitator I've ever met is just amazing.  
**[0:32:54-0:32:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:32:54):**  So that's a practice that I think is really helpful for community conflict.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:32:59):**  And I would love to see that more widely adopted and known about.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:33:04):**  I mean, there's so many things.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:33:06):**  We started making a code of conduct for Bloom Network called the Vibrant Heart of Bloom.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:33:12):**  We're kind of in a skeleton of it, but we're really hoping that the community helps flesh  
**[0:33:17-0:33:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:33:17):**  it out and share practices that they have found helpful.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:33:23):**  So again, like creating it in a collaborative way rather than a few people making decisions.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:33:29):**  But creating an atmosphere where a spirit of collaboration is strong and a commitment  
**[0:33:41-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:33:41):**  to constructive action focused work, that eliminates some conflict.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:33:48):**  So for example, our development of how we're running Bloom Network has partly stemmed from  
**[0:33:54-0:33:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:33:54):**  looking at how dialogue happens on places like Facebook and Twitter.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:33:58):**  We have really shallow combative dialogues happening and not a lot of room for depth  
**[0:34:07-0:34:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:34:07):**  and space and teasing things out.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:34:08):**  And all my communication is tricky.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:34:11):**  So really looking at how do we cultivate the spaces for the depth and mutual listening  
**[0:34:20-0:34:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:34:20):**  that needs to happen.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:34:21):**  So for example, we've chosen to, we have a monthly community call on online that people  
**[0:34:28-0:34:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:34:28):**  can join to peer, learn, and share resources.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:34:34):**  And we kind of at the moment are keeping our collaboration to that live video space rather  
**[0:34:40-0:34:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:34:40):**  than doing a forum or kind of social posting sorts of things so that we have that space  
**[0:34:45-0:34:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:34:45):**  to have the depth and kind of a circle that has a space for a moderator and facilitator  
**[0:34:53-0:34:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:34:53):**  who can help move through conflicts and address them head on as they arise.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:34:59):**  So that's in a held space and it's at a frequency that we're able to do as we bootstrap the  
**[0:35:04-0:35:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:35:04):**  finances rather than I think having moderators and facilitators in a forum, which was initially  
**[0:35:11-0:35:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:35:11):**  how Evolver used to be a social network.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:35:14):**  And it just, it took a lot of work and it's a lot of time and a lot of work and we don't  
**[0:35:17-0:35:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:35:17):**  have that capacity yet.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:35:18):**  So doing it in live video, I think helps it be a little bit more receptive and everyone  
**[0:35:25-0:35:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:35:25):**  be sensitive to each other's needs.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:35:27):**  And then we have a lot of, as we discover, you know, tools and resources and educational  
**[0:35:32-0:35:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:35:32):**  things as we go along, we put those up on our Wiki on the internet, which any Glu members  
**[0:35:36-0:35:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:35:36):**  can contribute to.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:35:38):**  So for example, there's a resource on decolonization and anti-colonial solidarity there that has  
**[0:35:44-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:35:44):**  educational resources.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:35:45):**  So for example, when a white person comes into an organizing group that has a lot of  
**[0:35:51-0:35:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:35:51):**  different kinds of diversity in it and they're really early or don't even, haven't even started  
**[0:35:58-0:36:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:35:58):**  the learning curve of unpacking privilege and white fragility and these kinds of things.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:36:03):**  It's a resource we can direct people to go, you know, hey, we, you know, please digest  
**[0:36:09-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:36:09):**  some of this material and then come back once you're a little bit more informed of context  
**[0:36:15-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:36:15):**  here.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:36:16):**  And that kind of like strong boundary setting, encouraging each other to learn and also to  
**[0:36:23-0:36:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:36:23):**  keep a clean space rather than letting things fester are some things that we found helpful  
**[0:36:29-0:36:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:36:29):**  toward mitigating conflicts and you know, creating a space where deep relationships  
**[0:36:37-0:36:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:36:37):**  that are healthy can form.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:36:38):**  So I think that's fascinating.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:36:40):**  And I really love what you were talking about earlier in this interview about how you've  
**[0:36:45-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:36:45):**  worked with previously disenfranchised communities.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:36:49):**  Those that don't represent sort of the demographics in this country that have been primarily in  
**[0:36:55-0:36:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:36:55):**  power since the colonization of these lands.  
**[0:36:58-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:36:58):**  And as myself basically representing every single aspect of the imbalance of power dynamics  
**[0:37:07-0:37:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:37:07):**  in this country's history.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:37:08):**  I mean, I'm a Caucasian male heterosexual who grew up white privileged and I'm, I'm  
**[0:37:15-0:37:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:37:15):**  struggling to find out where our voices can be heard in this without of course silencing  
**[0:37:22-0:37:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:37:22):**  or ignoring the voices of other people who have so much to contribute and have previously  
**[0:37:28-0:37:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:37:28):**  been disenfranchised from these conversations.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:37:32):**  And you mentioned how we can do better by educating ourselves on the history of these  
**[0:37:38-0:37:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:37:38):**  power dynamics, how other types of demographics and identities have been silenced in the past.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:37:46):**  What else do you recommend in this path on promoting a more diverse perspective on community  
**[0:37:53-0:37:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:37:53):**  building and regenerative development?  
**[0:37:56-0:37:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:37:56):**  Yeah, I really feel you on that.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:37:59):**  Thanks for asking for more about that.  
**[0:38:02-0:38:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:38:02):**  You know, one of the ways is to support and put people of color and other disenfranchised  
**[0:38:12-0:38:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:38:12):**  communities in positions of leadership as we convene as a permaculture and regenerative  
**[0:38:21-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:38:21):**  community.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:38:23):**  Similar to how there's a lot of activism being done right now with representation in tech.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:38:28):**  And for example, there's a, I keep seeing a bunch from this thing called Lambda School,  
**[0:38:33-0:38:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:38:33):**  which has a financial model that allows women and people of color to learn how to code.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:38:40):**  And some of the systemic barriers are kind of put to the side so that they can gather  
**[0:38:46-0:38:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:38:46):**  the experience and education that they need to do that path.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:38:51):**  And then, you know, that is going to change how the platforms and technologies and the  
**[0:38:57-0:39:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:38:57):**  company cultures are built.  
**[0:39:00-0:39:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:39:00):**  So that's one piece.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:39:02):**  And having disenfranchised people in a position of leadership in a group, one helps make other  
**[0:39:10-0:39:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:39:10):**  people who are disenfranchised feel more comfortable because the power dynamic is just more receptive  
**[0:39:18-0:39:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:39:18):**  and the person kind of holding the space is aware of the dynamics.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:39:22):**  You know, I'm saying this as a white person, but from what I understand.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:39:26):**  And then the other piece is, I think, you know, it's something we have to, we're all  
**[0:39:33-0:39:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:39:33):**  figuring out as we go.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:39:35):**  It's a lot to unpack.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:39:37):**  And the more we can create spaces where we can do healthy collaboration and create healthy  
**[0:39:47-0:39:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:39:47):**  decolonized spaces, you know, which ultimately means giving leadership of land back to indigenous  
**[0:39:54-0:40:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:39:54):**  peoples, but the more we can, I mean, I think a good example is how you're describing the,  
**[0:40:03-0:40:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:40:03):**  you know, listen to a recent podcast of yours where you all were talking about working with  
**[0:40:09-0:40:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:40:09):**  coffee farmers and bringing your goats around.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:40:13):**  And so that's a really beautiful example of sharing wisdom that you have and something  
**[0:40:19-0:40:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:40:19):**  new that you figured out as a new person with, I don't know where goats are from, original  
**[0:40:24-0:40:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:40:24):**  me, but the fact that they help make the coffee farms more productive and is, you know, contributes  
**[0:40:32-0:40:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:40:32):**  to the regenerative wellness of a region.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:40:34):**  You know, that's a kind of like really practical, probably low drama way to build relationships  
**[0:40:42-0:40:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:40:42):**  and share healthy co-leadership and just stuff like that.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:40:48):**  There's a couple couple ideas.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:40:50):**  Yeah, and I've always found it more effective to lead by example rather than trying to persuade  
**[0:40:56-0:41:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:40:56):**  or incentivize other people to do whatever it is you might be pioneering or finding success  
**[0:41:02-0:41:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:41:02):**  in and rather just demonstrate the way that new ideas or even old ideas have created some  
**[0:41:10-0:41:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:41:10):**  sort of benefit or, you know, desired outcome through their implementation and wait to see  
**[0:41:16-0:41:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:41:16):**  who shows interest rather than going around and telling people that this is something  
**[0:41:20-0:41:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:41:20):**  that they should adopt or should consider, but rather make it something that is as attractive  
**[0:41:26-0:41:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:41:26):**  as possible through demonstration without as much, yeah, without being so loud about  
**[0:41:33-0:41:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:41:33):**  it in however many forms that may come.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:41:36):**  And what I'm interested in hearing from you is how have the branches of your the Bloom  
**[0:41:45-0:41:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:41:45):**  Network formed and what kind of support do these fledgling communities receive from the  
**[0:41:50-0:41:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:41:50):**  network?  
**[0:41:51-0:41:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:41:51):**  Because I know that there are different ways of incentivizing participation.  
**[0:41:55-0:42:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:41:55):**  How have you and the organization helped to sort of demonstrate a model that is worth  
**[0:42:01-0:42:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:42:01):**  collaborating with?  
**[0:42:03-0:42:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:42:03):**  A few a few ways.  
**[0:42:05-0:42:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:42:05):**  Let's see.  
**[0:42:08-0:42:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:42:08):**  And I think we've spent the last at least five years kind of designing the ways to do  
**[0:42:16-0:42:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:42:16):**  that in the future, and we're just now putting some of those in place.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:42:20):**  Some of the incentivization that is there is the peer support among fellow community  
**[0:42:27-0:42:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:42:27):**  organizers.  
**[0:42:28-0:42:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:42:28):**  So knowing that you have a regular place once a month to check in with other people who  
**[0:42:34-0:42:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:42:34):**  are in these kind of holistic leadership roles.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:42:39):**  So you can say, OK, I'm having this problem in my community.  
**[0:42:44-0:42:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:42:44):**  Have any of you faced that before or known another community that's gone through this?  
**[0:42:48-0:42:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:42:48):**  Can you connect me to some resources or wisdom for how to move through?  
**[0:42:53-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:42:53):**  Or even just being able to talk about these things because sometimes it's really heavy.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:43:01):**  Like the leadership roles we're in and being in a relationship with multiple different  
**[0:43:07-0:43:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:43:07):**  communities brings an interesting array of challenges and confrontation.  
**[0:43:17-0:43:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:43:17):**  But also like this almost like unbounded creative potential and capacity and expression.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:43:25):**  And the combination of those things is just so strong and beautiful and encouraging.  
**[0:43:32-0:43:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:43:32):**  And the more that now we're actually designing the financial and governance structures so  
**[0:43:38-0:43:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:43:38):**  that we can help people sustain those roles better.  
**[0:43:43-0:43:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:43:43):**  That was the kind of missing piece of, I would say, like the first 10 years of our development.  
**[0:43:47-0:43:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:43:47):**  And so, you know, I guess the last five of that, we've been looking at how to bridge  
**[0:43:52-0:43:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:43:52):**  that last gap because we think we can.  
**[0:43:55-0:44:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:43:55):**  We needed that kind of the ownership of our platform and brand, so to speak, to be able  
**[0:44:00-0:44:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:44:00):**  to do that.  
**[0:44:01-0:44:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:44:01):**  But like I said this summer, we're convening a governance hackathon at Pollination.  
**[0:44:05-0:44:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:44:05):**  That's a conference in San Francisco.  
**[0:44:08-0:44:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:44:08):**  And we'll be looking at exactly, for example, as people become members of International  
**[0:44:16-0:44:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:44:16):**  Globe Network, a percentage of their membership will go directly to the local chapter so that  
**[0:44:21-0:44:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:44:21):**  the local chapter, whatever leadership they decide is appropriate for their crew, can  
**[0:44:29-0:44:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:44:29):**  then decide themselves what to do with distributing that money.  
**[0:44:33-0:44:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:44:33):**  So rather than like a kind of a granting organization or something, it's up to the local chapters.  
**[0:44:39-0:44:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:44:39):**  And that helps build the leadership capacity and autonomy of local groups.  
**[0:44:44-0:44:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:44:44):**  And they may be somewhat centralized with a boom crew that's making skill shares, or  
**[0:44:50-0:44:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:44:50):**  they may be quite decentralized with just like a monthly meeting place.  
**[0:44:54-0:45:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:44:54):**  But they are self-organizing, topic specific or movement specific support crews or infrastructures.  
**[0:45:02-0:45:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:45:02):**  And so that's another way that we kind of innovate and learn from each other as an international  
**[0:45:06-0:45:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:45:06):**  community because that flexibility is so open.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:45:11):**  I think we're about to, I just finally started a local chapter here in Nevada City, California.  
**[0:45:16-0:45:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:45:16):**  We call it Bloom-Yuba Watershed because we're trying to encourage people to identify with  
**[0:45:20-0:45:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:45:20):**  their local bioregions.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:45:23):**  And even on the first meeting, it's like the second one, we have to jump into planning  
**[0:45:28-0:45:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:45:28):**  because everyone was like, yes, let's go, let's do this.  
**[0:45:32-0:45:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:45:32):**  Let's not just like teach each other things, but let's actually form like a healthy economic  
**[0:45:37-0:45:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:45:37):**  and other kinds of supportive infrastructure for us to transition.  
**[0:45:43-0:45:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:45:43):**  There's a lot of cannabis cultivation that has happened here in the last decades.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:45:46):**  And as more legalization happens, people are, you know, the economic viability of farming  
**[0:45:55-0:46:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:45:55):**  that medicine is shifting and a lot of people are having to transition.  
**[0:46:00-0:46:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:46:00):**  And so we're looking at the, you know, the healing wisdom that has come through that  
**[0:46:05-0:46:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:46:05):**  plant and the freedom that it has cultivated to learn other kinds of healing practices  
**[0:46:11-0:46:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:46:11):**  or explore creative arts and, you know, natural dying and weaving and this kind of thing,  
**[0:46:16-0:46:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:46:16):**  kind of blossoming the fruits that have come from that level of exploration.  
**[0:46:25-0:46:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:46:25):**  And so looking at how to share that with the world and also support each other in offering  
**[0:46:33-0:46:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:46:33):**  those gifts farther because we've been developing those a lot in, I think, almost a gift economy  
**[0:46:37-0:46:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:46:37):**  context because the cannabis culture here has supported a lot of, you know, open circulation  
**[0:46:45-0:46:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:46:45):**  of resources.  
**[0:46:46-0:46:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:46:46):**  And so it's possible that the local chapter here, for example, might end up collecting  
**[0:46:51-0:46:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:46:51):**  a local membership fee that allows people to have a listing and a directory.  
**[0:46:57-0:47:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:46:57):**  And then maybe 80% of that chapter fee goes to the local chapter and 20% international.  
**[0:47:05-0:47:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:47:05):**  Sometimes we might flip that ratio, but we really, I think that's how the membership  
**[0:47:10-0:47:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:47:10):**  is going to function.  
**[0:47:11-0:47:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:47:11):**  We're also looking at how that can work with organizations as well.  
**[0:47:16-0:47:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:47:16):**  So that Bloom Network is helping support media and outreach and marketing for all these incredible  
**[0:47:23-0:47:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:47:23):**  regenerative businesses from multiple different viewpoints of that and also community structures  
**[0:47:30-0:47:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:47:30):**  that may not be businesses, but would be supported by a more robust fabric of support and not  
**[0:47:36-0:47:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:47:36):**  depending on grant funding or, you know, completely grassroots organizing.  
**[0:47:41-0:47:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:47:41):**  But we have, it's a little bit abstract the way I'm talking because we haven't fleshed  
**[0:47:46-0:47:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:47:46):**  out exactly how it's designed, but by using a tool like Aragon where you can create like  
**[0:47:53-0:47:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:47:53):**  infinitely customized organization like decision making and financial relationships using smart  
**[0:47:59-0:48:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:47:59):**  contracts and then using cryptocurrency where international exchange of resources is very  
**[0:48:06-0:48:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:48:06):**  fast and efficient, really enables this kind of international decentralized financial and  
**[0:48:14-0:48:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:48:14):**  governance set up to emerge.  
**[0:48:15-0:48:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:48:15):**  And we really look at Bloom Network as not like a circumscribed like organization, but  
**[0:48:22-0:48:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:48:22):**  it is one of like a decentralized fabric of these kinds of communities and networks that  
**[0:48:27-0:48:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:48:27):**  are emerging and we're just sort of like one node or portal into that.  
**[0:48:33-0:48:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:48:33):**  And so a lot of what I've been looking at is how to, I guess in terms of like regenerative  
**[0:48:38-0:48:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:48:38):**  business design, I think the way that we start to almost like weave our business models together  
**[0:48:45-0:48:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:48:45):**  as an international regenerative community and or, you know, social permaculture, whatever  
**[0:48:50-0:48:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:48:50):**  the phrases are that people think about these sort of things, but more creating that instead  
**[0:48:57-0:49:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:48:57):**  of having to rely on the extractive layers or, you know, even like Google or Facebook  
**[0:49:02-0:49:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:49:02):**  to do marketing, it's like we can really directly do this with each other and not lose value  
**[0:49:08-0:49:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:49:08):**  to the extractive systems, but keep it in the network of people that are, you know,  
**[0:49:14-0:49:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:49:14):**  building and nourishing and regenerating our ecological and, you know, person to person  
**[0:49:21-0:49:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:49:21):**  relationships with each other.  
**[0:49:23-0:49:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:49:23):**  Let's switch gears here for just a second.  
**[0:49:25-0:49:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:49:25):**  I know that each new quarter the network promotes a new theme to inspire action and mobilization.  
**[0:49:31-0:49:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:49:31):**  But tell me what is the theme of this quarter and how has it been promoted for further action?  
**[0:49:36-0:49:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:49:36):**  The theme of this quarter, I think is collective wisdom.  
**[0:49:40-0:49:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:49:40):**  We're kind of just getting started with the themes again.  
**[0:49:43-0:49:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:49:43):**  I'm actually going to look on our website to double check because we've just been building  
**[0:49:48-0:49:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:49:48):**  momentum.  
**[0:49:50-0:49:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:49:50):**  The community calls have been just really open.  
**[0:49:53-0:49:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:49:53):**  So people showing up, people have a lot of questions about what Bloom Network is and  
**[0:49:58-0:50:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:49:58):**  how we're structured and how they can participate.  
**[0:50:00-0:50:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:50:00):**  So we're finding that so far, mostly this year, is we're having to be like much more  
**[0:50:05-0:50:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:50:05):**  open rather than so much being able to stick to the themes.  
**[0:50:08-0:50:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:50:08):**  But the yeah, the theme this quarter is collective wisdom.  
**[0:50:13-0:50:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:50:13):**  If you want to read about that, we have some interesting write ups on our website at bloomnetwork.org.  
**[0:50:20-0:50:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:50:20):**  And then if you go to the participate tab, there's a thing that says 2019 community calls.  
**[0:50:26-0:50:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:50:26):**  And you'll find the descriptions of the current themes.  
**[0:50:28-0:50:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:50:28):**  And I think it's interesting food for thought and kind of the frames that we've chosen for  
**[0:50:34-0:50:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:50:34):**  this year to help people start to connect with each other.  
**[0:50:39-0:50:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:50:39):**  The way it used to work with Evolvers, we had a monthly theme and every month all the  
**[0:50:44-0:50:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:50:44):**  local chapters would host an event about that.  
**[0:50:47-0:50:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:50:47):**  And that really helped us share resources as a community in a focused way and aggregate  
**[0:50:53-0:50:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:50:53):**  best practices and this kind of thing.  
**[0:50:55-0:50:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:50:55):**  So we're trying to move our way back toward that.  
**[0:50:57-0:51:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:50:57):**  I think with the brand transition, it was just so not supportive for people to participate.  
**[0:51:03-0:51:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:51:03):**  It was like an uphill battle that the local chapters started kind of just doing their  
**[0:51:08-0:51:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:51:08):**  own things and rhythms.  
**[0:51:10-0:51:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:51:10):**  And so we're kind of trying to bring the band back together slowly.  
**[0:51:15-0:51:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:51:15):**  So we'll see how this works with the quarterly themes.  
**[0:51:20-0:51:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:51:20):**  Quarterly seems a little bit more sustainable than monthly because producing a monthly event  
**[0:51:23-0:51:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:51:23):**  is just a lot of work.  
**[0:51:25-0:51:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:51:25):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:51:26-0:51:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:51:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:51:27-0:51:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:51:27):**  But one thing I'd like to see us do eventually is kind of almost publish like a digital magazine  
**[0:51:33-0:51:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:51:33):**  about each theme.  
**[0:51:34-0:51:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:51:34):**  So we're collecting the best practices from, again, that kind of holistic framework of  
**[0:51:40-0:51:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:51:40):**  different social movements that are related to the theme so that people can make those  
**[0:51:45-0:51:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:51:45):**  connections and start to reweave that collaborative fabric of what healthy society is, but collect  
**[0:51:53-0:52:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:51:53):**  the most awesome videos and art and organizations and things you can do in your backyard, kind  
**[0:52:00-0:52:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:52:00):**  of industry transformation things that are going on.  
**[0:52:03-0:52:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:52:03):**  I think that kind of like packaging of information might help to infuse the ecosystem of actors  
**[0:52:11-0:52:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:52:11):**  are known, so to speak, that we're connecting through this network, help them gain more  
**[0:52:18-0:52:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:52:18):**  exposure because a lot of these initiatives are really fledgling or marginalized.  
**[0:52:22-0:52:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:52:22):**  They kind of like have these little micro niches of people that they're talking to as  
**[0:52:26-0:52:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:52:26):**  they've been developing the sorts of healing things that can help humanity move through  
**[0:52:32-0:52:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:52:32):**  this time.  
**[0:52:33-0:52:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:52:33):**  And so we're out there, again, because of kind of the weird extractive system and the  
**[0:52:41-0:52:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:52:41):**  way that posting to Facebook, for example, incentivizes people that are going to make  
**[0:52:44-0:52:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:52:44):**  them a lot of money.  
**[0:52:46-0:52:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:52:46):**  And we kind of have to kind of short circuit that system and use it as well to make things  
**[0:52:52-0:52:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:52:52):**  more viable.  
**[0:52:53-0:52:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:52:53):**  So I think that can be an interesting, almost like media permaculture thing.  
**[0:52:58-0:53:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:52:58):**  That's kind of the point of themes, if we can get them going again.  
**[0:53:01-0:53:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:53:01):**  We'll see.  
**[0:53:02-0:53:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:53:02):**  Yeah, I love that perspective.  
**[0:53:04-0:53:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:53:04):**  Now, before we wrap up today, I would love to hear your personal opinion on what the  
**[0:53:09-0:53:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:53:09):**  highest potential for the Bloom Network is and what you're working actively towards realizing.  
**[0:53:15-0:53:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:53:15):**  I feel like the highest potential of Bloom Network is to make a thriving and resilient,  
**[0:53:27-0:53:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:53:27):**  decentralized reality of power dynamics and relationships with nature and ourselves that  
**[0:53:38-0:53:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:53:38):**  are healthy and equitable and really culturally just vibrant and flourishing.  
**[0:53:49-0:53:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:53:49):**  And I really think that's possible.  
**[0:53:53-0:54:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:53:53):**  I think it's possible to do quickly within 20 to 50 years, even though the climate change  
**[0:54:01-0:54:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:54:01):**  is bearing down pretty hard.  
**[0:54:04-0:54:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:54:04):**  I really believe in humanity's capacity and in Bloom Network's highest capacity to support  
**[0:54:11-0:54:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:54:11):**  the wisdom sharing and collaboration that will allow us to rapidly transition the way  
**[0:54:21-0:54:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:54:21):**  that we are in small communities and with the places that we are, really transform that  
**[0:54:29-0:54:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:54:29):**  into healthy, rejuvenating, vibrant, lovely, balanced places to be.  
**[0:54:38-0:54:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:54:38):**  It's kind of simple, as I said.  
**[0:54:41-0:54:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:54:41):**  It is, but there's so many complexities within the actualization of that.  
**[0:54:46-0:54:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:54:46):**  I definitely respect the amount of thought and the amount of preparation and organization  
**[0:54:52-0:54:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:54:52):**  that goes into actualizing what seems like such a simple and obvious potential.  
**[0:54:58-0:54:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:54:58):**  Yeah.  
**[0:54:59-0:55:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:54:59):**  And I think we have the clarity and will and heart connectedness and support of nature,  
**[0:55:11-0:55:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:55:11):**  even if it's a harsh support right now to make that transition.  
**[0:55:14-0:55:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:55:14):**  We have one of the weird byproducts of colonization and industrialization is the way that we have  
**[0:55:22-0:55:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:55:22):**  communication technologies right now.  
**[0:55:25-0:55:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:55:25):**  And we can and should absolutely use them to transition as quickly as possible.  
**[0:55:30-0:55:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:55:30):**  And this can, you know, the highest capacity of Bloom Network is for an internationally  
**[0:55:35-0:55:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:55:35):**  connected community of local, kind of local, almost called my healer leaders to bring through,  
**[0:55:48-0:55:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:55:48):**  utilize visionary creativity and inviting community into an open expression of that  
**[0:55:54-0:56:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:55:54):**  to kind of lift the lid off what we're capable and see what emerges in a way that is connected  
**[0:56:01-0:56:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:56:01):**  to nature and ethical values and these kind of things.  
**[0:56:05-0:56:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:56:05):**  I'm just really, really excited to see what happens as the fabric of that find itself  
**[0:56:12-0:56:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:56:12):**  and connects more.  
**[0:56:13-0:56:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:56:13):**  Because again, it's like not just Bloom Network, it's tons of other networks that are feeling  
**[0:56:17-0:56:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:56:17):**  this and creating this in their own unique ways.  
**[0:56:21-0:56:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:56:21):**  And it's a really strong thing that's coming through.  
**[0:56:23-0:56:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:56:23):**  And the more that people are aware of it and the more it's visible and findable, the faster  
**[0:56:28-0:56:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:56:28):**  it's going to gain traction because it's here, the global solidarity for this stuff is just  
**[0:56:34-0:56:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:56:34):**  so profound and so massive.  
**[0:56:37-0:56:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:56:37):**  And the mainstream media and governance might not be showing that very well, but it's so  
**[0:56:43-0:56:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:56:43):**  here and we're all holding each other's hands.  
**[0:56:46-0:56:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:56:46):**  And even just the example of your podcast, I'm listening to it and learning so much.  
**[0:56:50-0:56:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:56:50):**  And that's a whole huge community that you're in connection with.  
**[0:56:54-0:56:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:56:54):**  And there are so many of those.  
**[0:56:56-0:57:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:56:56):**  And I think the spirit of, like you described, that healthy demonstration of ways forward  
**[0:57:03-0:57:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:57:03):**  to this nowness of healthy connectivity with the planet and with spirit and with everything,  
**[0:57:13-0:57:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:57:13):**  it's here right now.  
**[0:57:14-0:57:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:57:14):**  And so it's just opening all those light pathways to connect.  
**[0:57:18-0:57:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:57:18):**  I agree.  
**[0:57:19-0:57:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:57:19):**  We're living at such an exciting time as never before have we been able to access such vast  
**[0:57:26-0:57:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:57:26):**  communities and connectivity through the Internet, through all the technology that we have access  
**[0:57:31-0:57:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:57:31):**  to.  
**[0:57:32-0:57:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:57:32):**  And I'm determined to find the most productive, the most beautiful, the most equitable way  
**[0:57:38-0:57:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:57:38):**  of sharing information and helping to give voice to many people who have been silenced  
**[0:57:44-0:57:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:57:44):**  or ignored in the past.  
**[0:57:45-0:57:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:57:45):**  And one of the big aspects of the Bloom Network and your experience in community organization  
**[0:57:51-0:57:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:57:51):**  that really inspired me to get in touch.  
**[0:57:53-0:57:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:57:53):**  Now, as we wrap up here, can you give us some contact information of how listeners can get  
**[0:57:59-0:58:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:57:59):**  in touch with the Bloom Network, perhaps even sign up or start a new chapter and any other  
**[0:58:03-0:58:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:58:03):**  resources that you would like to give out to our audience?  
**[0:58:08-0:58:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:58:08):**  Sure.  
**[0:58:09-0:58:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:58:09):**  Our main website is bloomnetwork.org and you'll find our contact info there.  
**[0:58:15-0:58:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:58:15):**  You can connect with us via email at community at bloomnetwork.org.  
**[0:58:21-0:58:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:58:21):**  We're on social media on Instagram as Bloom Network and on Facebook and Twitter because  
**[0:58:26-0:58:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:58:26):**  our name is very generic.  
**[0:58:28-0:58:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:58:28):**  Our URL is our Bloom Network.  
**[0:58:30-0:58:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:58:30):**  O-U-R Bloom Network.  
**[0:58:32-0:58:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:58:32):**  Let's see.  
**[0:58:34-0:58:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:58:34):**  Our conference website is bloompollination.com or you can find that through our main website  
**[0:58:41-0:58:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:58:41):**  and that will eventually be happening in multiple cities at one time.  
**[0:58:44-0:58:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:58:44):**  So years down the road, you'll be able to help create that and be part of it.  
**[0:58:50-0:58:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:58:50):**  Forming a local chapter, it's really clear on our website, it says local blooms or fight  
**[0:58:54-0:58:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:58:54):**  the bloom and there you'll find what current chapters are doing and then also a link to  
**[0:58:58-0:59:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:58:58):**  kind of what's involved in starting one.  
**[0:59:00-0:59:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:59:00):**  We try to make it really easy for people, like even if you just host like a monthly  
**[0:59:04-0:59:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:59:04):**  potluck or something to get going rather than producing like an elaborate event or something,  
**[0:59:09-0:59:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:59:09):**  that can be surprisingly effective.  
**[0:59:11-0:59:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:59:11):**  So we try to make that access as open as possible or if you want to tie your existing initiative  
**[0:59:18-0:59:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:59:18):**  to Bloom Network, we're kind of working on ways to do that, but really, you know, please  
**[0:59:23-0:59:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:59:23):**  get in touch if you want to connect with this thing in any way.  
**[0:59:27-0:59:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:59:27):**  Like I said, we're really designing it in a collaborative, open, receptive way.  
**[0:59:32-0:59:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:59:32):**  And so people can contribute to the leadership of this thing.  
**[0:59:36-0:59:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:59:36):**  So yeah, bloomnetwork.org is the main space.  
**[0:59:39-0:59:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:59:39):**  Any other, were you mostly asking where to find us?  
**[0:59:44-0:59:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:59:44):**  Did I miss a question in there?  
**[0:59:45-0:59:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:59:45):**  No, just if you have any other links or resources that you'd like to share with our listeners.  
**[0:59:50-0:59:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:59:50):**  Oh yeah, definitely check out the wiki on our website.  
**[0:59:54-1:00:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=0:59:54):**  I've kind of populated it with just a few articles so you can get the sense of what  
**[1:00:00-1:00:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=1:00:00):**  kinds of things you'll find there.  
**[1:00:03-1:00:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=1:00:03):**  And actually after this call, I will upload a link to our, I made like this kind of a  
**[1:00:10-1:00:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=1:00:10):**  sketch of our index.  
**[1:00:12-1:00:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=1:00:12):**  And I think even just looking at that, you'll see the kind of cross-sectional framework  
**[1:00:19-1:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=1:00:19):**  of how we're kind of bringing visibility and collaborative capacity across these different  
**[1:00:25-1:00:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=1:00:25):**  aspects of social movements that we consider collectively to be regenerative.  
**[1:00:30-1:00:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=1:00:30):**  That might help make some lights go on for people.  
**[1:00:32-1:00:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=1:00:32):**  So that's the wiki on our website.  
**[1:00:38-1:00:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=1:00:38):**  We have a podcast as well.  
**[1:00:40-1:00:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=1:00:40):**  It's just called Bloom Podcast and I host that.  
**[1:00:43-1:00:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=1:00:43):**  So if people want to be a host on that or have ideas of what they'd like to see specifically,  
**[1:00:49-1:00:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=1:00:49):**  you can get in touch on that.  
**[1:00:51-1:00:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=1:00:51):**  And then our community call.  
**[1:00:52-1:00:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=1:00:52):**  So once a month, third Wednesdays every month, we meet online via Zoom.  
**[1:00:57-1:01:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=1:00:57):**  You can call in, get different international numbers as well if you have low internet connection.  
**[1:01:02-1:01:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=1:01:02):**  And right now, like I said, those are really open.  
**[1:01:05-1:01:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=1:01:05):**  We kind of give an update on what the network, where the network's at and then just kind  
**[1:01:09-1:01:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=1:01:09):**  of have open peer sharing.  
**[1:01:11-1:01:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=1:01:11):**  People have been sharing tools and resources and questions and starting to network build.  
**[1:01:17-1:01:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=1:01:17):**  And then gradually we're starting to fill in more kind of educational skill shares and  
**[1:01:23-1:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=1:01:23):**  panel discussions through that call as well.  
**[1:01:25-1:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=1:01:25):**  So there's a stronger education piece happening, but those are the things.  
**[1:01:29-1:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=1:01:29):**  Excellent.  
**[1:01:30-1:01:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=1:01:30):**  And I'm just going to add one more thing because I feel like I'd be remiss if you and I were  
**[1:01:33-1:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=1:01:33):**  the only two voices talking about how to help to empower new voices and new demographics  
**[1:01:39-1:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=1:01:39):**  in these discussions around regenerative culture building.  
**[1:01:42-1:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=1:01:42):**  But I did a podcast a little while ago with the incredible author Leah Pennyman who wrote  
**[1:01:47-1:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=1:01:47):**  Farming While Black and is a co-founder of Soul Fire Farm.  
**[1:01:51-1:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=1:01:51):**  And she speaks in depth about many of the topics that we talked about and how people  
**[1:01:56-1:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=1:01:56):**  of our own demographics as the dominant culture since colonialization can actively work to  
**[1:02:02-1:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=1:02:02):**  help to promote and empower new voices in these conversations.  
**[1:02:06-1:02:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=1:02:06):**  So I'll send a link to that as well as all of the resources that you just mentioned on  
**[1:02:11-1:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=1:02:11):**  the show notes for this episode on the website.  
**[1:02:14-1:02:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=1:02:14):**  So Magenta, thank you so much for taking the time today.  
**[1:02:17-1:02:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=1:02:17):**  It's been such a pleasure talking to you.

**[1:02:22-1:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=1:02:22):**  anything that I can help to contribute to this network and get wonderful work that you

**[1:02:35-1:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=1:02:35):**  And yeah, you bring a lot of beautiful flourishing to my heart and to my knowledge of what's  
**[1:02:43-1:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=1:02:43):**  happening on this planet right now.  
**[1:02:45-1:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-magenta-ceiba/#t=1:02:45):**  Well, thank you.

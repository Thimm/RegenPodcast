**[0:00:00-0:00:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:00:00):**  This is Regenerative Skills, the podcast helping you to learn the skills and solutions to create  
**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:00:12):**  an abundant and connected future.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:00:14):**  I'm your host, Oliver Gaucher.  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:00:17):**  I am once again honored to be representing my friends at New Society Publishers, the  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:00:22):**  book publishers that were a big inspiration to me even before I started working with ecologies  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:00:27):**  and natural buildings and way before podcasting.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:00:31):**  Their titles like The Natural Plaster Book and Timber Framing for the Rest of Us really  
**[0:00:36-0:00:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:00:36):**  made me believe that I could build my own home, which I eventually did.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:00:40):**  And later volumes like Ecopreneuring, Unlearn Re Wild, and Building Community have offered  
**[0:00:45-0:00:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:00:45):**  tons of inspiration and even helped to shape my worldview.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:00:49):**  Whether you're looking for practical tips on growing and preserving food, exploring  
**[0:00:53-0:00:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:00:53):**  complex challenges in your own life, or sometimes just searching for hope and inspiration in  
**[0:00:57-0:01:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:00:57):**  a crazy world where you don't feel like you fit in, you'll find exactly what you're  
**[0:01:02-0:01:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:01:02):**  looking for and more at newsociety.com.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:01:04):**  Hey everybody and welcome to the 10th of the monthly expert panel calls.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:01:10):**  As I mentioned before, each month I'll be hosting discussions and debates between some  
**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:01:14):**  of the most prominent voices in regenerative agriculture, soil science, restoration land  
**[0:01:19-0:01:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:01:19):**  management and a lot more.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:01:21):**  In this session I hosted a discussion on innovative marketing and sales strategies for farms with  
**[0:01:26-0:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:01:26):**  my friends and colleagues at Climate Farmers, a non-profit organization working to build  
**[0:01:30-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:01:30):**  the infrastructure to scale regenerative agriculture in Europe.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:01:35):**  In this panel I invited Alfonso Guzman, the former head of the Alvala Cooperative in the  
**[0:01:39-0:01:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:01:39):**  Altiplano region of Spain, and Stefan Subkojak of Miracle Farm and the Permaculture Orchard  
**[0:01:45-0:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:01:45):**  Film.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:01:46):**  Each of them come from a background in regenerative agroforestry systems, but that's where most  
**[0:01:50-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:01:50):**  of the similarities end.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:01:52):**  Alfonso has helped to organize a growing network of farmers in one of the fastest desertifying  
**[0:01:57-0:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:01:57):**  regions in Europe to transition to regenerative farming practices by planting profitable tree  
**[0:02:03-0:02:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:02:03):**  species that do well in dry regions, things like almonds, and through that he's focusing  
**[0:02:08-0:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:02:08):**  on restoring soil health and integrating animals.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:02:12):**  Through the creation of the Almondresa brand of regeneratively produced almonds, they've  
**[0:02:17-0:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:02:17):**  helped to significantly increase farmer earnings so that they can reinvest in their natural  
**[0:02:21-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:02:21):**  capital in these local communities.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:02:24):**  Stefan on the other hand is working at a much smaller scale, and for decades he has demonstrated  
**[0:02:29-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:02:29):**  innovative ways not only to bring holistic health and biodiversity back to the conventional  
**[0:02:34-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:02:34):**  orchard that he has revived using permaculture methods, but has also pioneered a UPIC business  
**[0:02:39-0:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:02:39):**  model that focuses on the experiences and relationships that customers have with his  
**[0:02:44-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:02:44):**  farm.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:02:45):**  In this discussion, both Alfonso and Stefan go into great detail, not only about their  
**[0:02:50-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:02:50):**  farm operations and businesses and how they work, but also the challenges that they've  
**[0:02:55-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:02:55):**  overcome along the way, and the unique aspects of their management that have helped them  
**[0:02:58-0:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:02:58):**  to stand out from the competition and increase their sales and profits as well.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:03:04):**  Now I'll give one disclaimer that the audio quality on this chat isn't the best.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:03:08):**  I've done my best to clean things up, but bear with me through some rough connection  
**[0:03:11-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:03:11):**  issues.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:03:12):**  I think of it as a bit of turbulence on the flight, but don't worry, I'll get us to our  
**[0:03:15-0:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:03:15):**  destination safely.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:03:18):**  Also don't forget that if you want to hear the full unedited version of this interview  
**[0:03:21-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:03:21):**  with the entire Q&A session at the end, just be sure to check out the different subscription  
**[0:03:25-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:03:25):**  options on Regenerative Skills Patreon page.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:03:29):**  Now since these discussions are longer than the regular weekly episodes, I'll keep the  
**[0:03:32-0:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:03:32):**  intro short and jump right into the introductions for our panelists.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:03:37):**  So let's start with Alfonso.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:03:39):**  Hello.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:03:40):**  Thank you also for the very generous input.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:03:45):**  What we have been doing in Albelal and through Almondresa is a bit of a hybrid model.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:03:50):**  So instead of selling directly each farmer, we created a cooperative, and then we put  
**[0:03:55-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:03:55):**  the production together there because some farmers are full time, others not full time,  
**[0:04:01-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:04:01):**  and some have more production than others and more capacity than others to be able to  
**[0:04:06-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:04:06):**  market and sell those products.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:04:09):**  And through Almondresa, we, I don't know if this is the moment to explain a bit more or  
**[0:04:14-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:04:14):**  or or or go ahead, you can give a profile of how that works.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:04:20):**  Yeah.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:04:21):**  So what we did there is we started 21 farmers that were doing regenerative agriculture practices  
**[0:04:27-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:04:27):**  in our farms.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:04:29):**  And we wanted to market our products as that.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:04:33):**  So with the help of Albelal and Commonland, we could do some market research and hired  
**[0:04:41-0:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:04:41):**  an expert in marketing products and selling that things that are organic and in this case,  
**[0:04:50-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:04:50):**  beyond organic, we all had the certification of organic.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:04:53):**  But at that moment, there is no certification for doing any of the regenerative practices  
**[0:04:58-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:04:58):**  we were doing.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:05:00):**  And then we started with a smaller production and have been growing in the last years.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:05:04):**  And also more people have been joining in selling their products, but also some of those  
**[0:05:09-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:05:09):**  now they created their own cooperative to organize it better, and to also be a bit more  
**[0:05:15-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:05:15):**  decentralized.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:05:16):**  And that's working really well in the sense that it has a much higher demand than what  
**[0:05:21-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:05:21):**  we can offer as a production.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:05:23):**  And we are growing more and more farmers are participating.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:05:26):**  I think now we are more than 40 farmers selling our production through there.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:05:31):**  But yeah, there's just one client that would like to buy 10 times more than what we produce  
**[0:05:38-0:05:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:05:38):**  all together combined.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:05:39):**  I think we have around, yeah, last year was thing near 200,000 kilograms of, of almonds  
**[0:05:49-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:05:49):**  in shell.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:05:51):**  But yeah, we need to get more.  
**[0:05:54-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:05:54):**  So that's a bit of a, that is quite an effort to get to other people, to other farmers that  
**[0:06:00-0:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:06:00):**  they are committed to this, that they don't join just practice controlling erosion, the  
**[0:06:08-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:06:08):**  improving soil.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:06:10):**  There's certain things that have to do on how you farm your farm is.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:06:15):**  But for example, you have to add organic matter to the soil, at least every other year.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:06:19):**  If you don't have enough biodiversity, you need to have hedges and borders that you should  
**[0:06:23-0:06:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:06:23):**  plant some aromatic plants or other things, depending on how your farm is.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:06:29):**  You should leave a full ground cover at least autumn and winter.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:06:33):**  And then slowly you should move into improving that ground cover within other months of the  
**[0:06:39-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:06:39):**  year through lines of vegetation or similar things.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:06:44):**  And you have a lot of erosion also, you should with the years, build more swales, dams, ponds,  
**[0:06:53-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:06:53):**  and these lines of vegetation or these hedges that go on key line or contour, things like  
**[0:06:58-0:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:06:58):**  that.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:06:59):**  So in a way, the marketing them through this and getting that extra price, let's say the  
**[0:07:03-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:07:03):**  client is helping you finance their regeneration of your plots.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:07:08):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:07:09):**  Yeah, we're going to come back to this model.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:07:11):**  And this is one of the reasons why I really wanted you on this panel, because there are  
**[0:07:14-0:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:07:14):**  a lot of people who are producing at a large scale.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:07:17):**  And it's not practical, especially if they're part time farmers to be handling all of their  
**[0:07:22-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:07:22):**  direct marketing themselves.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:07:23):**  So we'll come back to that.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:07:24):**  And Stefan, great to have you here again.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:07:27):**  Can you tell our listeners about your innovative, you pick market for your agroforestry crops,  
**[0:07:34-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:07:34):**  as well as many of the other things that you have integrated in order to sell a variety  
**[0:07:38-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:07:38):**  of products to your customers?  
**[0:07:41-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:07:41):**  Yes, thank you, Oliver.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:07:44):**  Your question originally was, why should we direct market?  
**[0:07:49-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:07:49):**  That's true.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:07:50):**  Let's go back to the beginning.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:07:51):**  And the why is really important.  
**[0:07:54-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:07:54):**  I like my original spark for doing not just direct marketing, because I've done direct  
**[0:08:00-0:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:08:00):**  marketing the whole time.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:08:03):**  But you pick, which is really unknown.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:08:07):**  It's hardly known in Europe, from what I've seen, maybe in Spain, it is.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:08:12):**  But certainly in France and Canada as well.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:08:17):**  It was Booker T. Watley in his book, 100,000 Firming, 25 Acres, and that was written in  
**[0:08:23-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:08:23):**  1980.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:08:26):**  And he said, the difference is, do you want to be a price taker?  
**[0:08:31-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:08:31):**  Or do you want to be a price maker?  
**[0:08:33-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:08:33):**  And that's a huge difference.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:08:35):**  If you're farming a crop, and you bring it to a distributor, you're not making a price.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:08:41):**  You're he's saying, well, this is the price I'm giving you.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:08:44):**  Let's take it or leave it.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:08:47):**  That's not very interesting to me.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:08:48):**  I much rather say, well, you know what, this year, we don't have as much of this, I'm going  
**[0:08:52-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:08:52):**  to raise my price, and people will take it or leave it.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:08:57):**  But if there isn't a big supply, it allows you to do that.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:09:00):**  And that's, to me, the one of the most important is being able to set a price and adjust it  
**[0:09:07-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:09:07):**  as you like.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:09:08):**  Yeah, that's essential.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:09:10):**  And so do you want to give us an overview of how it is that you move the products that  
**[0:09:13-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:09:13):**  you produce?  
**[0:09:14-0:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:09:14):**  Yeah, so we do it, it's a you pick, which is people come to the farm and they pick.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:09:22):**  So it's really that you pick it.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:09:25):**  That's the whole model of you pick.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:09:27):**  That's twist to it is that we are not open to the public.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:09:32):**  We're only open to people who have signed up and are members.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:09:36):**  So they join it costs them in this year $60 a year.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:09:41):**  In a $60 membership, I put a $20 coupon.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:09:45):**  So on if they want the first $20 worth of product that they pick, it's no charge, it's  
**[0:09:53-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:09:53):**  it's right on the coupon.  
**[0:09:54-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:09:54):**  And then anything else, then either they pay or this year, what's been really working really  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:10:00):**  well oddly is we had a huge crop of apples.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:10:05):**  I mean, we have a it was a problem.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:10:08):**  The problem is that there's too much of it, what am I going to do with it?  
**[0:10:12-0:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:10:12):**  And I'm not interested in picking crop kilos.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:10:16):**  So people got the email, their members and they go, wow, this was new because it wasn't  
**[0:10:21-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:10:21):**  even in the original agreement for membership.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:10:23):**  It's just because we had too much apples.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:10:26):**  So normally we sell apples at $1.50 a pound, which works out to, yeah, on 160 it's $240  
**[0:10:34-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:10:34):**  of crop that we're giving them free just for being a member just because hey, this year  
**[0:10:38-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:10:38):**  we got a lot.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:10:39):**  It's a problem crop.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:10:40):**  I mean, it's a good problem for them.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:10:42):**  So whenever I have a problem with the crop, I like to transfer it onto the members.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:10:47):**  And now it's up to you to deal with it.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:10:49):**  And it's been very impressive.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:10:51):**  Our early apples have been absolutely cleaned out, which is fantastic because there's no  
**[0:10:56-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:10:56):**  waste.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:10:57):**  But we've also so it's like, well, where are you making your money?  
**[0:11:00-0:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:11:00):**  Because you're giving away all this crop.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:11:03):**  We've had great weekends because that has been a big draw.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:11:07):**  So there has been a lot of people and when they come, oh, well, oh, you also are, you're  
**[0:11:12-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:11:12):**  selling eggs.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:11:13):**  So we've been sold out of eggs.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:11:14):**  Oh, you have some pears.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:11:16):**  We've been sold out of pears.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:11:18):**  We have cider vinegar.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:11:20):**  So we've been, we don't do that.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:11:22):**  It's free people.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:11:25):**  And then we sell the other.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:11:29):**  So it's a, it's an interesting model.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:11:31):**  I definitely wouldn't go back to trying to sell in stores or in markets.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:11:36):**  It's so much less work.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:11:38):**  I mean, I opened the gate, people drive in, they park, they go, they pick, and then they  
**[0:11:42-0:11:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:11:42):**  pay me and they buy other things on the way out.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:11:45):**  So that's much simpler.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:11:48):**  And if you make the draw worthwhile, if you offer something that people really will come  
**[0:11:54-0:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:11:54):**  because as opposed to Europe, we're a mile a mile, we're one hour away from Montreal,  
**[0:12:02-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:12:02):**  which is the largest city around.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:12:05):**  And to really work well, you want to be within half an hour of 30,000 people.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:12:11):**  That's the model.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:12:12):**  And we're not in that range.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:12:14):**  So we need something to be attractive to have people come out.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:12:19):**  Yeah, and so in talking about this unique model that you have that involves getting  
**[0:12:25-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:12:25):**  rid of a lot of the overhead, which is the harvesting cost for these agroforestry crops,  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:12:30):**  mostly the fruit that you produce, and it being a major draw for people to buy other  
**[0:12:35-0:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:12:35):**  products, what have been some of the biggest challenges in this business model?  
**[0:12:40-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:12:40):**  It's a rainy day.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:12:42):**  It won't work always the way you hope to.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:12:46):**  That's really, you gotta be flexible.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:12:47):**  It's not like, and be willing, and if it's needed, be willing to harvest some crop.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:12:52):**  I really don't want to harvest much.  
**[0:12:54-0:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:12:54):**  So what we do is when we have too much still left, we just put tarps and we shake the crop,  
**[0:13:01-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:13:01):**  we shake the trees, we pick them on the tarp, we bag them all and we sell them just bagged  
**[0:13:06-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:13:06):**  as they come.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:13:08):**  Actually, we sell probably more to deer hunters than to anybody else because they don't care  
**[0:13:17-0:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:13:17):**  what the quality is.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:13:19):**  It's going for the deer in the woods.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:13:21):**  And so that's actually an oddly simple market, and this happens to be the time when people  
**[0:13:27-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:13:27):**  are beginning to feed deer and to prepare them for deer hunting season.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:13:33):**  That's a really cool story.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:13:34):**  I wouldn't have thought that deer hunters would be a major market for apples like that.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:13:39):**  Alfonso, can you tell me about some of the challenges that your cooperative model and  
**[0:13:43-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:13:43):**  bringing together many different producers has been in either figuring out quality control  
**[0:13:49-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:13:49):**  of the product that you're putting out or simply just getting a consensus with working  
**[0:13:53-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:13:53):**  so much with so many people?  
**[0:13:56-0:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:13:56):**  Yeah, there's always many, of course, once you when you work with that model.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:14:04):**  But things that I can think of, well, difference in management of how you do things.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:14:13):**  We set up certain standards of how clean the product has to come, also on the dates of  
**[0:14:23-0:14:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:14:23):**  when they have to come and all of that.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:14:26):**  But a lot of people are not really used to that.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:14:29):**  They're used to just like pick it up and then put it in their transport that maybe they  
**[0:14:35-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:14:35):**  haven't really cleaned it up well enough before that, or maybe that they just want to do it  
**[0:14:40-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:14:40):**  today because they are used to bring it to these very big cooperatives that work in the  
**[0:14:44-0:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:14:44):**  area and they just take it and say, hey, if you don't bring it super clean, you have to  
**[0:14:49-0:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:14:49):**  take it back to your home.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:14:50):**  We are not receiving it.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:14:52):**  And especially the first year, some got really angry about that.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:14:56):**  Now it's not a problem anymore, but the beginning of it was quite a challenge.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:15:00):**  And as Sam said, OK, then I'm leaving and I'm never going to do this again.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:15:03):**  And they maybe didn't understand that those first standards, because also this area was  
**[0:15:09-0:15:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:15:09):**  a place that there is a high production in this case of almonds.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:15:12):**  But there is not really any brand or direct selling of this product coming out from here.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:15:18):**  But at the same time is, I think, one of the best quality almonds you can find in the world.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:15:24):**  And so Rainfeld, the production is not very high, but the quality is.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:15:29):**  And there is a huge potential there.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:15:32):**  But there is not a history of selling it like that.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:15:38):**  Wanted to start selling very fast, but we didn't have the right bags.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:15:42):**  We didn't have the right design.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:15:43):**  And the manager we hired was a very perfectionistic person.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:15:46):**  And many of us, I must admit, I was included in that group.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:15:49):**  We just wanted to start as a, come on, don't be so picky.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:15:52):**  Just to start sending it, start selling it.  
**[0:15:55-0:15:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:15:55):**  We don't have to wait until everything is very perfect.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:15:58):**  But fortunately, he didn't listen to us.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:16:01):**  And he waited until everything in the package was made of like some vegetable material.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:16:13):**  And it was composable and easily to recycle.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:16:17):**  And it was like that time, it was four years ago, the first time that we saw a package  
**[0:16:21-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:16:21):**  like that in a product like this.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:16:23):**  So it was, it had really good consequences, but we had to learn to be patient.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:16:28):**  And we had to learn on how all of that worked because we were the ones making decisions,  
**[0:16:33-0:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:16:33):**  but we didn't really have a lot of experience in making decisions of things like that.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:16:39):**  Sometimes it's not as easy as you would think to make a decision or a strategic decision  
**[0:16:44-0:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:16:44):**  especially.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:16:45):**  But yeah, with time and you're persistent enough, you end up.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:16:51):**  It's going well.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:16:52):**  So it must be that we are doing it well.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:16:54):**  Yeah, that's quite an incredible journey of the startup and the coordination of so many  
**[0:16:59-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:16:59):**  moving parts.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:17:00):**  And Stefan, I'm interested in what was the startup process for your business model?  
**[0:17:05-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:17:05):**  I recognize that it's a little bit more common in Canada to do you pick.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:17:09):**  And so you didn't have to start from scratch.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:17:12):**  But given how you manage your orchard and some of the unique things that you offer,  
**[0:17:17-0:17:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:17:17):**  was that an asset to bringing people further out in order to find you?  
**[0:17:23-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:17:23):**  Or were there some hurdles along the way to the marketing side of things?  
**[0:17:29-0:17:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:17:29):**  Yeah, it was that way of doing it, especially by membership was not, it wasn't known.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:17:36):**  Nobody had done that in this region.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:17:39):**  So people were used to, oh, it's a you pick.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:17:42):**  So you can just come in, in open days and come and pick.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:17:46):**  So in the beginning, because I had tried being open, just open to the public, I did that  
**[0:17:52-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:17:52):**  in the in the beginning.  
**[0:17:55-0:18:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:17:55):**  Actually in the first three years we started, we were open to members.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:18:00):**  And that worked for two years.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:18:02):**  And then we had one crop failure.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:18:05):**  And that was when it was just transitioning to organic and it was just an apple orchard.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:18:10):**  So the first they want to leave like you do when you go to grocery store and you don't  
**[0:18:16-0:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:18:16):**  go for just say almonds, you'll go and you'll get almonds and you'll get some bread and  
**[0:18:21-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:18:21):**  you'll get some eggs and you'll get whatever else you need.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:18:24):**  So the first people who came, they would ask me, okay, I got two boxes of apples.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:18:29):**  What else do you have?  
**[0:18:32-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:18:32):**  That's when I realized, well, I got a problem here because I only have all kinds.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:18:35):**  So I'd say I have another kind of apples.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:18:37):**  No, no, we don't want more kinds of apples.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:18:39):**  We got enough apples.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:18:41):**  We want something else just to and you have to put yourself in somebody's mind if they've  
**[0:18:45-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:18:45):**  driven an hour or 45 minutes to get to your farm, they want to make it worthwhile for  
**[0:18:53-0:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:18:53):**  their travels.  
**[0:18:55-0:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:18:55):**  So you always, if you want to attract people that way, you have to make it worthwhile.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:18:59):**  That might mean it's worth it just for the whatever is free.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:19:05):**  And you can't look at free as really being a loss to you, because if it's what draws  
**[0:19:11-0:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:19:11):**  people to then pay and I, my price is not rebated, it's about the same as conventional  
**[0:19:18-0:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:19:18):**  prices in stores.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:19:20):**  So if imagine, I don't know what's a big supermarket chain in Spain, but imagine you go to that  
**[0:19:26-0:19:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:19:26):**  store and you're buying, for example, Alfonso, you know, he's not the only one selling almonds  
**[0:19:33-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:19:33):**  in Spain, I'm pretty sure.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:19:35):**  So if people are used to paying non-organic and they'll pay, what's the price, Alfonso,  
**[0:19:41-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:19:41):**  for almonds in Spain?  
**[0:19:44-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:19:44):**  It depends.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:19:45):**  There is an increasing difference between organic and conventional.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:19:50):**  Yeah, but conventional.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:19:51):**  But to be honest, I'm not sure what is the price in the supermarket.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:19:57):**  I know what is the price that we get as farmers, but it is around five euros for the conventional  
**[0:20:04-0:20:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:20:04):**  and around nine euros something for the organic.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:20:07):**  Okay.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:20:08):**  Per kilo, yeah.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:20:09):**  Per kilo, per kilo.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:20:10):**  Yeah.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:20:11):**  Yeah.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:20:12):**  So if it's $5 a kilo, conventional, you're using organic prices, you'd go, gee, this  
**[0:20:20-0:20:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:20:20):**  is, this is really a great price because you get it at the price of conventional, but it's  
**[0:20:25-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:20:25):**  not conventional.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:20:26):**  So right there, that's a drop.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:20:28):**  But the big point of it all is the savings if you don't have to pick and picking is one  
**[0:20:35-0:20:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:20:35):**  cost and picking is a major cost because normally in most crops, picking and packing, and people  
**[0:20:43-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:20:43):**  always underestimate the cost of packing, which might in some cases be a cleaning.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:20:48):**  It might be a washing, but all in all cases, it's also a packaging or a boxing or a, you  
**[0:20:55-0:20:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:20:55):**  know, putting it in some kind of a container.  
**[0:20:57-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:20:57):**  Some of the containers don't come back to you.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:21:00):**  So that, that cost is usually about 40% of the cost of production.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:21:06):**  Well, there's a 40% margin for you to work on.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:21:11):**  If you had to do it, it would cost you that 40%.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:21:16):**  So even if I give crop away, I'm not losing, it didn't cost me other than growing it, but  
**[0:21:22-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:21:22):**  that 40% is not in it.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:21:25):**  And in fact, my cost to grow it is minimal.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:21:28):**  I mean, it's minimal spray and what I spray, I could drink, so I get it for free.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:21:33):**  So it's, yeah, that's not a big item of cost.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:21:37):**  It's the harvesting that would be for me, a big item of cost normally.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:21:42):**  So by eliminating that, anything I get on the crop is just a bonus because the other  
**[0:21:49-0:21:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:21:49):**  thing that happens is if I pick and I grade it, I'm much more strict.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:21:56):**  You know, I'm sure you see the same, but well, this almond isn't, it wouldn't go in the,  
**[0:22:01-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:22:01):**  in the retail bag, but when people come and pick and I see what they picked and I go,  
**[0:22:07-0:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:22:07):**  eat, you know, this one, you wouldn't, you don't want to eat this one.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:22:11):**  I know it would have a worm in it or this one, you know, it's doesn't matter.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:22:17):**  They'll say, you know, it doesn't matter, I'm going to cut it and I'll, I'll cut around  
**[0:22:21-0:22:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:22:21):**  it.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:22:22):**  So it's like, wow, they're paying retail for things that I wouldn't even have put in a  
**[0:22:28-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:22:28):**  basket.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:22:29):**  So right there, it's like, you know, and I'll tell, no, it's okay.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:22:32):**  It doesn't matter that three weeks ago we had pears and we've been, we've had a very  
**[0:22:36-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:22:36):**  warm summer and so things were ripe two weeks ahead of time and we had a pear day and people  
**[0:22:44-0:22:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:22:44):**  pick pears and we bought, we brought a box of pears home and within two days we started  
**[0:22:50-0:22:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:22:50):**  to open them up and I realized, wow, the pears are gone.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:22:54):**  They're overripe.  
**[0:22:55-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:22:55):**  I didn't realize they had ripened that much.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:22:58):**  So I sent everybody who I saw had bought pears.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:23:01):**  I sent them an email and I said, Hey, listen, if you want, I'll give you a refund on your  
**[0:23:06-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:23:06):**  pears because they, they didn't work.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:23:08):**  They were, they were overripe and only one person said, no, it's okay.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:23:13):**  We cut it off and we cut around it and it's okay.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:23:16):**  We had a great day and some people were like, you know what?  
**[0:23:18-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:23:18):**  It was so much fun.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:23:20):**  That's fine.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:23:21):**  It was because when people come to pick, they're not picking, like if I'm picking to harvest  
**[0:23:27-0:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:23:27):**  crop, they're picking as entertainment.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:23:31):**  If I looked and I go, okay, I'd have to pick this much in this amount of time.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:23:36):**  They, they're relaxed.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:23:38):**  They're taking their time.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:23:39):**  They'll be there for three or four hours in the day and they'll pick, you know, two boxes  
**[0:23:44-0:23:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:23:44):**  or let's say 40 kilos in two hours.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:23:48):**  That's fine.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:23:49):**  You know, they're taking their time.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:23:50):**  They're walking around and I'll look and I have certain rows closed and I'll look at  
**[0:23:55-0:23:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:23:55):**  what they fixed.  
**[0:23:56-0:23:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:23:56):**  And I, I realized they've been picking in the rows that were closed.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:23:59):**  They're not even right.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:24:01):**  And I'll say, you know, it's okay.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:24:03):**  It doesn't matter.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:24:04):**  We had a great time.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:24:06):**  So that aspect of it's no longer just about the crop.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:24:11):**  It's about the entertainment.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:24:13):**  And so I always say that you have to know what business are you in?  
**[0:24:18-0:24:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:24:18):**  I'm not in the business of growing fruit.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:24:20):**  You think, well, yeah, it's a permaculture orchard, you know, no, I'm in the business  
**[0:24:25-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:24:25):**  of creating memories.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:24:27):**  That's my most important business.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:24:29):**  So when people come, anything that for them will click and connect and they go, you know  
**[0:24:35-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:24:35):**  what, I remember the time I came five years from now, they'll remember the day they came  
**[0:24:41-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:24:41):**  and that, that idea of creating a memory for them, you know, they'll say, yeah, we were  
**[0:24:45-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:24:45):**  out walking around in the orchard and, and we picked some pears and my gosh, they were  
**[0:24:50-0:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:24:50):**  the best pears we've ever eaten or something.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:24:52):**  Well, that's the kind of memories you want to create for them.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:24:56):**  And even if they're not totally positive, like I said, for the pears that they were  
**[0:25:01-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:25:01):**  overripe, we try to make it good so that you know what, you got a bad batch, they were  
**[0:25:06-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:25:06):**  overripe, I'll refund you.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:25:09):**  And they don't even take me up on it.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:25:11):**  Like they'll say, No, it's okay.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:25:13):**  You know, that's that was only $10 or whatever.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:25:16):**  That's fine.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:25:18):**  And so that's, it's not, you're not dealing with the public.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:25:23):**  You're dealing with members and members.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:25:26):**  It's more than just it.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:25:27):**  They're not the public, they become friends.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:25:29):**  I mean, you get to know their kids, the kids grow up year after year, you see them growing  
**[0:25:33-0:25:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:25:33):**  up in.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:25:34):**  And it's a whole different relationship.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:25:37):**  I would much rather and Joel Salatin, I'm sure, you know, Joel Salatin, he always said,  
**[0:25:44-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:25:44):**  you're way better off selling 100 families $1,000, then you are selling 1000 families  
**[0:25:54-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:25:54):**  $100.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:25:56):**  And when you get that, I mean, that is so much the truth.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:26:01):**  You much rather form a strong relationship with a smaller number of people.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:26:06):**  But you really serve them, you you will help them you do what you have to do so that they  
**[0:26:11-0:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:26:11):**  get great food.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:26:12):**  And they'll reward you forever.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:26:14):**  I mean, it's that relationship building.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:26:16):**  So yeah, I'm not serving all the public.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:26:18):**  I'm not trying to feed, you know, everybody in a whole region.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:26:21):**  I'm looking to feed a select group of families that preferably they actually stay with us  
**[0:26:27-0:26:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:26:27):**  year after year.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:26:29):**  Because that's where you build a business.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:26:31):**  It's not trying to get new customers every few months or every few years.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:26:35):**  It's trying to serve the same group year after year.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:26:38):**  That's what makes a really simple and strong business and predictable.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:26:42):**  You have a good idea.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:26:43):**  I know what I'll how much I'll have next year in business, just because people come back.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:26:48):**  Yeah, that's fantastic.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:26:50):**  And like you said, it really is creating relationships and memories that you're focused on and that  
**[0:26:55-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:26:55):**  people keep coming back for rather than just the produce itself.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:26:58):**  Now of course, Alfonso, you're working on a very different scale.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:27:02):**  And in order to move the type of product that you can start to create over what probably  
**[0:27:07-0:27:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:27:07):**  over 1000 hectares as a collective within the Alvalao network, right?  
**[0:27:12-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:27:12):**  The needs in the market are very different.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:27:15):**  I believe you said at the beginning that you sell all of this to one buyer.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:27:20):**  Can you give us an idea of what that relationship looks like and how you market these goods  
**[0:27:27-0:27:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:27:27):**  for the amount of quality that they have that differentiates them from the regular wholesale  
**[0:27:33-0:27:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:27:33):**  market?  
**[0:27:34-0:27:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:27:34):**  Yeah, so well, we don't sell only to one buyer, but we could because there is just one of  
**[0:27:39-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:27:39):**  them that would that is willing to buy a lot more than what we can offer.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:27:44):**  But we still decide to have a couple of different clients and to be able to grow year after  
**[0:27:50-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:27:50):**  year with more people coming to sell their almonds with us.  
**[0:27:55-0:28:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:27:55):**  So in the end, we are able to have higher quantities and indeed be able to give them  
**[0:28:02-0:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:28:02):**  what the amounts they want.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:28:04):**  And we don't want to depend only on one client.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:28:07):**  That's not, I think generally a very good idea in business or at least we don't think  
**[0:28:12-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:28:12):**  so.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:28:13):**  But I'm sorry, what was the was there one question?  
**[0:28:19-0:28:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:28:19):**  Well, so beyond just the relationship that you have when dealing with this different  
**[0:28:25-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:28:25):**  model and moving a much larger volume, how do you communicate the added value that your  
**[0:28:30-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:28:30):**  product has that differentiates it from the rest of the wholesale market?  
**[0:28:34-0:28:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:28:34):**  Yeah, so all the clients come and visit, I think most of them every year and some of  
**[0:28:41-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:28:41):**  them every other year.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:28:43):**  And they visit the farms where we produce and then we explain what things we are doing  
**[0:28:49-0:28:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:28:49):**  different and why what we are doing is different and it's worth having a premium price.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:28:58):**  What we are doing with that premium price by investing it back and why that is important  
**[0:29:03-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:29:03):**  for us.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:29:05):**  That is the main way.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:29:06):**  But because some of the clients, they do market it as well as, hey, these elements are special.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:29:14):**  They are from displays from this project and they grow it in this specific way.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:29:20):**  But some others, they don't even say it because they just recognize it to us and they pay  
**[0:29:31-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:29:31):**  us more than others, but they don't have the need maybe to say to their clients that they  
**[0:29:38-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:29:38):**  are more special than any other organic animal that they have.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:29:43):**  But they do pay to us at a higher price than they buy from others.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:29:47):**  So they are quite committed themselves without really getting themselves an extra price.  
**[0:29:53-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:29:53):**  But yeah, the ones that they do, they tell the story.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:30:00):**  They link normally the website of Alvalal, of Almedresa and explain a bit what we're  
**[0:30:05-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:30:05):**  doing.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:30:06):**  And it seems to be quite successful.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:30:09):**  And indeed, that creates that luxury problem of having more demands than.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:30:16):**  So given these two very different sales models, I'm interested from both of your perspectives,  
**[0:30:21-0:30:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:30:21):**  how you went about doing your market research and defining who your ideal client was in  
**[0:30:26-0:30:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:30:26):**  order to send a message exactly to them instead of the spray and pray method that social media  
**[0:30:32-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:30:32):**  often represents or that can lose some of the focus and not really get the value out  
**[0:30:39-0:30:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:30:39):**  of your marketing strategy that otherwise a more direct approach would do.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:30:43):**  So Stefan, you want to start with that?  
**[0:30:45-0:30:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:30:45):**  Yeah, I like the spray and pray.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:30:47):**  That was kind of, I mean, my attitude is just start.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:30:51):**  So we actually started now, this will date you guys, because I can see by your pictures,  
**[0:30:58-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:30:58):**  you probably weren't around when we even started.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:31:01):**  And so we actually started with direct mail.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:31:04):**  So we had, I had accumulated through I had another business before I'd had people's business  
**[0:31:10-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:31:10):**  cards.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:31:11):**  And whoever we knew that we had their address, we simply mailed a letter, inviting them and  
**[0:31:17-0:31:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:31:17):**  explaining what we're doing, and what we're going to have in the coming year and whether  
**[0:31:22-0:31:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:31:22):**  they want to join as members.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:31:23):**  That's how we started, thank God for email.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:31:27):**  And you know, I use MailChimp to handle all the emails.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:31:33):**  That is so much, so much better and and so much cheaper.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:31:37):**  I mean, a mailing used to cost $1 each letter.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:31:41):**  So we would send out the I think the first year we sent out 300 letters.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:31:46):**  And we got about a 10% response, which was a good start.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:31:51):**  But now what happens is, our best long term members are people who are kind of vetted  
**[0:31:59-0:32:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:31:59):**  or or verified by existing members.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:32:03):**  So what we do, and this is really the this is a great year, because when we have so much  
**[0:32:08-0:32:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:32:08):**  free crop, like we're offering these four boxes of apples, most people don't know what  
**[0:32:14-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:32:14):**  to do with a hunt, like 72 kilos of apples, it's like I can't use it myself.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:32:20):**  So I did put in the in the email, this may scare you, this quantity, you may not know  
**[0:32:25-0:32:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:32:25):**  I'm not going to come What am I going to do with 70 kilos of apples?  
**[0:32:29-0:32:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:32:29):**  I don't know what to do.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:32:31):**  So what I did say then is I said, Listen, relax about it.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:32:34):**  Don't worry, invite your friends, invite your family, have them come and they can pick for  
**[0:32:39-0:32:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:32:39):**  free on your membership.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:32:42):**  And that has been great, because hardly anyone has come alone.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:32:46):**  They've always come with other people with friends they want.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:32:49):**  And, and they, I hear them talking, they say, Yeah, you know, next time, I still have two  
**[0:32:53-0:32:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:32:53):**  more, I still have, let's say 30 kilos to pick, I think I'll bring so and so because  
**[0:32:58-0:33:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:32:58):**  this, this is the kind of thing they're involved in.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:33:02):**  So that, to me is the most valuable, how you start, listen, start, if you put the word  
**[0:33:09-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:33:09):**  out social media, and so on, it helps, I mean, yes, I have a YouTube channel, and that helps  
**[0:33:13-0:33:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:33:13):**  a lot.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:33:14):**  But actually, so many of the people that knew this year said, I've been watching your videos  
**[0:33:21-0:33:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:33:21):**  for a few years.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:33:22):**  And so it helps, it's a great way, however, you get the word out, and just talk about  
**[0:33:28-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:33:28):**  what you're doing, you know, like, Alfonso should just do a video on a tour of his, not  
**[0:33:33-0:33:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:33:33):**  just his, but his other members properties.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:33:37):**  And people see that and they connect, because if you ask the first time, hey, do you want  
**[0:33:42-0:33:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:33:42):**  to join?  
**[0:33:44-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:33:44):**  Chances are, they won't, you have to form some form of a relationship, whether it's  
**[0:33:48-0:33:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:33:48):**  social media, whether it's, you know, try direct mail, however you want to do it, or  
**[0:33:54-0:33:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:33:54):**  if you can, free PR has been incredibly useful.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:33:58):**  There are a lot of people who are still in the traditional media, get magazine articles  
**[0:34:04-0:34:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:34:04):**  written about, you know, I can hear Alfonso, your project, I'm sure you would interest  
**[0:34:09-0:34:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:34:09):**  a magazine that is looking in healthy food.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:34:14):**  And they say, wow, we want to profile, you know, a conscious grower, and here's a co-op,  
**[0:34:20-0:34:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:34:20):**  and it Wow.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:34:22):**  And I'll tell you one good article, one article can completely sell you out, just one.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:34:28):**  And I've seen it happen where the right PR, it'll clean you out, you're going to be  
**[0:34:34-0:34:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:34:34):**  fielding, so many emails or telephone calls that you're saying, sorry, you know, and to  
**[0:34:39-0:34:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:34:39):**  be able to say, and this is the power of it to be, if you're turned down, and you go,  
**[0:34:44-0:34:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:34:44):**  what, I can't get in, no, we're full.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:34:47):**  Next, really, because why is it full, it must be a great place.  
**[0:34:53-0:34:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:34:53):**  So if you can say, I'm full, sorry, you'll have to wait next year, get on the mailing  
**[0:34:56-0:35:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:34:56):**  list, and I'll send you starting is tricky.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:35:00):**  Like you know what, start small, and just start because you grow organically, some people  
**[0:35:06-0:35:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:35:06):**  will weed out, it's, it's not a good fit for what you're doing.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:35:11):**  But then the people who are your people, and they know you, and they'll go off, that is,  
**[0:35:17-0:35:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:35:17):**  and once you get if you get 50 families, or you know, that are faithful, and they have  
**[0:35:22-0:35:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:35:22):**  a winter supply of almonds, or whatever you're, you know, I see there's 40 something people  
**[0:35:28-0:35:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:35:28):**  on the call, whatever they're growing, if you get a few faithful people, I mean, that's  
**[0:35:35-0:35:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:35:35):**  all it takes for this crop or the other crop, and you'll be cleaned out.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:35:40):**  So I really is start, let your message get out, because they have, they want to know  
**[0:35:47-0:35:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:35:47):**  you in line with their values are growing the way they want to get, because people want  
**[0:35:53-0:35:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:35:53):**  to reconnect with their food so badly.  
**[0:35:56-0:35:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:35:56):**  It's crazy.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:35:57):**  I mean, I had a couple of three years ago, we had a lady, and that's where it really  
**[0:36:01-0:36:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:36:01):**  made me realize how disconnected people were.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:36:05):**  This lady went to pick in the orchard.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:36:07):**  And right now we have we have chickens in the orchard in different places fenced in.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:36:11):**  And she went, and she came back and said, Oh, you're selling eggs.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:36:16):**  Yeah, I said we're selling eggs just how much more would it be if we go and pick our own  
**[0:36:24-0:36:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:36:24):**  eggs?  
**[0:36:25-0:36:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:36:25):**  I was like, what?  
**[0:36:29-0:36:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:36:29):**  I didn't do that.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:36:30):**  But I was in my head.  
**[0:36:31-0:36:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:36:31):**  I was thinking, this lady wants to pay more if she can go pick her own eggs.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:36:38):**  They'll say because she was with her little daughter, and she wanted to be able to show  
**[0:36:41-0:36:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:36:41):**  her daughter, this is what this is how chickens lay eggs.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:36:45):**  And this is where they are, you just go and you pick them up.  
**[0:36:48-0:36:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:36:48):**  And if you if you don't allow people that connection, you're missing out.  
**[0:36:53-0:36:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:36:53):**  And I know Europe, my goodness, I, you know, I, every time I go to Europe, I just can't  
**[0:36:59-0:37:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:36:59):**  believe it.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:37:00):**  I think we should sell here and move to Europe because starting it in Europe would be so  
**[0:37:04-0:37:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:37:04):**  easy.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:37:06):**  Because you have, I mean, you have so many people close, that whatever you're selling,  
**[0:37:12-0:37:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:37:12):**  you could sell, I'm convinced.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:37:14):**  And if you have diversity that you're selling more than one thing, my goodness, you know,  
**[0:37:20-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:37:20):**  if you could have 10 different crops, those of you grow vegetables, you think yeah, but  
**[0:37:25-0:37:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:37:25):**  this is vegetables, you'd have to wash them, Rita.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:37:29):**  Don't worry, people will be glad to pick up your carrots, they're not washed, they'll  
**[0:37:33-0:37:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:37:33):**  take them home, and they'll wash them.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:37:36):**  You know, they'll pick tomatoes, some of them are cracked, you wouldn't put them in, they'll  
**[0:37:39-0:37:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:37:39):**  take them because they're perfect, they're going to make sauce out of them.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:37:43):**  Don't underestimate and Booker T. Watley used to say, if people want to pick up the rocks  
**[0:37:48-0:37:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:37:48):**  on your property and put them in their basket, no problem.  
**[0:37:52-0:37:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:37:52):**  Just make sure you weigh their basket on the way out.  
**[0:37:55-0:37:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:37:55):**  And they'll pay for the rocks full price.  
**[0:37:57-0:38:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:37:57):**  That's, that's what happens.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:38:00):**  People you don't know what they want, they want the experience.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:38:03):**  And if they if it's for them, they picked up a nice rock.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:38:07):**  They don't mind paying for it, because that rock will be put somewhere, it will remind  
**[0:38:11-0:38:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:38:11):**  them for years, hey, we went to that place.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:38:13):**  And oh, it was amazing.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:38:15):**  We had a great day.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:38:17):**  So don't deny or, you know, don't deny people the opportunity to reconnect with their food,  
**[0:38:23-0:38:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:38:23):**  because there is, you can't hear it, I hear it, because I talked to the people and there  
**[0:38:28-0:38:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:38:28):**  is a there is such a tremendous disconnect.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:38:32):**  People don't know, all they're used to is what's on the shelves that that is not reality.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:38:38):**  You know reality because you're farming, and you need to let people in on your reality,  
**[0:38:44-0:38:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:38:44):**  and they'll pay you for that privilege, because it is a privilege to them to be able to reconnect.  
**[0:38:49-0:38:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:38:49):**  And once you get one or two people, then they'll bring family members, they'll bring friends,  
**[0:38:55-0:38:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:38:55):**  and that's how you can grow it.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:38:57):**  Start small, even if you're selling it, or co-op, whatever people to come and pick, allowing  
**[0:39:05-0:39:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:39:05):**  them to come.  
**[0:39:07-0:39:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:39:07):**  You know, you could say, look, no dogs allowed.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:39:10):**  You could say we're only open Saturdays.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:39:12):**  You can set whatever rule you want, that's the beauty of it.  
**[0:39:15-0:39:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:39:15):**  You don't have to be open to the public.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:39:17):**  You can say if you want to do this, you have to be a member first.  
**[0:39:21-0:39:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:39:21):**  It may take an adjustment because people aren't used to it, but once people start, it's like  
**[0:39:26-0:39:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:39:26):**  a wheel, and then it just gets easier and easier.  
**[0:39:30-0:39:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:39:30):**  Really cool insights there.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:39:31):**  And you touched on something really important that I know Alfonso, you are not a stranger  
**[0:39:35-0:39:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:39:35):**  to, and that's media attention.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:39:37):**  And I've seen some of your documentaries through Patagonia and some of the articles and videos  
**[0:39:43-0:39:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:39:43):**  that have come out for the amazing efforts happening there, but you also are really advancing  
**[0:39:48-0:39:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:39:48):**  on the educational side.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:39:50):**  I remember first getting in touch with you through ecosystem restoration camps and the  
**[0:39:54-0:39:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:39:54):**  incredible work that's happening as kind of the R&D department of your Finca down there,  
**[0:39:59-0:40:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:39:59):**  and La Junquera evolving into an academy as well.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:40:04):**  Can you talk about some of these real value-based PR sort of attention mechanisms that actually  
**[0:40:13-0:40:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:40:13):**  teach people about what you do rather than just showing the pretty Instagram photos of  
**[0:40:17-0:40:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:40:17):**  it?  
**[0:40:18-0:40:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:40:18):**  Yeah, indeed.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:40:19):**  So the farm, it started us, or when I started, it was in my family for a long time, but it  
**[0:40:28-0:40:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:40:28):**  was mainly farming and growing a few crops by then.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:40:34):**  Once it started, it started to be diversified into more crops and also into more innovative  
**[0:40:41-0:40:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:40:41):**  techniques or different techniques and more experiments, then it attracted indeed more  
**[0:40:46-0:40:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:40:46):**  attention for more people also who wanted to establish other projects.  
**[0:40:52-0:40:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:40:52):**  So in a way, it is still a farm where we produce a lot of different products, but it is also  
**[0:40:59-0:41:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:40:59):**  a space for projects to develop.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:41:02):**  So some of them indeed one is the first one that started was the ecosystem restoration  
**[0:41:08-0:41:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:41:08):**  camp where it is one plot within the farm where they do a lot of experiments, especially  
**[0:41:14-0:41:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:41:14):**  the riskiest ones that a lot of farmers don't want to do because they think it's too risky  
**[0:41:20-0:41:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:41:20):**  or they don't dare to do it.  
**[0:41:22-0:41:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:41:22):**  And then at that plot that can be done and also stay there for a couple of years.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:41:27):**  And then you see the example of these technicians in all the area.  
**[0:41:33-0:41:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:41:33):**  They need notation during other months.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:41:37):**  The other main project is the academy and indeed that is an academy where students come  
**[0:41:44-0:41:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:41:44):**  mainly to develop their research, their master thesis or some internships about some topics  
**[0:41:50-0:41:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:41:50):**  that we want to know more about.  
**[0:41:53-0:42:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:41:53):**  Indeed, how does the swales work with trees or with grains or intercropping this and that  
**[0:42:01-0:42:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:42:01):**  or yeah, doing these lines of vegetation here or how is the biodiversity on these hedges  
**[0:42:07-0:42:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:42:07):**  that have this type of plants or these other hedges that we planted with these other type  
**[0:42:13-0:42:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:42:13):**  of plants or how does the biodiversity in the ponds affect the rest of the farm or like  
**[0:42:21-0:42:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:42:21):**  a part we saw, for example, how all those insects in the ponds help pollinate all these  
**[0:42:26-0:42:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:42:26):**  almond trees and increase the productivity that and things that we yeah, some of them  
**[0:42:31-0:42:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:42:31):**  we are very surprised, some of them that we thought they were not that important than  
**[0:42:35-0:42:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:42:35):**  they are and the other way around.  
**[0:42:37-0:42:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:42:37):**  So research is really, really interesting and it's they're independent entities and  
**[0:42:42-0:42:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:42:42):**  independent projects, but they collaborate a lot with each other.  
**[0:42:44-0:42:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:42:44):**  We are all helping each other and lately there's more projects coming in.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:42:49):**  One is a winery that Julia, that is a winemaker that makes natural wines and established in  
**[0:42:55-0:43:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:42:55):**  the farm a year ago and then other people that they do more social media in projects  
**[0:43:04-0:43:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:43:04):**  related with ecosystem.  
**[0:43:06-0:43:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:43:06):**  So it is starting to be indeed a space more projects all related with ecosystem restoration  
**[0:43:15-0:43:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:43:15):**  or regenerative agriculture, but not necessarily all managed neither by me or not owned by  
**[0:43:22-0:43:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:43:22):**  me or by the farmer or my family, but by different people.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:43:25):**  So I think that is very helpful for all of them.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:43:29):**  They they feed each other and they help each other.  
**[0:43:34-0:43:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:43:34):**  So that is also indeed attracting a lot of attention because yeah, each one of us has  
**[0:43:39-0:43:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:43:39):**  a different network of people.  
**[0:43:41-0:43:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:43:41):**  And that also we host open days that we try to explain what's going on that sometimes  
**[0:43:47-0:43:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:43:47):**  we first have to have a meeting to explain ourselves what's going on so we can explain  
**[0:43:52-0:43:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:43:52):**  to other people because it's changing quite fast lately.  
**[0:43:56-0:44:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:43:56):**  And then in those open days, we are able to sell also directly to the people who come  
**[0:44:01-0:44:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:44:01):**  to us and we have a more amount of products, but we have also similar problem of Stefan  
**[0:44:07-0:44:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:44:07):**  that we are the closest city we have is Murcia and it's almost an hour and a half away.  
**[0:44:12-0:44:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:44:12):**  And I think people here are not so used to drive that long distances.  
**[0:44:17-0:44:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:44:17):**  But I think after hearing Stefan, we were not able to make them work of directly to  
**[0:44:25-0:44:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:44:25):**  also not just these products that we can store, but also products we cannot store easily like  
**[0:44:30-0:44:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:44:30):**  vegetables and fruits because we also grow them.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:44:34):**  But most of them, we eat them ourselves, the people we live in farm or we make them into  
**[0:44:38-0:44:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:44:38):**  a concert bus like we preserves in cans to eat the rest of the year.  
**[0:44:44-0:44:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:44:44):**  But also, we are going to start next week with meat with the first beef we're going  
**[0:44:50-0:44:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:44:50):**  to start selling.  
**[0:44:51-0:44:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:44:51):**  And that's also directly to the families who want to buy it.  
**[0:44:57-0:45:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:44:57):**  Many of the people who are in the waiting list to buy also came before to the farm to  
**[0:45:00-0:45:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:45:00):**  visit it and to see how the animals grow and how the crops go.  
**[0:45:05-0:45:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:45:05):**  So yeah, it's yeah, the social media helps a lot in our our problem so far is a bit that  
**[0:45:14-0:45:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:45:14):**  we we don't grow as fast as the attention grows, let's say.  
**[0:45:20-0:45:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:45:20):**  So we don't have enough products or the trees don't grow fast enough to match the demand  
**[0:45:28-0:45:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:45:28):**  of these things.  
**[0:45:29-0:45:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:45:29):**  Look, Alfonso, before we go into the question and answer portion, I'm curious what advice  
**[0:45:36-0:45:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:45:36):**  you would give to people who are considering getting into a cooperative model or joining  
**[0:45:41-0:45:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:45:41):**  an existing one?  
**[0:45:42-0:45:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:45:42):**  What are the some some of the main learning experiences that you've gotten from from helping  
**[0:45:46-0:45:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:45:46):**  to run the Alvalad organization?  
**[0:45:51-0:45:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:45:51):**  Well I think in our case, it started a small group of people, a small group, I think it  
**[0:45:57-0:46:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:45:57):**  was maybe 40 people or 30 people.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:46:03):**  We didn't know all of us.  
**[0:46:05-0:46:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:46:05):**  In my case, I almost didn't know anyone when I met them six years ago.  
**[0:46:09-0:46:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:46:09):**  Other people did know each other.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:46:10):**  And I think from that group, then it is very important to grow in the organically and not  
**[0:46:15-0:46:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:46:15):**  to go like very big numbers very fast, because then you need to trust those people that you  
**[0:46:24-0:46:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:46:24):**  are working with.  
**[0:46:25-0:46:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:46:25):**  And I think in this place, or I guess in many other places in the world as well, you don't  
**[0:46:32-0:46:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:46:32):**  gain that trust that fast.  
**[0:46:34-0:46:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:46:34):**  For example, for selling or for creating this cooperative to sell together.  
**[0:46:38-0:46:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:46:38):**  We were quite surprised at the beginning, like, but these people do want to do research  
**[0:46:43-0:46:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:46:43):**  practices, regenerative agriculture, they're already kind of doing it.  
**[0:46:47-0:46:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:46:47):**  They do want to get a better price, but they don't dare to sell through a new system.  
**[0:46:53-0:46:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:46:53):**  And a friend said, yeah, because they're used to being like scammed for 2000 years, or people  
**[0:46:59-0:47:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:46:59):**  to rob them or to cheat them.  
**[0:47:01-0:47:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:47:01):**  So you don't, you don't change to a new supplier or client that fast, even if it sounds very  
**[0:47:07-0:47:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:47:07):**  beautiful, or even if it has a record of two years, two years is nothing compared with  
**[0:47:12-0:47:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:47:12):**  2000 years of being cheated.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:47:15):**  That's very deep in the brain.  
**[0:47:17-0:47:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:47:17):**  So yeah, I did not get frustrated of growing maybe slower than what you would like, but  
**[0:47:22-0:47:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:47:22):**  if that growth, I think is also a lot more stable.  
**[0:47:26-0:47:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:47:26):**  And in Albelal, for example, that is the cooperative where all the a lot of projects that people  
**[0:47:32-0:47:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:47:32):**  are, we are around 300 members or 300 something I didn't check lately, but we grow maybe 10  
**[0:47:41-0:47:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:47:41):**  or 15 people a month.  
**[0:47:43-0:47:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:47:43):**  I think that's a good amount.  
**[0:47:44-0:47:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:47:44):**  It would be maybe a bit scary to grow 100 people in one month.  
**[0:47:49-0:47:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:47:49):**  And but yeah, indeed, go, go, go slowly, but not stopping.  
**[0:47:58-0:48:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:47:58):**  So and yeah, go a bit below and not be too worried about if your projections and imaginations  
**[0:48:06-0:48:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:48:06):**  of how it would be in a year is totally different, because sometimes it also happened that I  
**[0:48:13-0:48:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:48:13):**  thought, yeah, we will grow in this or that 20% next year and another 20% next year.  
**[0:48:18-0:48:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:48:18):**  And maybe you don't grow in two years and then another year you do grow what you didn't  
**[0:48:23-0:48:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:48:23):**  before.  
**[0:48:25-0:48:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:48:25):**  And also, that's very typical farming that you plan a lot of things of what you're going  
**[0:48:30-0:48:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:48:30):**  to do with the profits of the crop this year.  
**[0:48:33-0:48:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:48:33):**  And then you're going to do this and that's going to do that.  
**[0:48:36-0:48:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:48:36):**  And then you have a late frost and you don't have a crop.  
**[0:48:40-0:48:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:48:40):**  Oh, shit.  
**[0:48:41-0:48:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:48:41):**  And then you have to plan everything again.  
**[0:48:44-0:48:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:48:44):**  So yeah, adapt, be very flexible.  
**[0:48:49-0:48:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:48:49):**  I think that's, that's an advice I would give.  
**[0:48:53-0:48:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:48:53):**  Be very flexible.  
**[0:48:54-0:48:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:48:54):**  Yeah, that's solid advice for sure.  
**[0:48:57-0:49:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:48:57):**  And I'm sure everybody here who's had any experience farming can relate to those experiences  
**[0:49:01-0:49:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:49:01):**  as well.  
**[0:49:02-0:49:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:49:02):**  Now, Stefan, you've really outlined a very innovative model for a lot of people here  
**[0:49:06-0:49:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:49:06):**  in Europe.  
**[0:49:08-0:49:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:49:08):**  Can you talk about some of the expectations and advice you would give to people trying  
**[0:49:11-0:49:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:49:11):**  this out for the first time to give them sort of a realistic idea of what to expect?  
**[0:49:18-0:49:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:49:18):**  I really would say, you know, it comes down, you just start just try it, because you don't  
**[0:49:25-0:49:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:49:25):**  know how it will work out.  
**[0:49:29-0:49:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:49:29):**  I like Alfonso's take where basically, you know, they don't have enough supply for the  
**[0:49:34-0:49:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:49:34):**  demand.  
**[0:49:35-0:49:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:49:35):**  From what I've seen in Europe, as soon as word gets out, you will have a problem of  
**[0:49:41-0:49:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:49:41):**  supply.  
**[0:49:42-0:49:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:49:42):**  You think, oh, no, can't grow that fast.  
**[0:49:45-0:49:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:49:45):**  There's so many people in Europe, even like you say, you're not in an area that close.  
**[0:49:51-0:49:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:49:51):**  But there's still the little towns and there's kind of two audience, but actually there's  
**[0:49:58-0:50:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:49:58):**  all audiences, but two in particular, you get older people who come because, oh, this  
**[0:50:06-0:50:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:50:06):**  reminds me so much of when I was little because, you know, this is kind of the quality, this  
**[0:50:11-0:50:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:50:11):**  is how food was grown back then.  
**[0:50:13-0:50:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:50:13):**  And it tastes like what they remember it.  
**[0:50:16-0:50:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:50:16):**  Because for a lot of people, the taste of food has gone totally to terrible, like the  
**[0:50:23-0:50:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:50:23):**  taste is not there anymore from what they remember.  
**[0:50:27-0:50:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:50:27):**  The other one are young people who just they've never experienced it.  
**[0:50:31-0:50:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:50:31):**  So for them to reconnect, especially in the social media age, I see how many people are  
**[0:50:36-0:50:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:50:36):**  coming to the farm and look, you know, and they want to Instagram the moment.  
**[0:50:41-0:50:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:50:41):**  And that's great, too.  
**[0:50:42-0:50:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:50:42):**  I mean, any any media is is is fantastic.  
**[0:50:48-0:50:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:50:48):**  How to start?  
**[0:50:50-0:50:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:50:50):**  Imagine the worst case scenario.  
**[0:50:53-0:50:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:50:53):**  You know, what could be the worst case?  
**[0:50:55-0:51:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:50:55):**  Oh, we get people come in and maybe if you have animals, they don't know they leave the  
**[0:51:00-0:51:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:51:00):**  gates open and your animals run away.  
**[0:51:03-0:51:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:51:03):**  Maybe if you have trees, people are going to climb.  
**[0:51:07-0:51:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:51:07):**  And it's not saying it will happen.  
**[0:51:10-0:51:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:51:10):**  But if it does, at least mentally you're prepared for it.  
**[0:51:13-0:51:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:51:13):**  I mean, I often say, you know, if you can imagine the worst possible year and double  
**[0:51:19-0:51:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:51:19):**  it, and then really whatever happens, you know what, if you're okay with that, then  
**[0:51:24-0:51:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:51:24):**  it doesn't matter.  
**[0:51:26-0:51:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:51:26):**  You're not going to lose your joy because, hey, you know, the fire went through and burnt  
**[0:51:30-0:51:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:51:30):**  down half my trees or my farm.  
**[0:51:34-0:51:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:51:34):**  You know, if you have gone through that mentally, that exercise of of being ready for worst  
**[0:51:41-0:51:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:51:41):**  case scenario, then everything else is better.  
**[0:51:45-0:51:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:51:45):**  You know, you think, well, you know, they might break branches.  
**[0:51:48-0:51:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:51:48):**  Somebody had a comment in the chat, you know, damage.  
**[0:51:52-0:51:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:51:52):**  That is the big difference between members and the public.  
**[0:51:56-0:52:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:51:56):**  If you deal with people who have been in communication, maybe through email or however you've communicated  
**[0:52:03-0:52:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:52:03):**  with them, they're not showing up at the gate.  
**[0:52:05-0:52:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:52:05):**  And it's the first time because they happen to be driving by.  
**[0:52:08-0:52:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:52:08):**  These are two different groups.  
**[0:52:10-0:52:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:52:10):**  I can take time because I limited to 100 families max on a big year.  
**[0:52:16-0:52:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:52:16):**  I can take time with new people and explain them how to pick.  
**[0:52:21-0:52:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:52:21):**  It takes me two minutes or I can even do a video on how to pick.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:52:26):**  And then I put a link in the email and I'll say, here's how we pick this crop.  
**[0:52:32-0:52:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:52:32):**  So people know what to expect when they get there.  
**[0:52:35-0:52:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:52:35):**  And then I can refresh them.  
**[0:52:37-0:52:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:52:37):**  Or what I also do is if I see somebody who's been here for a few years and I see, oh, I  
**[0:52:43-0:52:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:52:43):**  see that that experienced member is coming and here's somebody new with me.  
**[0:52:47-0:52:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:52:47):**  I'll ask them, I'll say, can you just hold on a minute?  
**[0:52:49-0:52:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:52:49):**  I see somebody coming who can take you under their wing and help you.  
**[0:52:54-0:52:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:52:54):**  You gain two things.  
**[0:52:56-0:52:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:52:56):**  The member who's experienced feels valued.  
**[0:52:58-0:53:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:52:58):**  They feel like you respect their experience.  
**[0:53:02-0:53:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:53:02):**  And then you people get somebody to ask all the questions that they would ask me and they  
**[0:53:07-0:53:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:53:07):**  get it not from me.  
**[0:53:09-0:53:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:53:09):**  They get it from somebody who they it's like a review.  
**[0:53:12-0:53:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:53:12):**  So they'll go through and they say, yeah, I'm new.  
**[0:53:14-0:53:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:53:14):**  What is it like here?  
**[0:53:15-0:53:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:53:15):**  What do you honestly, you got to come earlier in the year when there's this, or you got  
**[0:53:19-0:53:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:53:19):**  to come?  
**[0:53:20-0:53:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:53:20):**  Well, that's a testimonial.  
**[0:53:23-0:53:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:53:23):**  And those people get way better than if I'm doing a sales pitch to them way better.  
**[0:53:29-0:53:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:53:29):**  So for people want to start, I'll say, listen, get a little list together and just try it.  
**[0:53:37-0:53:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:53:37):**  You don't have to sell your whole crop, just get a few people and you will know, is that  
**[0:53:43-0:53:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:53:43):**  something for you?  
**[0:53:44-0:53:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:53:44):**  Because it is not for everyone.  
**[0:53:46-0:53:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:53:46):**  Let me make that clear.  
**[0:53:48-0:53:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:53:48):**  If you're a farmer who wants to grow and send your stuff off, but you don't want to deal  
**[0:53:54-0:53:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:53:54):**  with people.  
**[0:53:55-0:53:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:53:55):**  It is not for you.  
**[0:53:56-0:53:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:53:56):**  I guarantee you it's not for you.  
**[0:53:58-0:54:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:53:58):**  You're going to be frustrated.  
**[0:54:00-0:54:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:54:00):**  You don't, you're not a people person.  
**[0:54:03-0:54:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:54:03):**  If you're not a person, then chances are you're very different.  
**[0:54:08-0:54:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:54:08):**  And one of you really likes dealing with public.  
**[0:54:11-0:54:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:54:11):**  And that's the person who you have dealing with the public and you can focus on growing  
**[0:54:16-0:54:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:54:16):**  or you can focus on whatever else, but you're not the one when it's open, you're not the  
**[0:54:21-0:54:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:54:21):**  one dealing with the public.  
**[0:54:24-0:54:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:54:24):**  And I mean, however it works out, usually there's somebody or if really, you know, your  
**[0:54:29-0:54:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:54:29):**  spouse doesn't, maybe you can hire somebody for the open days who just, they just don't  
**[0:54:34-0:54:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:54:34):**  stop talking.  
**[0:54:35-0:54:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:54:35):**  That's the kind of person you want.  
**[0:54:37-0:54:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:54:37):**  Everybody knows somebody who doesn't stop talking.  
**[0:54:40-0:54:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:54:40):**  Those are all great ideas.  
**[0:54:44-0:54:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:54:44):**  Just start.  
**[0:54:46-0:54:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:54:46):**  Well look, that's perfect timing to get us started with our Q and a session.  
**[0:54:50-0:54:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:54:50):**  And there's quite a lively chat going on in the side here.  
**[0:54:53-0:54:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:54:53):**  So whoever would like to ask their own question, I'll give you the opportunity now to raise  
**[0:54:58-0:54:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:54:58):**  your hand digitally.  
**[0:54:59-0:55:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:54:59):**  So I can call on you.  
**[0:55:00-0:55:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:55:00):**  If you don't know how to do that there at the bottom bar is a little smiley face with  
**[0:55:04-0:55:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:55:04):**  a plus sign on it.  
**[0:55:05-0:55:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:55:05):**  And it says reactions and you can just raise your hand that way and give, give your question  
**[0:55:10-0:55:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:55:10):**  directly to whoever you want.  
**[0:55:12-0:55:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:55:12):**  So go ahead and step up.  
**[0:55:14-0:55:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:55:14):**  All right, I'll leave things there since the listener questions go on for about another  
**[0:55:19-0:55:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:55:19):**  half of an hour.  
**[0:55:20-0:55:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:55:20):**  But if you want to hear the rest of the questions and the insightful answers from Alfonso and  
**[0:55:24-0:55:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:55:24):**  Stefan, just check out the subscription options on the regenerative skills, Patreon page.  
**[0:55:29-0:55:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:55:29):**  Now as great as it is to include multiple experience perspectives on the topics that  
**[0:55:33-0:55:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:55:33):**  we covered in this panel, it's impossible to include the full range of opinions and  
**[0:55:37-0:55:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:55:37):**  viewpoints out there.

**[0:56:01-0:56:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:56:01):**  you more junk, I founded these channels purely for knowledge, skill and story exchange between

**[0:56:14-0:56:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:56:14):**  and services could you offer on your farm, or any business for that matter, that could  
**[0:56:18-0:56:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/innovative-marketing-and-sales-strategies-for-farms-expert-panel-10/#t=0:56:18):**  help you stand out from others in your sector?

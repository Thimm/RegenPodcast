**[0:02:26-0:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:02:26):**  Alright, we have reached the last episode in this month's focus on fixing the food  
**[0:02:31-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:02:31):**  system.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:02:32):**  In the last three weeks, we've talked about how co-op grocery stores offer real hope for  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:02:36):**  transforming the supply and distribution of food by offering an alternative to the monopoly  
**[0:02:41-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:02:41):**  of grocery giants.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:02:42):**  We've covered the power and importance of indigenous food and land management, and we've  
**[0:02:46-0:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:02:46):**  also explored the joys and realities of growing your own food on a residential scale.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:02:52):**  So to round this all off, I had the pleasure of speaking to Meredith Lay, the author of  
**[0:02:56-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:02:56):**  The Ethical Meat Handbook.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:02:58):**  Meredith has worked as a farmer, butcher, chef, teacher, non-profit executive director,  
**[0:03:03-0:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:03:03):**  consultant, and writer for the past 17 years, all in the pursuit of sustainable food.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:03:09):**  Now the meat industry, in my opinion, is the epitome of what is broken in our food system  
**[0:03:14-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:03:14):**  and is a glaring example of the disconnect between humans and healthy natural systems.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:03:19):**  And Meredith shows us how we can reconnect with animals by treating every step of the  
**[0:03:23-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:03:23):**  process from raising to slaughter, butchery, and cooking with respect and care.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:03:29):**  Now in this interview, we start by acknowledging the broken and unhealthy state of meat consumption.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:03:34):**  We also go in depth about the environmental impacts, issues surrounding animal welfare,  
**[0:03:39-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:03:39):**  and the health problems of an imbalanced diet.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:03:41):**  Meredith then explains how a healthy and reverent relationship to animals and all their products  
**[0:03:46-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:03:46):**  could look like through real examples of ecological management of livestock systems, mindful slaughter,  
**[0:03:52-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:03:52):**  home butchery methods, and preservation through curing, fermentation, and cooking.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:03:57):**  This is one of the most holistic and nuanced perspectives on every aspect of meat that  
**[0:04:00-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:04:00):**  I've come across that even treats vegan and vegetarian perspectives on the topic with  
**[0:04:05-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:04:05):**  compassion and understanding.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:04:07):**  Meredith herself was vegan before getting involved with butchery and animal care, so  
**[0:04:11-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:04:11):**  I encourage you to listen through the full episode before jumping to conclusions on the  
**[0:04:14-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:04:14):**  angle that this interview takes.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:04:16):**  I also recognize that everything about meat from animal care to diet, slaughter, and cooking  
**[0:04:21-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:04:21):**  are very contentious topics at the moment and I would love to hear from you about how  
**[0:04:25-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:04:25):**  you feel and relate to the opinions expressed in this session.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:04:29):**  So please leave respectful comments and feedback under the show notes for this episode, or  
**[0:04:33-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:04:33):**  any other episode for that matter, at AbundantEdge.com or email me directly at info at AbundantEdge.com.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:04:39):**  Now before we get started, I'll warn you that I had a little trouble with my microphone,  
**[0:04:43-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:04:43):**  so my side of the interview is kinda muffled.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:04:46):**  But luckily Meredith's side is much better, which is what really matters.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:04:50):**  So just a heads up, and now I'll turn things over to Meredith.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:04:53):**  Hey Meredith, thanks so much for joining me today.  
**[0:04:56-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:04:56):**  It's such a pleasure to talk to you.  
**[0:04:57-0:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:04:57):**  How are you doing?  
**[0:04:58-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:04:58):**  I'm good, thanks for having me.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:05:00):**  Hey, it's my pleasure.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:05:01):**  Now I am really excited to get into this topic about talking about meat, especially as a  
**[0:05:08-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:05:08):**  dietary choice, but also through all of the different ethical implications and how that  
**[0:05:13-0:05:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:05:13):**  flies in the face of a lot of what scientific research and different opinions are going  
**[0:05:18-0:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:05:18):**  on out there.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:05:19):**  So what do you say we just jump right into questions?  
**[0:05:21-0:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:05:21):**  That sounds great.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:05:22):**  Alright cool, so could you start by telling our listeners a little bit about your personal  
**[0:05:26-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:05:26):**  background and how you got to work in butchery and release cookbooks on ethical meat?  
**[0:05:33-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:05:33):**  Sure.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:05:34):**  So I like to say I'm more at home in a room of farmers than any other person.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:05:41):**  So I'm a farmer first and foremost, and that's how I got into all of this.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:05:47):**  I was actually vegan as a dietary way of being, and I was farming A to Z organic vegetables  
**[0:05:56-0:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:05:56):**  and cut flowers, and I got some chickens, mostly at my ex-husband's behest, because  
**[0:06:05-0:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:06:05):**  we were looking for their fertility benefit from their poop.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:06:09):**  And we started harvesting them when they were ready to be harvested, and so that was kind  
**[0:06:15-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:06:15):**  of when I got into slaughtering animals on farm and trying to make use of all of the  
**[0:06:23-0:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:06:23):**  parts.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:06:24):**  And by that point I had started eating meat after some traveling around the world and  
**[0:06:30-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:06:30):**  being in different communities, particularly rural communities, where I was watching whole  
**[0:06:34-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:06:34):**  cycle farms, where animals were very much a part of the farm ecosystem.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:06:40):**  And so we started harvesting our chickens, and just economically we're having so much  
**[0:06:45-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:06:45):**  more success in the small foods economy or small farm economy with meat products than  
**[0:06:52-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:06:52):**  we were with vegetable products.  
**[0:06:54-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:06:54):**  And so we started to specialize in pasture-based, honestly raised meats, beef, pork, and poultry,  
**[0:07:03-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:07:03):**  and then realized that we were paying over half of our gross profits to our processing  
**[0:07:06-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:07:06):**  facility or slaughterhouse, and so we decided to open a butcher shop.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:07:12):**  So I learned how to butcher, mostly as a business necessity, but I've always been a cook, and  
**[0:07:18-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:07:18):**  so charcuterie and curing meats and fermentation was fascinating to me, the artfulness of it  
**[0:07:24-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:07:24):**  and the thriftiness of it.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:07:26):**  And so I guess you could just say that I went down the rabbit hole at that point, and I  
**[0:07:32-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:07:32):**  had a little restaurant and a butcher shop in addition to the farm, and unfortunately  
**[0:07:37-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:07:37):**  I lost all of that due to a divorce.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:07:39):**  But when I got kind of away from being in the business, I realized that I had gained  
**[0:07:44-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:07:44):**  a lot of perspective kind of on the supply chain, like what's missing from supply chains  
**[0:07:50-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:07:50):**  to make small farms profitable and honest meat a reality.  
**[0:07:55-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:07:55):**  And so that's when I decided to write the first book.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:07:58):**  And that is a remarkable backstory, and I think that's how so many people who feel connected  
**[0:08:03-0:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:08:03):**  to raising and eating meat as a lifestyle would like to think that someone from a previous  
**[0:08:09-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:08:09):**  perspective of vegan or vegetarianism would come to that conclusion.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:08:13):**  Tell me a little bit about how that transition was for you.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:08:17):**  What were your primary motivations for a vegan lifestyle to begin with, and what made you  
**[0:08:21-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:08:21):**  comfortable working with animals closely and eventually harvesting them?  
**[0:08:26-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:08:26):**  That's a great question.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:08:27):**  I think my, I mean, I was motivated towards a vegan diet for the same reasons a lot of  
**[0:08:33-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:08:33):**  people are.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:08:34):**  I mean, I was really aggravated at the political scene in the food industry, and I had a lot  
**[0:08:43-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:08:43):**  of empathy for the animals.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:08:44):**  I mean, the industrial, the way by which most of meat comes onto people's plates is really  
**[0:08:50-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:08:50):**  awful.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:08:51):**  I mean, in terms of animal welfare and in terms of environmental justice and social  
**[0:08:57-0:09:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:08:57):**  issues, worker safety, I mean, the list goes on and on.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:09:02):**  And it seemed like the most active thing that I could do was check out of that system.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:09:09):**  And that's something that the environmental movement from its earliest inception, I mean,  
**[0:09:13-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:09:13):**  I think I was always an environmentalist as a child, always loving animals, always loving  
**[0:09:19-0:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:09:19):**  nature.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:09:22):**  And so the earliest stages of the environmental movement really pushed up against meat production,  
**[0:09:28-0:09:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:09:28):**  meat consumption, like going all the way back to diet for a small planet and stuff like  
**[0:09:33-0:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:09:33):**  that.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:09:34):**  So it's a really obvious and easy choice for somebody who wants to make personal strides  
**[0:09:39-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:09:39):**  towards having a lower impact.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:09:43):**  But I think when I traveled around the world, I went to the third world and saw kind of  
**[0:09:49-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:09:49):**  how people dealt with land and farming from an ecosystem perspective and really realized  
**[0:09:56-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:09:56):**  that the animal had a role there and also that the choice towards veganism as a choice  
**[0:10:00-0:10:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:10:00):**  is really a privilege choice.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:10:03):**  And so that kind of challenged me in a lot of ways, because I am passionate from a social  
**[0:10:08-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:10:08):**  justice standpoint of how to make food equitable and just.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:10:11):**  And I realized that veganism really was not digging as deep as I would like to go in terms  
**[0:10:20-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:10:20):**  of trying to fix problems.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:10:23):**  And so that's when I started just sort of a more mindful inquiry, I would say, into  
**[0:10:27-0:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:10:27):**  what is up with meat and what's going on with animals in the farm system.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:10:31):**  And so, I mean, I guess I'll leave it there for now.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:10:35):**  But that just started, shall we say, opened a really big can of worms towards the work  
**[0:10:41-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:10:41):**  that I'm doing now.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:10:42):**  And I have a lot of thoughts, have a lot of thoughts about all the angles of it at this  
**[0:10:48-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:10:48):**  point.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:10:49):**  It turned out to be much more complex as anything is than I thought it would be.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:10:53):**  I mean, that's what I personally have been finding in my own life, because I've worked  
**[0:10:57-0:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:10:57):**  very close with animals.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:10:58):**  I've helped to harvest them.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:11:00):**  And I also consider myself very passionate about ecosystem conservation, ethical eating,  
**[0:11:07-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:11:07):**  and certainly the treatment and the welfare of animals.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:11:09):**  And I'm glad that you mentioned so many of the different ways that you can approach this  
**[0:11:12-0:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:11:12):**  topic, but also how you can sort of criticize it.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:11:16):**  And I mean, meat eating has come under fire from so many sides.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:11:19):**  Like you mentioned, people point to the environmental impacts of the industry, animal rights, and  
**[0:11:24-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:11:24):**  even the impact of a diet heavy in animal products in general.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:11:28):**  In your opinion, does meat still have a prominent place in a modern diet?  
**[0:11:33-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:11:33):**  Well, I guess the word that I would scratch my head over is prominent.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:11:41):**  I mean, I do think that there's a lot of evidence and certainly rancher experience towards regenerative  
**[0:11:46-0:11:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:11:46):**  models of high density grazing that are showing, yes, we can raise a large volume of animals,  
**[0:11:51-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:11:51):**  particularly ungulates, on the ground and support a diet that's pretty high in protein.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:12:00):**  But at the same time, we are still struggling to see some of our alternative systems.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:12:05):**  And when I say alternative, I want to be really conscious that a lot of these are based on  
**[0:12:09-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:12:09):**  indigenous practices.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:12:11):**  A lot of the white people who are out there talking about this right now did not invent  
**[0:12:14-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:12:14):**  this stuff.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:12:15):**  Of course.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:12:16):**  So I just want to put that out there because I'm a white person, I identify as white, and  
**[0:12:21-0:12:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:12:21):**  I want to make sure to do that justice.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:12:24):**  But I think that there is still a lot of pushback from the normal science community about some  
**[0:12:34-0:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:12:34):**  of those claims.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:12:36):**  And also, the supply chain is struggling to scale.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:12:40):**  So even if we can...  
**[0:12:41-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:12:41):**  So pretend we can bring bison back to the Great Plains and we can raise them in such  
**[0:12:46-0:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:12:46):**  numbers that to support the typical American diet of very high protein, do we have slaughter  
**[0:12:53-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:12:53):**  facilities that can mindfully harvest all of this bison?  
**[0:12:56-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:12:56):**  Do we have distribution facilities?  
**[0:12:58-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:12:58):**  Do we even have the palate in the American public for that type of meat?  
**[0:13:02-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:13:02):**  So there's lots of questions on the whole supply chain level about how to make that  
**[0:13:06-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:13:06):**  work.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:13:07):**  And I think that the most present way for us to approach this is the eat better meat,  
**[0:13:12-0:13:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:13:12):**  eat less meat type of situation.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:13:16):**  Unless you are a person experiencing enough privilege to be super close to sources for  
**[0:13:21-0:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:13:21):**  honestly raised and ethically slaughtered meat products.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:13:26):**  You know?  
**[0:13:27-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:13:27):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:13:28):**  I mean, I completely agree with that.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:13:30):**  It's been a difficult angle to approach because it's so contextual.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:13:35):**  It has so much to do with where you live, what you have access to, and whether or not  
**[0:13:39-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:13:39):**  you can find sources that meet that criteria that you are mentioning.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:13:44):**  Have you come to any personal conclusions?  
**[0:13:45-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:13:45):**  Obviously, where you live and what you have access to is going to be different than others.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:13:49):**  But certainly, can meat eating be justified at the scale that we're currently doing it?  
**[0:13:54-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:13:54):**  No, I don't think so.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:13:56):**  I mean, I don't think that we can say that we can eat meat at the scale that we currently  
**[0:14:00-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:14:00):**  do and be sure that it's all being produced and processed with the greatest amount of  
**[0:14:09-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:14:09):**  integrity.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:14:10):**  Not at all.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:14:12):**  And I think that's a perspective that a lot of people wouldn't expect from someone who's  
**[0:14:17-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:14:17):**  written extensively on this topic and has worked so closely with it.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:14:21):**  Do you feel like that's starting to change within the meat eating community to sort of  
**[0:14:25-0:14:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:14:25):**  find a middle ground between perhaps some more extreme exclusionary diets?  
**[0:14:30-0:14:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:14:30):**  Yeah, I think so.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:14:31):**  I mean, I know that there's a lot of emphasis right now on keto diets and really high protein  
**[0:14:37-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:14:37):**  diets.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:14:38):**  And so, with all of that aside, like folks that are not on specialty diets like that,  
**[0:14:44-0:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:14:44):**  I find they have a lot of appreciation for and they see the logic behind like, what about  
**[0:14:50-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:14:50):**  smaller portion sizes, guys?  
**[0:14:51-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:14:51):**  What about diversifying the types of protein that you eat?  
**[0:14:58-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:14:58):**  And also making the case for charcuterie where you experience protein in a completely different  
**[0:15:03-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:15:03):**  way and bite size, really complex sort of palate experiences.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:15:09):**  It really appeals to people and they understand, particularly chefs who are huge change makers  
**[0:15:14-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:15:14):**  right now, are definitely, I think, definitely changing the way protein presents on their  
**[0:15:20-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:15:20):**  menu and using a lot of offal and smaller portions and letting vegetables shine.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:15:27):**  But I think also making a claim that we should eat less meat or that meat is really harmful  
**[0:15:32-0:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:15:32):**  is like, it's a way of really pigeonholing our problems and saying that of all the ways  
**[0:15:37-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:15:37):**  we do agriculture, meat's the bad thing.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:15:40):**  But I think you and I both know that the way we produce vegetables on a large scale is  
**[0:15:44-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:15:44):**  really horrifying too.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:15:47):**  And so, yeah, I mean, we're here to talk about meat, so we'll keep it on that.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:15:52):**  But I did want to throw that out there.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:15:54):**  It's like, if everybody decreases the amount of meat they eat, it's not like we all of  
**[0:15:57-0:16:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:15:57):**  a sudden solved the problem of massive loss of topsoil or water contamination.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:16:02):**  Yes, exactly.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:16:03):**  There is a much more systemic problem of how all of our food is produced and meat is just  
**[0:16:09-0:16:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:16:09):**  one of the easiest ones to point out because of how many steps are in the process.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:16:14):**  It's not just planting, maintenance and then harvest.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:16:18):**  There's an actual lifestyle that we can anthropomorphize to a certain degree.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:16:21):**  I mean, that leads me to the aspect that many people are frankly most uncomfortable about.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:16:27):**  How do you view the slaughter process and answer people who argue that killing animals  
**[0:16:32-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:16:32):**  is unethical?  
**[0:16:33-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:16:33):**  Yeah, that's a big one.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:16:35):**  That's perhaps the biggest one.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:16:36):**  I mean, I think that people who feel that slaughtering animals at all is unethical,  
**[0:16:43-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:16:43):**  I'm not sure that there's a lot of conversation there.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:16:46):**  I have not experienced that there's a lot of give and take within that conversation.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:16:50):**  It's just like, it's pretty much a stone wall from my experience.  
**[0:16:55-0:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:16:55):**  But my coming to with this has been based on being a witness and seeing the most mindful  
**[0:17:10-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:17:10):**  way, shall we say, that we can harvest animals to stun it first, so to render completely  
**[0:17:17-0:17:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:17:17):**  insensible the pain and then actually make the killing cut or stab or whatever it's going  
**[0:17:23-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:17:23):**  to be.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:17:25):**  My experience with that is that it is surprisingly peaceful.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:17:31):**  It's not associated with the violence that a lot of people think death inherently holds.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:17:39):**  Being a witness to that and also being a witness to humans who are dying, I've noticed quite  
**[0:17:44-0:17:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:17:44):**  frequently that dying beings are some of the most peaceful beings among us and that it's  
**[0:17:48-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:17:48):**  the living who bring the fraught atmosphere to the dying process.  
**[0:17:56-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:17:56):**  That leads into a lot of other things about the role that death plays in our culture and  
**[0:18:01-0:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:18:01):**  the mentality that we have around it.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:18:04):**  And also the fact that a lot of people who really cringe at the thought of animal slaughter  
**[0:18:09-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:18:09):**  and animal eating are pretty removed from land and life cycle processes.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:18:16):**  So the life death life cycle of farming is really foreign to those folks and understandably  
**[0:18:24-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:18:24):**  so, as we urbanize rapidly.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:18:28):**  But I think that I have a lot of ways that I come to the table for that kind of conversation.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:18:36):**  I've also had experience with folks in the vegan community who have experienced trauma  
**[0:18:42-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:18:42):**  in their own lives and towards their own bodies.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:18:45):**  That fuels a lot of the emotional discontent around animal slaughter.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:18:48):**  It can be really loaded.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:18:51):**  That's just a few examples.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:18:53):**  But I think that the reason I've been using the word mindful a lot is not only because  
**[0:18:58-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:18:58):**  it speaks to people right now, it's very in vogue, but also because it is about being  
**[0:19:02-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:19:02):**  really present for all the things that come up for you at a moment of death and asking  
**[0:19:08-0:19:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:19:08):**  yourself what of these things actually belong to this animal and what of these things just  
**[0:19:12-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:19:12):**  belong to me?  
**[0:19:14-0:19:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:19:14):**  That's an important question for any context of death regardless of whether it's something  
**[0:19:19-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:19:19):**  you're going to be consuming or just you have a different relationship with.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:19:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:19:23):**  I mean, even if you're experiencing the death of a loved one, even like a human animal,  
**[0:19:30-0:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:19:30):**  being in that space and understanding the fear that you're bringing and the solemnity  
**[0:19:37-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:19:37):**  that you experience when you're faced with the fact that you will also die, all of these  
**[0:19:42-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:19:42):**  things come up for people.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:19:46):**  In a moment, it's very natural to have a fight or flight response, but if you can sit in  
**[0:19:51-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:19:51):**  that and rifle through those emotions and understand what you're bringing to the situation,  
**[0:19:59-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:19:59):**  it can lead to really profound growth and experience of your humanity.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:20:04):**  I think that ethical slaughter, what have you, mindful slaughter as I prefer to call  
**[0:20:09-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:20:09):**  it today is it becomes a really great way to explore not just issues of meat eating,  
**[0:20:15-0:20:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:20:15):**  but also issues of how are we in conversation with the earth and with the land and how are  
**[0:20:21-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:20:21):**  we in conversation with ourselves and our own egos?  
**[0:20:26-0:20:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:20:26):**  The question of whether or not to eat meat is one that goes back almost as far as written  
**[0:20:30-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:20:30):**  history, but most of the cultures around the world that have had a land ethic over time  
**[0:20:38-0:20:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:20:38):**  have consumed animals and have had a spiritual as well as an ecological consciousness of  
**[0:20:45-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:20:45):**  the slaughter process.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:20:47):**  It's really only cultures from conquest and cultures that have high urban or removal from  
**[0:20:55-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:20:55):**  the land that have come apart from the death process and don't really understand it or  
**[0:20:59-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:20:59):**  have space for it.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:21:01):**  That's absolutely been my experience and observation too.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:21:04):**  Of course, it's an overgeneralization and people come to their dietary choices and their  
**[0:21:09-0:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:21:09):**  conclusions on the ethics of this topic from many, many different ways, but I agree that  
**[0:21:14-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:21:14):**  usually the largest removal from accepting of how meat fits into diets and the relationship  
**[0:21:20-0:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:21:20):**  with animals is really only prevalent in societies that are very removed from the actual process  
**[0:21:26-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:21:26):**  of all of their food.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:21:28):**  And I found this across the board, I myself dabbled with vegetarian diets, having gone  
**[0:21:33-0:21:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:21:33):**  as far as veganism, and I agree with so many of the ethics of how people arrive to these  
**[0:21:38-0:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:21:38):**  choices, but it requires a certain amount of removal from the process of ecosystems,  
**[0:21:45-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:21:45):**  of cultivation, of the life cycles, of a lot of what we interact with.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:21:49):**  And if you're only consuming it sort of as a post-secondary product, I find it difficult  
**[0:21:56-0:22:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:21:56):**  to relate to people, not just on the meat issue, but also making connections on how  
**[0:22:02-0:22:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:22:02):**  all of the rest of our food is produced and consumed as an extension.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:22:08):**  And like you mentioned all throughout history, many, many cultures, especially land-based  
**[0:22:12-0:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:22:12):**  cultures, have eaten some sort of animal protein for a proportion of their sustenance, certainly  
**[0:22:17-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:22:17):**  not in the way that we are currently eating it in the Western world and on these quantities,  
**[0:22:23-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:22:23):**  but there is a very deep history and connection that is not a disrespectful one in nearly  
**[0:22:28-0:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:22:28):**  all of these traditional cases.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:22:30):**  Right.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:22:31):**  And also just the sense that Western civilization places such an enormous emphasis on the individual,  
**[0:22:40-0:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:22:40):**  the preciousness of the individual.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:22:41):**  Of course.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:22:42):**  And that's not something that herd animals do, nor lots of other cultures.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:22:48):**  And so I think the way that I come at it, I'm not speaking about this with any sort  
**[0:22:53-0:22:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:22:53):**  of admonition towards those who gravitate towards a plant-based diet.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:22:59):**  My experience, and while many people in that community have gone out of their way to upset  
**[0:23:04-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:23:04):**  me and to target me, I've really found a lot of compassion in my journey with the vegan  
**[0:23:16-0:23:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:23:16):**  community because I can see, I can really understand all of the issues and see why that  
**[0:23:22-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:23:22):**  feels like a really tangible choice.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:23:25):**  And I can also see a lot of the trauma and emotional disruption that informs that choice  
**[0:23:31-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:23:31):**  for some of the most behemoth people within that community.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:23:37):**  And so I think, like you said, it's very personal.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:23:41):**  But my work is trying to focus on the folks who have already made the choice to eat meat.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:23:47):**  So saying because of this problem we have, we're over-consuming, like rare muscle commodity,  
**[0:23:54-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:23:54):**  the normalized system of Big Macs and whatnot is really horrific for the environment as  
**[0:24:01-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:24:01):**  well as for people and animals.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:24:03):**  And so recognizing that if those people see the textured situation before us and make  
**[0:24:11-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:24:11):**  a change, then that will have more of an impact than the people who don't eat meat doing whatever  
**[0:24:17-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:24:17):**  it is that they do.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:24:18):**  So I agree.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:24:19):**  I completely agree.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:24:20):**  And I think you and I are kind of on this scale of we probably have more in common with  
**[0:24:25-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:24:25):**  our priorities and our ethics with many people who have abandoned meat altogether than many  
**[0:24:29-0:24:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:24:29):**  people who do it without care for the process.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:24:34):**  And I agree, talking to those people who have already kind of made an extreme choice in  
**[0:24:37-0:24:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:24:37):**  the other direction are much more likely to have a real impact on the industry at large,  
**[0:24:43-0:24:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:24:43):**  which I think is one of your main motivations, no?  
**[0:24:46-0:24:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:24:46):**  Right, totally.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:24:48):**  So yeah, and then once you start looking at them, if you have the person, the butcher,  
**[0:24:52-0:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:24:52):**  the chef, the abattoir, the retail person, and you start to blow it out and look at the  
**[0:24:58-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:24:58):**  supply chains and look at systems rather than the small pieces, then you can really sort  
**[0:25:06-0:25:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:25:06):**  of see a ton of different ways to attack the issue that are very approachable to the everyday  
**[0:25:13-0:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:25:13):**  citizen.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:25:14):**  And so that's super empowering, right?  
**[0:25:16-0:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:25:16):**  Like, oh wow, I can address this without completely checking out from it and I can address it  
**[0:25:21-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:25:21):**  from several different starting points.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:25:24):**  I love that approach, yeah.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:25:25):**  Now here, let's switch gears just a second and maybe tackle the last really controversial  
**[0:25:29-0:25:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:25:29):**  aspect of meat eating in the modern day, and that's the effect on our bodies and the dietary  
**[0:25:35-0:25:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:25:35):**  repercussions of eating certainly as much meat as is prevalent in our society in the  
**[0:25:40-0:25:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:25:40):**  United States or let's say in the West in general.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:25:44):**  Where do you stand on that and how do you see it as, I would say, a dietary system and  
**[0:25:48-0:25:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:25:48):**  its impact on our health?  
**[0:25:50-0:25:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:25:50):**  That's such a big question.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:25:52):**  Well, I certainly think that the standard or mainstream sort of dietary nutrition science  
**[0:25:58-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:25:58):**  is totally wacko.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:26:01):**  I mean, what I've seen is that it tends to pretend that everybody is built the same way,  
**[0:26:07-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:26:07):**  number one, and number two is heavily corporatized and so it is going to recommend and favor  
**[0:26:13-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:26:13):**  things that might actually not be good for human health at all.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:26:19):**  What I understand about meat consumption is that it's highly contextual.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:26:24):**  Like you said, there's going to be people, I mean, I know a woman in my own life who  
**[0:26:29-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:26:29):**  has such severe chronic illness that the only way she's been able to feel better is on a  
**[0:26:34-0:26:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:26:34):**  really high protein diet and relatively raw protein.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:26:38):**  That being said, she's also, I would say she's like postmenopausal and research is showing  
**[0:26:46-0:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:26:46):**  that as a person ages, the ratio of protein in their diet should increase because of certain  
**[0:26:52-0:26:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:26:52):**  hormone pathways and the way protein is processed in the body.  
**[0:26:55-0:27:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:26:55):**  So if you want to say anything general, I think it would be that the younger a person  
**[0:27:00-0:27:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:27:00):**  is, the higher amount of carbohydrates, vial, legumes, and vegetables that they should be  
**[0:27:05-0:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:27:05):**  having in their diet as well as fats.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:27:08):**  So that kind of brings in animals as well.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:27:12):**  And then as you age, like the level of actual protein increasing.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:27:18):**  So I mean, that would be like the simplest way that I can answer your question.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:27:22):**  Sure.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:27:23):**  And it's a very complex issue, like you said, and I really like what you mentioned at first  
**[0:27:27-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:27:27):**  is the assumption that everybody's body or everybody's chemical makeup or dietary or  
**[0:27:32-0:27:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:27:32):**  even lifestyle choices are going to be conducive to a mass marketed idea of an idealized diet  
**[0:27:39-0:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:27:39):**  is completely unrealistic.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:27:41):**  And I think from what I've heard in so many different spheres and what you've repeated  
**[0:27:45-0:27:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:27:45):**  here, you really do need to take the time to figure out what works for you, your body,  
**[0:27:51-0:27:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:27:51):**  and that might even fluctuate with what you're going through on a rather short term basis.  
**[0:27:56-0:27:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:27:56):**  Totally.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:27:57):**  Yeah, and the other thing I wanted to mention is that we don't just make decisions about  
**[0:28:04-0:28:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:28:04):**  what we eat based on what is healthy for us.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:28:09):**  Like a lot of people eat what they eat because of emotional reasons, like you need comfort  
**[0:28:13-0:28:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:28:13):**  or a lot of people eat because of environmental reasons.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:28:16):**  I know that I make decisions about what I eat because of what I know, right?  
**[0:28:22-0:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:28:22):**  And I have the privilege and the comfort in order to do that.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:28:24):**  So if you were to ask me whether I would prefer to get my fat from fatty fish or from red  
**[0:28:32-0:28:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:28:32):**  meat, then I would probably say fatty fish.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:28:36):**  But I know that there are some serious issues with sustainable fishing, especially when  
**[0:28:40-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:28:40):**  I live in the mountains of North Carolina, right?  
**[0:28:43-0:28:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:28:43):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:28:44):**  And the distribution of that fatty fish in terms of availability of the fish within the  
**[0:28:48-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:28:48):**  population and the methods by which that fish is being caught.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:28:56):**  But what's available to me and what makes sense is for me to be eating grass-fed, honestly  
**[0:29:03-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:29:03):**  raised and mindfully slaughtered beef if I want some heavy saturated fat and some red  
**[0:29:11-0:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:29:11):**  meat.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:29:12):**  So it's like if I'm given the choice to eat locally raised pork that I know how it lived  
**[0:29:20-0:29:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:29:20):**  and died, but I know that it was fed GMO feed or go and buy a certified organic pork chop  
**[0:29:27-0:29:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:29:27):**  that I have no idea where it came from or how far it traveled or how the animal lived  
**[0:29:31-0:29:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:29:31):**  or died, I'm probably going to choose the local.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:29:36):**  And that's me.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:29:37):**  That's my personal decision because of what I know.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:29:41):**  But my decision is not necessarily based on what I believe is best for my health because  
**[0:29:45-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:29:45):**  I don't think that ingesting genetically modified foods isn't necessarily the best idea.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:29:52):**  Sure.  
**[0:29:53-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:29:53):**  Yeah, it's a very complex issue.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:29:55):**  And I love the nuances that you approach this from and the admission that the amount of  
**[0:30:00-0:30:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:30:00):**  knowledge or awareness that someone has and also the privilege and the resources that  
**[0:30:05-0:30:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:30:05):**  they have access to could be the deciding factor of the dietary choices that they make.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:30:11):**  And what I say often, find myself saying often when I'm in debates about this, whether it's  
**[0:30:16-0:30:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:30:16):**  going to be eat meat full stop.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:30:18):**  Well honestly, sometimes I feel like it would be totally fine if all the privileged people  
**[0:30:22-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:30:22):**  decided not to.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:30:23):**  You know what I mean?  
**[0:30:25-0:30:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:30:25):**  But there's a lot of folks who don't have that option of cherry picking what they eat  
**[0:30:30-0:30:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:30:30):**  at all.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:30:33):**  So we've got to take that into consideration for certain.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:30:37):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:30:38):**  All right.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:30:39):**  So let's talk a little bit now because we've kind of dissected all of the controversial  
**[0:30:45-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:30:45):**  aspects of the meat industry and meat in diet at this point.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:30:48):**  Let's start taking more of an approach towards aspirations and what an ethical meat based  
**[0:30:55-0:30:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:30:55):**  diet can look like.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:30:57):**  So what does ethical meat specifically mean to you and how do you go about finding it?  
**[0:31:03-0:31:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:31:03):**  Well ethical meat is summed up by a good life, a good death, a good butcher, and a good cook.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:31:09):**  And there's a lot within that, but that's the quick and dirty definition.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:31:15):**  And you would want to, the best way to go about getting it is to establish relationships.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:31:21):**  So if you have the ability to raise animals yourself, that's a great way to get it.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:31:27):**  If you can establish relationships with people who are raising it, then that's another great  
**[0:31:31-0:31:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:31:31):**  way to get it.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:31:32):**  So farmer's market, online buying clubs, cooperative groceries, and stuff like that.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:31:40):**  So right off the bat, it's very clear that ethical meat is harder and harder to access  
**[0:31:48-0:31:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:31:48):**  when you can't prioritize food choice.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:31:50):**  If you don't have the privilege to prioritize food choice.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:31:54):**  But for now, that's the easiest way to go about it.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:31:59):**  Certainly.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:32:00):**  Let's talk about your personal hierarchy then of what you look for when buying meat.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:32:05):**  Because access and different factors are going to be different for everyone.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:32:08):**  What would you prioritize first?  
**[0:32:10-0:32:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:32:10):**  What I prioritize first?  
**[0:32:12-0:32:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:32:12):**  Well I guess, I mean if I'm out at a restaurant, I will absolutely ask how the animal lived  
**[0:32:18-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:32:18):**  and died.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:32:20):**  So I think that that's, and if the person can't tell me, then I'll just avoid it.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:32:24):**  Right?  
**[0:32:25-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:32:25):**  So that would be my first, I guess my first question is, and sometimes if I have a relationship  
**[0:32:30-0:32:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:32:30):**  with the person who raised it, then I'll know how it lived and I'll know how it died.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:32:35):**  And after that, I guess it would be what it was fed.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:32:41):**  And I would probably use my sensory cues to look at it and see what I felt about it, especially  
**[0:32:48-0:32:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:32:48):**  if it was a raw piece of meat.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:32:50):**  Does it have good color?  
**[0:32:52-0:32:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:32:52):**  Does it look like there was stress in the animal?  
**[0:32:55-0:32:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:32:55):**  But again, this is all based on the knowledge that I have.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:32:58):**  And I, and in my classes and stuff, I seek to teach people like look for speckles in  
**[0:33:04-0:33:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:33:04):**  the meat, look for oxidation, look for, you know, if you're able to butcher your own meat,  
**[0:33:09-0:33:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:33:09):**  which I recommend as many people as can possibly do, try to get into it, at least on a rudimentary  
**[0:33:16-0:33:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:33:16):**  level, you can start to recognize signs of stress in the muscles and in the fat, in the  
**[0:33:22-0:33:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:33:22):**  glands of the animal.  
**[0:33:24-0:33:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:33:24):**  And so you can build an awareness of what really quality meat, really quality fat looks  
**[0:33:29-0:33:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:33:29):**  like, what the joints feel like.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:33:34):**  And then you're on your way, right?  
**[0:33:35-0:33:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:33:35):**  You can kind of sniff it out right away.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:33:38):**  Well, so if you recommend more people get involved with butchery, what would be the  
**[0:33:43-0:33:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:33:43):**  first steps and sort of a transition into processing meat yourself?  
**[0:33:47-0:33:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:33:47):**  I would say the first steps are to pick up any book that teaches you butchery.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:33:52):**  And it doesn't have to be whole animal butchery, but most of the books that do this will start  
**[0:33:56-0:33:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:33:56):**  with the whole carcass.  
**[0:33:57-0:34:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:33:57):**  But it needs to take you down to sub primal level at some point.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:34:02):**  So what I mean when I say that is when an animal is slaughtered, it's usually, you know,  
**[0:34:06-0:34:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:34:06):**  taken from its whole state into quarters or halves.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:34:10):**  And then it goes down into cuts called primals.  
**[0:34:12-0:34:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:34:12):**  And then it goes from primals to sub primals, and then from sub primals into retail cuts,  
**[0:34:17-0:34:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:34:17):**  which is what most people are used to buying at the farmers market or the grocery.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:34:21):**  And so anybody, truly anybody with a knife on a cutting board can start to dig in with  
**[0:34:27-0:34:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:34:27):**  sub primal cuts.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:34:29):**  So these are like muscle groups.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:34:31):**  And most of them will fit on a standard like 18 inch cutting board, right?  
**[0:34:35-0:34:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:34:35):**  And you can with the exception of some beef sub primals because beef is large.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:34:40):**  But you can get sub primals from a local butcher shop from a farmers market, lots of farmers  
**[0:34:45-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:34:45):**  can set it up with their avatar to get you that whole cut.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:34:49):**  And not only will you pay less price per pound on that whole thing, because the farmer won't  
**[0:34:54-0:34:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:34:54):**  have to pay the butcher to cut it down for you.  
**[0:34:57-0:35:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:34:57):**  But then you can also probably get more meals out of that one piece than you would if you  
**[0:35:03-0:35:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:35:03):**  bought each of those steaks, what have you, you know, solo.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:35:08):**  And I mean, for me, some of the benefits of working with sub primal cuts like this is  
**[0:35:13-0:35:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:35:13):**  that there's so many things that are thrown away before you get it as a retail cut, like  
**[0:35:18-0:35:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:35:18):**  you mentioned, which are super useful.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:35:20):**  And you can turn them into all kinds of other products, which extend the usefulness of what  
**[0:35:25-0:35:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:35:25):**  you bought originally, don't you think?  
**[0:35:27-0:35:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:35:27):**  Totally, yeah.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:35:28):**  I mean, I wrote, I did an article from Mother Earth News last year, and it was called beef  
**[0:35:31-0:35:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:35:31):**  sub primal butchery.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:35:32):**  And there was a, you know, there was an example in there, if you get a top sirloin sub primal,  
**[0:35:37-0:35:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:35:37):**  you can produce like three months worth of steaks, you know, I mean, I don't know how  
**[0:35:42-0:35:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:35:42):**  much meat you know, we're assuming people eat, but we're not assuming that they eat  
**[0:35:46-0:35:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:35:46):**  steaks every night.  
**[0:35:47-0:35:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:35:47):**  But you can get like a decent, you know, a suite of meals for your family for a much  
**[0:35:54-0:35:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:35:54):**  lower price per pound than if you went out and bought all the steaks, you know, one by  
**[0:35:58-0:35:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:35:58):**  one.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:35:59):**  And the process is very simple for breaking down that sub primal into into usable cuts  
**[0:36:05-0:36:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:36:05):**  for the family.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:36:06):**  And you also have options, right?  
**[0:36:07-0:36:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:36:07):**  Like, you don't have to cut it one certain way.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:36:10):**  Like you could produce roasts as opposed to steaks or larger grilling cuts as opposed  
**[0:36:14-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:36:14):**  to smaller servings.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:36:16):**  So it gives you a lot of creativity and it empowers you to make more flexible choices  
**[0:36:20-0:36:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:36:20):**  in the kitchen, you know, in addition to the bang for the buck, right?  
**[0:36:24-0:36:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:36:24):**  Oh, that's exactly one of the things that I love about this is because a lot of people  
**[0:36:28-0:36:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:36:28):**  complain that eating ethically raised meat, organic meat or locally raised meat is so  
**[0:36:34-0:36:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:36:34):**  much more expensive.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:36:35):**  And it should be because there's a much more care, there's a lot more or there are much  
**[0:36:39-0:36:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:36:39):**  higher quality feeds going into the process and people need to be paid well for this.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:36:45):**  But if you want to offset that cost and still make it affordable to an average person, you  
**[0:36:49-0:36:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:36:49):**  just have to get involved at an earlier stage of the process.  
**[0:36:53-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:36:53):**  Right, right.  
**[0:36:54-0:37:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:36:54):**  So a quick explanation of that is like, so the probably the highest cost in small scale  
**[0:37:00-0:37:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:37:00):**  meat production.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:37:01):**  So if you're already in the camp of being like, okay, I'm going to buy my meat from  
**[0:37:04-0:37:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:37:04):**  a small scale farmer, then one of the highest costs that that farmer is incurring is the  
**[0:37:09-0:37:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:37:09):**  slaughter and processing fees that they pay a third party usually to do.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:37:16):**  And you know what, there's one flat fee usually for you know, actually killing the animal.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:37:20):**  And then there is a per pound price for what we call cut and wrap processing.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:37:26):**  That's taking that animal from, you know, the hanging weight.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:37:29):**  So the weight of the animal without the blood in the organs once it's killed, down into  
**[0:37:33-0:37:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:37:33):**  all those retail cuts.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:37:34):**  So if you buy as whole as possible, then the farmer as a business person cuts out those  
**[0:37:39-0:37:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:37:39):**  cut and wrap costs and can then turn you those whole portions, turn them over to you at a  
**[0:37:45-0:37:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:37:45):**  lower cost per pound or should be able to.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:37:48):**  And that's another thing is that you might have to advocate for yourself a little bit.  
**[0:37:52-0:37:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:37:52):**  You know, if the farmer doesn't know that you're savvy, you might be buying your sub  
**[0:37:57-0:38:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:37:57):**  primals or whatever for the same price that you would be buying your rib eyes for.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:38:00):**  So you definitely need to be, you know, making sure like, hey, man, I scratch your back and  
**[0:38:06-0:38:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:38:06):**  scratch mine.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:38:07):**  You're avoiding some business costs here.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:38:09):**  Like, how about you turn over the reward of that a little bit to your customer.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:38:13):**  And you know, most people who are involved in small scale alternative agriculture movements  
**[0:38:20-0:38:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:38:20):**  are definitely into like, let's all work together to make this possible.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:38:24):**  So it's not a difficult conversation to have if it's something that you're committed to.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:38:28):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:38:29-0:38:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:38:29):**  And it seems like every part of these processes that you're advocating for at some point really  
**[0:38:34-0:38:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:38:34):**  come back to getting involved with the community around the production, the raising, the processing  
**[0:38:39-0:38:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:38:39):**  of this.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:38:40):**  And the more you get involved with that, you'll save money.  
**[0:38:44-0:38:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:38:44):**  You'll also create relationships.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:38:46):**  You'll help along with the quality control.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:38:50):**  And so many other benefits come from, it's almost a shift in lifestyle, not so much just  
**[0:38:54-0:38:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:38:54):**  a way of looking at reducing costs on meat.  
**[0:38:57-0:38:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:38:57):**  Oh, totally.  
**[0:38:58-0:39:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:38:58):**  And the other thing is, like for people who are in super urban areas, or who don't feel  
**[0:39:02-0:39:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:39:02):**  like they have like, you know, I know there's a lot of issues with like, where farmers markets  
**[0:39:06-0:39:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:39:06):**  are located and the way that they're organized in terms of being accessible to everybody.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:39:13):**  And so there's lots of ways that people can team up, you know, to make ethical meat available  
**[0:39:17-0:39:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:39:17):**  to themselves and their loved ones, like forming little buying groups and saying, Okay, well,  
**[0:39:22-0:39:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:39:22):**  I can't make use of a half of a lamb on my own, but maybe me and two of my neighbors  
**[0:39:28-0:39:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:39:28):**  can do it.  
**[0:39:30-0:39:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:39:30):**  And you know, we can decide how we want to cut, we can buy more whole or we can get it  
**[0:39:35-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:39:35):**  cut all the way down, you know, and go home each with the portions that we like, you know,  
**[0:39:41-0:39:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:39:41):**  maybe the folks in the group who want to eat the lesser use cuts get to pay a bit lower  
**[0:39:45-0:39:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:39:45):**  price than the people who just want the loin chops, you know, and the rack and the leg,  
**[0:39:51-0:39:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:39:51):**  you know, which is the stuff that's easy to cook.  
**[0:39:53-0:40:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:39:53):**  And so getting creative, you know, about how we capitalize good meat production and how  
**[0:40:00-0:40:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:40:00):**  we purchase, you know, ethically raised meats, instead of just expecting the systems to be  
**[0:40:05-0:40:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:40:05):**  in place for us to go and pick it up, is a really great way to sort of check into the  
**[0:40:10-0:40:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:40:10):**  system and also get involved when you don't feel like you have a huge amount of financial  
**[0:40:15-0:40:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:40:15):**  resources, you know, right available for this.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:40:19):**  Speaking of those financial resources, one of the things that you write passionately  
**[0:40:23-0:40:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:40:23):**  about is charcuterie and a lot of people consider different cured and preserved meats to be  
**[0:40:28-0:40:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:40:28):**  quite expensive, especially when they're high quality and, you know, used high quality ingredients.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:40:34):**  But I know from reading some of your work that this is actually a very simple process  
**[0:40:39-0:40:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:40:39):**  that just takes a little bit of education.  
**[0:40:41-0:40:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:40:41):**  Can you give us a little overview about how someone might get introduced into cured and  
**[0:40:46-0:40:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:40:46):**  processed meats?  
**[0:40:47-0:40:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:40:47):**  Oh, totally.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:40:48):**  Well, it's all over the internet.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:40:51):**  Charcuterie is very in vogue right now.  
**[0:40:53-0:40:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:40:53):**  It's very trendy.  
**[0:40:54-0:40:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:40:54):**  So there's a thousand and one or more recipes online for how you can start making your own  
**[0:40:59-0:41:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:40:59):**  bacon, how you can get...  
**[0:41:01-0:41:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:41:01):**  I would say that that's probably the most successful thing to do is like, go ahead and  
**[0:41:05-0:41:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:41:05):**  try some kind of whole muscle cured product.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:41:08):**  So we're talking about bacon or brussella or guanciale or some of the, you know, some  
**[0:41:15-0:41:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:41:15):**  lardo, some of the things that folks might have, some words folks might have heard before.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:41:21):**  But all that entails and even just making your own deli ham for like lunches for your  
**[0:41:25-0:41:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:41:25):**  kids.  
**[0:41:26-0:41:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:41:26):**  It's a very simple process of just getting salt on meat to draw down the water in it.  
**[0:41:31-0:41:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:41:31):**  And then, you know, after a prescribed amount of time, you're going on to either roasting  
**[0:41:35-0:41:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:41:35):**  that item, smoking that item, you know, baking it or if you want to get a little more advanced,  
**[0:41:41-0:41:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:41:41):**  fermenting it.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:41:43):**  And so yeah, I have a huge soapbox about charcuterie and its gourmet status.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:41:49):**  Because really, it comes from extremely industrious people all over the world who are dealing  
**[0:41:55-0:42:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:41:55):**  with extremely major circumstances and have to make the most of the animal and have to  
**[0:42:01-0:42:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:42:01):**  do it without ready refrigeration, without ready fire.  
**[0:42:05-0:42:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:42:05):**  And so this is like, I mean, if we want to get down and dirty, this is poor people's  
**[0:42:08-0:42:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:42:08):**  food.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:42:09):**  Right?  
**[0:42:10-0:42:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:42:10):**  And so having brought it up to this thing that's completely inaccessible, to me feels  
**[0:42:14-0:42:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:42:14):**  really ridiculous.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:42:16):**  So a lot of my classes are about giving that skill back to the people and opening the doors  
**[0:42:21-0:42:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:42:21):**  for them.  
**[0:42:23-0:42:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:42:23):**  Because it's actually totally doable for any home cook.  
**[0:42:28-0:42:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:42:28):**  I love that you mentioned that.  
**[0:42:29-0:42:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:42:29):**  I mean, just like you mentioned with this being sort of poor people's food, it came  
**[0:42:34-0:42:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:42:34):**  out of the needs for preserving things for a longer period of time using the minimal  
**[0:42:39-0:42:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:42:39):**  possible resources, not having access to refrigeration, all these things.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:42:43):**  And I mean, in so many cuisines that I've sampled and been a part of around the world  
**[0:42:47-0:42:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:42:47):**  in my travels, that's where the most rich, most beautiful and well sort of taking care  
**[0:42:54-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:42:54):**  of and processed food comes from is the need, the preservation process.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:43:01):**  And the appreciation.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:43:02):**  Permentation.  
**[0:43:03-0:43:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:43:03):**  Yeah.  
**[0:43:04-0:43:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:43:04):**  Exactly.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:43:05):**  And like you said, it has been put on this sort of elevated platform.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:43:08):**  But if people rediscover the origins, this is something that we can really reclaim as  
**[0:43:12-0:43:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:43:12):**  food for the people.  
**[0:43:14-0:43:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:43:14):**  That's right.  
**[0:43:15-0:43:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:43:15):**  And it's also something that there's a lot of room to play with.  
**[0:43:18-0:43:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:43:18):**  So all respect to tradition, there's some beautiful, beautiful things that people in  
**[0:43:22-0:43:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:43:22):**  the old world have done and there's no reason to change them.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:43:25):**  But at the same time, if you master the basic technique, you can really take off with a  
**[0:43:29-0:43:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:43:29):**  lot of creative flavor profiles and really make it your own.  
**[0:43:33-0:43:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:43:33):**  And a lot of chefs are waking up to this right now in terms of how they incorporate animal  
**[0:43:38-0:43:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:43:38):**  proteins and charcuterie or via charcuterie into their menus.  
**[0:43:41-0:43:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:43:41):**  It's like, wow, I can really jump off and jump off big with sausage making or with meat  
**[0:43:48-0:43:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:43:48):**  fermentation.  
**[0:43:49-0:43:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:43:49):**  And not only that, but I can really impact the way that people experience protein.  
**[0:43:54-0:43:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:43:54):**  Instead of it being this huge eight ounce portion in the center of the plate, it becomes  
**[0:43:58-0:44:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:43:58):**  this much more nuanced, much more complex sort of specialized experience.  
**[0:44:06-0:44:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:44:06):**  And I think that that could really do wonders for the problem of meat in our culture.  
**[0:44:13-0:44:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:44:13):**  I completely agree.  
**[0:44:14-0:44:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:44:14):**  Now, let's talk a little bit about integrating animals into your garden.  
**[0:44:18-0:44:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:44:18):**  I want to talk more about the aspirational aspects of integrating animals in a healthy  
**[0:44:24-0:44:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:44:24):**  way and what it could mean if we were managing, from your experience in working with animals  
**[0:44:30-0:44:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:44:30):**  directly and how they integrate in with a holistic homestead.  
**[0:44:33-0:44:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:44:33):**  Yeah, well, they integrate in beautifully.  
**[0:44:37-0:44:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:44:37):**  Specifically if somebody's already on the path of trying to be as self-reliant as possible,  
**[0:44:42-0:44:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:44:42):**  then the animal brings a lot of really awesome attributes to that.  
**[0:44:47-0:44:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:44:47):**  And particularly, especially, I mean, gardeners are mostly working on a smaller scale.  
**[0:44:50-0:44:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:44:50):**  So we're talking like poultry, chickens, geese, ducks, quail, pheasants, guineas, animals  
**[0:44:59-0:45:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:44:59):**  like this.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:45:00):**  And then also rabbits are really good animals for incorporating into the homestead or garden.  
**[0:45:06-0:45:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:45:06):**  And even though rabbit is not a food that lots of people consume, it's certainly on  
**[0:45:11-0:45:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:45:11):**  the rise.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:45:12):**  It's got twice as much protein as chicken and it's leaner.  
**[0:45:16-0:45:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:45:16):**  And so that appeals to a lot of folks.  
**[0:45:19-0:45:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:45:19):**  And then obviously the fertility benefits of the animals are huge.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:45:23):**  So you can be making compost or having the animals pooping directly onto ground that  
**[0:45:29-0:45:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:45:29):**  you want to turn over.  
**[0:45:32-0:45:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:45:32):**  And so, yeah, there's a lot of applications.  
**[0:45:34-0:45:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:45:34):**  You can go even further when you do your harvest and you can be making your own blood meal,  
**[0:45:38-0:45:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:45:38):**  you can be making your own feather meal.  
**[0:45:42-0:45:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:45:42):**  You can obviously get a lot more meals out of home raised animals because you've got  
**[0:45:50-0:45:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:45:50):**  all of it to deal with.  
**[0:45:51-0:45:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:45:51):**  So making patties, making really rich stocks in addition to eating the skeletal muscle  
**[0:45:57-0:46:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:45:57):**  that you're used to eating in terms of roasts and steaks and whatnot.  
**[0:46:01-0:46:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:46:01):**  Yeah, I love it.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:46:03):**  I mean, listeners of this podcast will remember through all of the different regenerative  
**[0:46:07-0:46:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:46:07):**  round table sessions in previous months with me talking with my former business colleagues  
**[0:46:12-0:46:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:46:12):**  on the homestead that we founded in rural Guatemala, just how much time and focus we  
**[0:46:17-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:46:17):**  put into integrating the animal systems in with the larger production methods.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:46:21):**  Now we were only on about a half an acre of land, so we were very confined with what we  
**[0:46:25-0:46:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:46:25):**  could do.  
**[0:46:26-0:46:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:46:26):**  We had to go and graze off on pastures up in the mountains, but we had chickens and  
**[0:46:31-0:46:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:46:31):**  ducks rotating through the system, not only in the pens, but also in different areas of  
**[0:46:35-0:46:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:46:35):**  the garden and the production areas as well.  
**[0:46:38-0:46:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:46:38):**  And that's something I've been very passionate about since I had more firsthand experience  
**[0:46:42-0:46:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:46:42):**  of how it works into a mixed use farm and not just focusing entirely on one of those  
**[0:46:48-0:46:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:46:48):**  enterprises and all of the different byproducts that not only add fertility to the system,  
**[0:46:54-0:46:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:46:54):**  but majorly cut down on work.  
**[0:46:56-0:47:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:46:56):**  I mean, we had it at the point where the goat pen only needed to be cleaned out about once  
**[0:47:01-0:47:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:47:01):**  every month, month and a half because of having the chickens in there oxygenating the compost,  
**[0:47:07-0:47:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:47:07):**  cleaning off the goats directly.  
**[0:47:10-0:47:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:47:10):**  They'd often just perch on their bodies, even the little ones, it was really cute.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:47:14):**  And also eating the parasites and the bugs out of the bedding below just to keep the  
**[0:47:19-0:47:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:47:19):**  whole system much, much cleaner.  
**[0:47:21-0:47:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:47:21):**  Totally, and it used to be, I mean, I don't know that you couldn't necessarily raise some  
**[0:47:27-0:47:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:47:27):**  of those larger animals on the small scale, but I mean, Korean natural farming and a lot  
**[0:47:31-0:47:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:47:31):**  of these approaches are, there's a lot of ways that you can use microbial teas and sprays  
**[0:47:38-0:47:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:47:38):**  to really manage animal pens on the small scale, particularly even pigs, like the no  
**[0:47:44-0:47:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:47:44):**  smell piggery for Korean natural farming.  
**[0:47:46-0:47:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:47:46):**  If people are interested in this, look it up.  
**[0:47:50-0:47:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:47:50):**  But it's all about working with indigenous microorganisms in order to like neutralize  
**[0:47:55-0:48:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:47:55):**  odors and speed composting of animal waste, and then really getting the animals super  
**[0:48:03-0:48:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:48:03):**  integrated into eating slugs or pest control, other pest control applications.  
**[0:48:10-0:48:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:48:10):**  Yeah, it's fascinating and it's dynamic.  
**[0:48:15-0:48:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:48:15):**  It's a living system, so there are always things to monitor, to tweak.  
**[0:48:18-0:48:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:48:18):**  That's why I said it can be very hard.  
**[0:48:20-0:48:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:48:20):**  It can, it's a lot of work.  
**[0:48:23-0:48:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:48:23):**  But it's very rewarding and I really value the relationships that we built with the animals,  
**[0:48:28-0:48:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:48:28):**  even though we knew that at a point at the end they were going to be harvested.  
**[0:48:33-0:48:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:48:33):**  That does a lot for an understanding of the life cycles of production methods like that  
**[0:48:38-0:48:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:48:38):**  and how though there is a sharp cut off of their useful life in those systems, taking  
**[0:48:44-0:48:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:48:44):**  care of every step of their life cycle in between and making sure that they're very  
**[0:48:49-0:48:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:48:49):**  well taken care of, they're healthy, they're happy, and the process really connects you  
**[0:48:53-0:48:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:48:53):**  to every aspect of how you're producing and how you're eating.  
**[0:48:58-0:49:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:48:58):**  Right, and that the animal is fulfilling a role in the ecosystem, right?  
**[0:49:03-0:49:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:49:03):**  It's not just there for us to consume it, right?  
**[0:49:05-0:49:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:49:05):**  It's there because it has a unique capability.  
**[0:49:09-0:49:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:49:09):**  Your goats can eat invasive plants.  
**[0:49:11-0:49:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:49:11):**  How amazing is that, right?  
**[0:49:13-0:49:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:49:13):**  If we continue to disturb ecosystems at the rate that we are as humans, what is the being  
**[0:49:19-0:49:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:49:19):**  that can remain in conversation with the earth?  
**[0:49:22-0:49:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:49:22):**  Well the herbivore, right?  
**[0:49:24-0:49:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:49:24):**  So how beautiful is that that these animals have a role and how wonderful it is for us  
**[0:49:28-0:49:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:49:28):**  to give them that niche, right?  
**[0:49:30-0:49:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:49:30):**  In addition to them being food for us.  
**[0:49:32-0:49:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:49:32):**  Indeed.  
**[0:49:33-0:49:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:49:33):**  Now, to kind of wrap up here, can you talk a little bit about, from your opinion, what's  
**[0:49:39-0:49:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:49:39):**  the ideal interaction between human and animals look like and how can we sort of transform  
**[0:49:44-0:49:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:49:44):**  our current meat system from an industrial and exploitative one?  
**[0:49:48-0:49:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:49:48):**  What might it look like if this were a healthier industry at large?  
**[0:49:53-0:49:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:49:53):**  Yeah, that's a difficult question to answer at the scale that it needs to be answered,  
**[0:49:58-0:50:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:49:58):**  but I would say ideally, you know, it would look like prosperous farmers, you know, who  
**[0:50:05-0:50:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:50:05):**  are able to make a living on the farm and set up the systems on their farm in a way  
**[0:50:13-0:50:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:50:13):**  that made their farm a thriving ecosystem, right?  
**[0:50:17-0:50:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:50:17):**  And if that happens, then supply chains, I believe, would develop for meat to reach the  
**[0:50:25-0:50:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:50:25):**  people in a mindful way.  
**[0:50:28-0:50:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:50:28):**  But right now it's like, we have a lot of other stuff that we have to address in order  
**[0:50:35-0:50:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:50:35):**  for that system to happen to scale.  
**[0:50:37-0:50:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:50:37):**  I think people of privilege right now can like get off of the podcast or whatever and  
**[0:50:43-0:50:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:50:43):**  go home and start doing something, whether it's buying differently, eating differently,  
**[0:50:48-0:50:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:50:48):**  cooking differently, eating different things, you know, to start making changes in the system.  
**[0:50:53-0:50:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:50:53):**  But I think certainly plugging into farmer communities and making sure that there's a  
**[0:50:58-0:51:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:50:58):**  solid framework for prosperous rural communities is certainly probably like the missing link  
**[0:51:07-0:51:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:51:07):**  in this situation.  
**[0:51:08-0:51:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:51:08):**  Yeah, and I mean, that goes to reinforce so much of what you already said.  
**[0:51:12-0:51:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:51:12):**  No matter where you're coming from, your level of privilege and whatnot, the more you can  
**[0:51:16-0:51:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:51:16):**  get involved in the process, in the life cycle, in the quality control of these, the more  
**[0:51:21-0:51:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:51:21):**  you can engage with it.  
**[0:51:23-0:51:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:51:23):**  And whatever you have access to at the moment is a step in the right direction and is something  
**[0:51:28-0:51:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:51:28):**  that can grow from there.  
**[0:51:30-0:51:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:51:30):**  Right, absolutely.  
**[0:51:31-0:51:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:51:31):**  And then I think, you know, if you're interested in going a step further, it's like, maybe  
**[0:51:36-0:51:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:51:36):**  try digging into some policy changes, right?  
**[0:51:39-0:51:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:51:39):**  Maybe try digging into some things that make good food more accessible to more people.  
**[0:51:44-0:51:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:51:44):**  Maybe try digging into some of the regulation around, you know, animal processing or K-phones.  
**[0:51:51-0:51:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:51:51):**  But that's sort of next level.  
**[0:51:53-0:51:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:51:53):**  It's a whole new can of worms, but you're absolutely right.  
**[0:51:58-0:52:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:51:58):**  So before I let you go, Meredith, could you tell us a little bit about how listeners can  
**[0:52:01-0:52:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:52:01):**  get in contact with you, learn more about the courses that you offer and educate themselves  
**[0:52:06-0:52:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:52:06):**  further on Ethical Meat?  
**[0:52:08-0:52:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:52:08):**  Sure, absolutely.  
**[0:52:10-0:52:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:52:10):**  So my website is merleifood.com.  
**[0:52:17-0:52:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:52:17):**  That's also my social media handle at merleifood.  
**[0:52:20-0:52:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:52:20):**  So I'm most often on Instagram and somewhat on Facebook.  
**[0:52:25-0:52:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:52:25):**  I'm so horrible at Twitter.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:52:26):**  So if you go there, you won't find much.  
**[0:52:30-0:52:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:52:30):**  And my books are the Ethical Meat Handbook and Pure Charcuterie.  
**[0:52:34-0:52:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:52:34):**  Two books available on my website, also available anywhere that you buy books.  
**[0:52:39-0:52:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:52:39):**  And those are great ways if people feel super invested into this to invest in the books,  
**[0:52:44-0:52:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:52:44):**  read them, you know, and you don't have to do everything but pick out a couple of things  
**[0:52:49-0:52:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:52:49):**  that you want to start, you know.  
**[0:52:52-0:52:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:52:52):**  And I'm available, you know, I am answering Instagram messages all the time.  
**[0:52:57-0:53:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:52:57):**  My phone number, my voice message is on my website.  
**[0:53:00-0:53:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:53:00):**  If people want to call and leave a message, I will definitely try to get back all about  
**[0:53:04-0:53:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:53:04):**  interface about this.  
**[0:53:07-0:53:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:53:07):**  So I'm not turning anybody away, at least not yet.  
**[0:53:11-0:53:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:53:11):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:53:12-0:53:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:53:12):**  Those are some great resources there.  
**[0:53:14-0:53:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:53:14):**  I personally have really enjoyed the books that you put out in the ones that I've been  
**[0:53:18-0:53:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:53:18):**  able to skim through and I can't wait to start implementing some of the fantastic advice.  
**[0:53:23-0:53:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:53:23):**  More than anything, though, the recipes in there are incredible.  
**[0:53:27-0:53:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:53:27):**  When is the second edition of the Ethical Meat Handbook coming out?  
**[0:53:31-0:53:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:53:31):**  I think I just got a notification from Amazon that it's dropping in February of 2020.  
**[0:53:38-0:53:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:53:38):**  So it seems like, yeah, maybe first thing next year.  
**[0:53:44-0:53:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:53:44):**  Awesome.  
**[0:53:45-0:53:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:53:45):**  Well, that's something to look forward to as well.  
**[0:53:47-0:53:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:53:47):**  So Meredith, thank you again so much for taking the time.  
**[0:53:50-0:53:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:53:50):**  I really hope that we can reconnect again and explore this topic further.  
**[0:53:54-0:53:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-meredith-leigh/#t=0:53:54):**  And just stay in touch.

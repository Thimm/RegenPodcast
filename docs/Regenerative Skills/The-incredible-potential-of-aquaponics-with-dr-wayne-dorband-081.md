**[0:02:26-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:02:26):**  Now I have many heroes in the regenerative economy and my guest today certainly ranks  
**[0:02:30-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:02:30):**  up at the top.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:02:32):**  Wayne Dorben and his online educational platform, the Eclynomics Action Team or EAT for short,  
**[0:02:38-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:02:38):**  has been putting out amazing webinar series with some of the best educators and practitioners  
**[0:02:42-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:02:42):**  out there for years now and Wayne himself is a great example of a successful serial  
**[0:02:47-0:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:02:47):**  entrepreneur of regenerative enterprises.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:02:50):**  Now above all though, I reached out to Wayne to get his expert opinion on aquaponics and  
**[0:02:55-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:02:55):**  aquaculture systems.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:02:57):**  In this interview, Wayne uses examples from his own commercial aquaponic system centered  
**[0:03:01-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:03:01):**  around a two-acre pond on his land in Colorado to explain the major components and concepts  
**[0:03:07-0:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:03:07):**  behind the success of his systems.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:03:09):**  We start by defining the differences between hydroponics and aquaponics and work through  
**[0:03:14-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:03:14):**  the essential components of the cycles within the system.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:03:17):**  We talk about nutrient cycling, troubleshooting and how to observe a tough to diagnose underwater  
**[0:03:22-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:03:22):**  system before killing all of your fish by accident.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:03:25):**  This is a really in-depth look at aquaponic systems so grab your notebook and I'll turn  
**[0:03:29-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:03:29):**  things over to Wayne.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:03:32):**  Hey Wayne, thank you so much for taking the time to be with us here today.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:03:35):**  How are you doing in Colorado I assume?  
**[0:03:37-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:03:37):**  I am in Colorado.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:03:39):**  It's great being here with you Oliver.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:03:40):**  It's a beautiful day here sitting looking out my window at one of the things we do on  
**[0:03:45-0:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:03:45):**  the ranch which is a whole bunch of people having some fun out in our ponds and working  
**[0:03:50-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:03:50):**  their new dogs.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:03:52):**  Oh fantastic.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:03:53):**  They're looking at their vans parked out.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:03:56):**  Yeah well the nice thing is you guys are in the middle of your summer and the seasons  
**[0:04:01-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:04:01):**  are quite different here.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:04:02):**  We're in the middle of our rainy season but we're fortunate enough to have a bit of nice  
**[0:04:06-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:04:06):**  weather and I've got a great view of the lake too so we're in good situations.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:04:10):**  Yeah this is our, we get a little hot in June and July and then it starts to cool off so  
**[0:04:18-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:04:18):**  I think the high today is in the mid 80s and lows are in the 50s maybe even going to start  
**[0:04:24-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:04:24):**  to get down into the 40s soon so it could be warm during the day and yet it cools off  
**[0:04:29-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:04:29):**  real nicely at night.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:04:30):**  We're starting to see fall grasses begin to grow.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:04:34):**  That's gorgeous.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:04:35):**  Yeah I remember that from the many seasons that I worked in the conservation corps and  
**[0:04:38-0:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:04:38):**  building trails in the national parks in the wilderness areas in Colorado.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:04:43):**  That was one of my favorite parts is those chilly nights that kind of are invigorating.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:04:47):**  But hey look Wayne I've got a ton of questions that I'd love to ask you because I've been  
**[0:04:50-0:04:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:04:50):**  following your educational platforms and your webinar series for quite some time.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:04:54):**  So what do you say we just jump in?  
**[0:04:56-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:04:56):**  Let's do it.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:04:57):**  All right so could you start by telling our listeners a little bit about your personal  
**[0:05:01-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:05:01):**  background.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:05:02):**  I know you've had experience in a ton of different regenerative enterprises and I you know we'll  
**[0:05:08-0:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:05:08):**  get to each one of those individually as we go.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:05:10):**  But give us an idea about how you got started.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:05:13):**  Yeah it goes way back for me.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:05:16):**  My mother says that I was you know playing with living things and particularly living  
**[0:05:24-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:05:24):**  things in water from way before I can remember.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:05:28):**  And when I do have my earliest memories they are from where I was growing up which is in  
**[0:05:34-0:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:05:34):**  the high desert north of Los Angeles in an area that was very rural.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:05:41):**  We had desert that was around us and we had farmland.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:05:45):**  This particular area became the alfalfa capital of California some people said the United  
**[0:05:54-0:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:05:54):**  States after World War II.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:05:59):**  And I was growing up there you know 10 15 years later.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:06:04):**  So I would love to be out and hanging out with the coyotes and the snakes and the cactuses  
**[0:06:12-0:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:06:12):**  and pretty rugged environment.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:06:16):**  And at that time I think my parents would have said they would have been put in child  
**[0:06:20-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:06:20):**  custody for today support for not paying attention because from five years old we just headed  
**[0:06:28-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:06:28):**  outside in the afternoons and came back in at dark and just wandered around sometimes  
**[0:06:35-0:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:06:35):**  either on foot or on our bikes.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:06:38):**  So that's where it started.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:06:41):**  My father was an aerospace engineer and a pilot and I grew up in a really cool place  
**[0:06:48-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:06:48):**  where I could be around very high energy and and and success level adults.  
**[0:06:55-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:06:55):**  So I had I had a guy named Chuck Yeager that lived down the street who encouraged me to  
**[0:07:01-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:07:01):**  you know be a cool young man.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:07:05):**  And Chuck was a good friend of my dad's and the astronaut Neil Armstrong lived right behind  
**[0:07:11-0:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:07:11):**  me and I got mentored by him a little bit and they all encouraged me to really follow  
**[0:07:17-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:07:17):**  my interest in the outdoors and in regenerative restorative things.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:07:24):**  And then lastly I'll tie it into the agriculture that agriculture that was occurring in this  
**[0:07:30-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:07:30):**  place I lived was not regenerative and not restorative and matter of fact very minimally  
**[0:07:36-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:07:36):**  sustainable and my friends whose fathers were alfalfa farmers their fathers all said guess  
**[0:07:45-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:07:45):**  what I don't even think what we're doing is going to be around for you know our kids which  
**[0:07:50-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:07:50):**  were my friends because they were using huge amounts of water for irrigation.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:07:57):**  They were highly safe making the soil saline.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:08:01):**  They were destroying the soils and they knew it and they realized it.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:08:06):**  And we're talking about millions of acres in this valley where alfalfa was grown.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:08:12):**  So I was able to see the worst of farm and ranching done by people who weren't farmers  
**[0:08:19-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:08:19):**  and ranchers before they came back from World War II.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:08:23):**  They were only doing it because they were given the land.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:08:26):**  They were subsidized to produce the alfalfa and it was a great way to make a living for  
**[0:08:30-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:08:30):**  them and they knew it was going to only be for a short period of time.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:08:34):**  If you look at a Google Earth today of that area I grew up in you'll only see you know  
**[0:08:40-0:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:08:40):**  a really random little amount of irrigated land for center pivot irrigation systems and  
**[0:08:48-0:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:08:48):**  all those millions of acres have gone back to horribly degraded desert.  
**[0:08:54-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:08:54):**  So it was a pretty negative and that became the genesis of my interest.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:09:01):**  What sort of effect did that have on you seeing the stark contrast between your fascination  
**[0:09:06-0:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:09:06):**  with the living world and those positive role models that you had but living in an area  
**[0:09:11-0:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:09:11):**  where the landscape and the ecology was being so obviously destroyed for short term gain?  
**[0:09:17-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:09:17):**  Well it was what prompted me to then really focus my education on seeing how I would be  
**[0:09:25-0:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:09:25):**  able to have some kind of an impact on reversing that.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:09:30):**  And when I was a junior in high school my family moved from the desert to the desert.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:09:38):**  My dad got transferred to what's called Space Division and he started to work on the moon  
**[0:09:41-0:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:09:41):**  program and the Apollo program and we moved from again the desert to where I could hitchhike  
**[0:09:51-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:09:51):**  about a mile and a half to the Pacific Ocean.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:09:55):**  And I had gone to the beach quite a bit with my parents when I was younger and I loved  
**[0:10:01-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:10:01):**  that also but I fell in love with the coastline, surfing, snorkeling, eventually scuba diving  
**[0:10:10-0:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:10:10):**  and my education which in high school at that point as I moved into college began to really  
**[0:10:17-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:10:17):**  focus on aquatic issues and aquatic ecology and I got a lot of education ended up with  
**[0:10:25-0:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:10:25):**  a bachelor's, a master's, a double major and my master's and bachelor's in chemistry and  
**[0:10:32-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:10:32):**  biology and then a PhD in aquatic ecology.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:10:36):**  And I was also fortunate again to continue that mentorship and most importantly I was  
**[0:10:41-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:10:41):**  mentored by a fellow named Carl Hubbs.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:10:44):**  Carl Hubbs is a well-known now deceased but aquatic ecologist, marine, the ocean related  
**[0:10:54-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:10:54):**  and he's the founder of SeaWorld.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:10:56):**  There's a whole story there that I would tell in a different mode but I was actually there  
**[0:11:02-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:11:02):**  the day that he got Shamu in and we rode on his back.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:11:08):**  I was there an intern and Carl went off to lunch and he told us not to get in this tank  
**[0:11:12-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:11:12):**  with this killer whale and all of us that were interns we immediately got in the tank  
**[0:11:17-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:11:17):**  and by the time he came back from lunch Shamu was throwing us up in the air and we were  
**[0:11:24-0:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:11:24):**  having a great time having fun.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:11:27):**  Carl was a great mentor, his whole goal was to reverse some of the horrible atrocities  
**[0:11:34-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:11:34):**  associated with whaling and tuna fisheries and dolphins that were maimed and injured  
**[0:11:44-0:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:11:44):**  so he took in a lot of rescue mammals.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:11:46):**  And then he had no idea about an amusement park and it was that day watching us with  
**[0:11:53-0:11:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:11:53):**  Shamu with a bunch of bankers that he was with and I had no idea but SeaWorld was about  
**[0:11:59-0:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:11:59):**  ready to go in the toilet financially that they convinced him that he should do an amusement  
**[0:12:04-0:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:12:04):**  type of a park along with the research work that he was doing.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:12:08):**  That was the genesis of what everybody knows as SeaWorld today.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:12:12):**  And so I got to see that and then I'm also sort of a serial entrepreneur and Dr. Hubbs  
**[0:12:18-0:12:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:12:18):**  helped get me into Scripps Institute of Oceanography for a Ph.D. program.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:12:24):**  And so a lot of what I learned was through mentors and I really highly recommend that  
**[0:12:29-0:12:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:12:29):**  all of you listening to this make sure you've got some mentors in your life.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:12:34):**  I really agree with that advice.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:12:36):**  Mentors have been a huge propellant in my life as well.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:12:40):**  Now that's a perfect transition.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:12:42):**  Could you start to tell us a little bit about how you transferred that educational base  
**[0:12:47-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:12:47):**  into the entrepreneurial world and turn some of these into viable business models.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:12:54):**  Well the first thing I did was when I was living out there in the desert and I was an  
**[0:12:59-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:12:59):**  only child I was given one of my chores was to mow our lawn and that was you know probably  
**[0:13:06-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:13:06):**  10 years old.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:13:07):**  By the time I was 12 I was mowing a whole bunch of neighbors lawns also.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:13:12):**  But I realized real quickly wait a minute I'm really good at selling this to little  
**[0:13:18-0:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:13:18):**  young ladies who like my cute 12 year old nature.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:13:22):**  And I got friends who have brothers who are 16 that are all looking for work and they  
**[0:13:27-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:13:27):**  have lawn mowers.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:13:28):**  Why don't I just start selling and I'll have these 16 year olds do all the mowing.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:13:33):**  So I have this little lawn mowing business when I was 12 that I learned later because  
**[0:13:38-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:13:38):**  I didn't get any of the money.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:13:39):**  The money went to my dad and mom and they put it in a checking account that I made more  
**[0:13:44-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:13:44):**  money that summer when I was 12 years old having these 16 year olds mow lawns than what  
**[0:13:51-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:13:51):**  my dad made as a pilot in the working for a private company doing test piloting.  
**[0:13:57-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:13:57):**  Oh my goodness.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:13:58):**  It was pretty amazing to me when I learned that later.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:14:01):**  That was the start of entrepreneurial and when I got into college I was doing consulting  
**[0:14:08-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:14:08):**  for a variety of different companies.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:14:10):**  I had again professors who saw that I had entrepreneurial interests and so I would do  
**[0:14:16-0:14:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:14:16):**  aquatic ecology consulting.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:14:19):**  When I got into grad school my professors there made a good portion of their income  
**[0:14:25-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:14:25):**  doing consulting.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:14:27):**  And again they used graduate students as what we called slave labor for their consulting  
**[0:14:34-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:14:34):**  work and I saw real quickly I didn't need them.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:14:37):**  I could do it directly and I didn't need to be a slave.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:14:40):**  So I started doing my own consulting as a grad student for a variety of these different  
**[0:14:47-0:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:14:47):**  clients that my professors have.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:14:50):**  And I had always was motivated that by the time I finished my education that I would  
**[0:14:55-0:15:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:14:55):**  go out and become a college professor and I would do research and I would because they  
**[0:15:00-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:15:00):**  had to do consulting to make an income I do the same thing.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:15:03):**  So when I finished grad school and got a professorship position I took with me a consulting group  
**[0:15:11-0:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:15:11):**  of clients that I already had and I continued to make income from them.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:15:16):**  Well pretty quickly I saw there was way more work than I could do myself.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:15:21):**  So I gathered much like I had done when I was 12 years old I started gathering grad  
**[0:15:27-0:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:15:27):**  students from different universities that were looking for work to do.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:15:31):**  I'd go out and sell the work and they do it and we formed a company and that company became  
**[0:15:38-0:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:15:38):**  a very large company about 10 years later and I had to make the decision to move away  
**[0:15:43-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:15:43):**  from either the professorship or from the consulting and I actually decided that I would  
**[0:15:49-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:15:49):**  become full time in the consulting business and doing environmental and ecological consulting  
**[0:15:55-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:15:55):**  and helping make the planet better.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:15:57):**  So that was the genesis of that.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:16:00):**  That's how I started doing that.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:16:02):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:16:04):**  Now let's focus down on this enterprise that you're perhaps best known for and that's aquaculture.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:16:10):**  Could you start by telling us first the difference between what hydroponics and aquaponics is  
**[0:16:16-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:16:16):**  because this is a sticking point I've heard from a lot of people.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:16:19):**  Yeah well my definition at least and I don't think it's too different than many others  
**[0:16:24-0:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:16:24):**  would be that anything that you grow that is not normally grown in water but that you're  
**[0:16:34-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:16:34):**  growing in water which would be usually considered terrestrial plants, edible plants normally.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:16:43):**  So lettuce, tomatoes, you know any kinds of fruiting plants or leafy plants that would  
**[0:16:52-0:17:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:16:52):**  normally have their roots based in soils if instead they're growing in a water media and  
**[0:17:01-0:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:17:01):**  they could still have their roots based in something solid but it's the water that's  
**[0:17:06-0:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:17:06):**  really providing all their nutritional value.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:17:10):**  That's hydroponics and if you combine that hydroponic process with the generation of  
**[0:17:20-0:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:17:20):**  the nutrients that those plants need occurring from animals, fish or some other kind of animal  
**[0:17:30-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:17:30):**  that's aquaponics.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:17:32):**  So an aquaponic system is hydroponics where the nutrients at least some of them are being  
**[0:17:38-0:17:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:17:38):**  produced by animals through their excrement, through their poop and their pee.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:17:45):**  And with just plain hydroponics you're purchasing.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:17:47):**  There's obviously a little more, a little more palaces than that but that's the case.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:17:52):**  Sure but those are definitions we can work with and so in that case with hydroponics  
**[0:17:56-0:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:17:56):**  you're usually purchasing some sort of fertilizer medium in order to put into the water?  
**[0:18:03-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:18:03):**  Standard hydroponics that would be the case yes that's correct.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:18:07):**  So now within that can you tell us about some of the systems that you've designed and managed  
**[0:18:11-0:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:18:11):**  and the types of foods and cycles with different organisms that you found to be really beneficial  
**[0:18:18-0:18:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:18:18):**  in these systems?  
**[0:18:19-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:18:19):**  I found pretty early on that was what was in concert with my overall, I didn't know  
**[0:18:27-0:18:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:18:27):**  this was even a term, restorative ecological mentality was that most aquaculture, so now  
**[0:18:37-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:18:37):**  I'm using, I'm not using ponics at all and aquaculture is growing things in water right?  
**[0:18:44-0:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:18:44):**  Anything really so that's like agriculture is broadly growing things to eat.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:18:49):**  Aquaculture is growing things in water to either consume or to produce into something  
**[0:18:55-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:18:55):**  that humans are going to use.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:18:57):**  That if aquaculture was done inappropriately it was completely out of balance with natural  
**[0:19:04-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:19:04):**  systems and there are lots of kinds of aquaculture that fit that definition.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:19:09):**  I didn't want to do that I didn't want to be involved in that at all and instead I wanted  
**[0:19:14-0:19:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:19:14):**  to use ecologically beneficial methods to create aquaculture systems that could provide  
**[0:19:25-0:19:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:19:25):**  food.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:19:26):**  Well one of those was what people call aquaponics because that's what natural ponds and aquatic  
**[0:19:32-0:19:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:19:32):**  systems do.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:19:34):**  A natural system is based on the balance between animals, plants, microbes, all the different  
**[0:19:42-0:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:19:42):**  six different groups of organisms that there are at a large level.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:19:47):**  So I got very intrigued and I started to study people, people like Sepp Holzer over in Austria,  
**[0:19:56-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:19:56):**  people like Jonathan Todd who was a mentor formed what was called the new alchemists  
**[0:20:02-0:20:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:20:02):**  back in the 1970s.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:20:06):**  Bob Rodale who was the founder of Rodale Press and Mother Earth News and he partnered with  
**[0:20:12-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:20:12):**  John Todd to do aquaculture in something that simulated natural systems and that involved  
**[0:20:22-0:20:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:20:22):**  some kind of a plant animal microbe interaction.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:20:29):**  And the real key was then could you get higher densities, could you produce what you were  
**[0:20:35-0:20:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:20:35):**  going to harvest at something more dense than a natural system might do and yet still keep  
**[0:20:42-0:20:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:20:42):**  it in balance.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:20:43):**  So I'll give you a very specific example.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:20:46):**  I have about a two acre pond here on my property in northern Colorado that if it was, by the  
**[0:20:53-0:20:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:20:53):**  way those are guinea fowls that you might be hearing in the background and I can't mute  
**[0:20:57-0:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:20:57):**  them.  
**[0:20:58-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:20:58):**  That's all right, that's good ambiance.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:20:59):**  That's what I do.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:21:01):**  Yeah, those guinea fowls kill rattlesnakes and we have rattlesnakes here and since we've  
**[0:21:07-0:21:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:21:07):**  had them and they're in their third year now, they actually, and they kill them and they  
**[0:21:12-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:21:12):**  annoy them.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:21:13):**  Rattlesnakes don't like sound and they'll run away from sound.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:21:17):**  So the guinea fowl will make noise and the rattlesnakes move somewhere else and they'll  
**[0:21:22-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:21:22):**  actually kill them.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:21:23):**  But anyway, back to aquaculture.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:21:24):**  Fantastic natural deterrent.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:21:25):**  Aquaculture, yeah, back to this pond.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:21:30):**  This pond would probably naturally produce maybe 1500 to 2000 adult bass, smallmouth  
**[0:21:40-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:21:40):**  bass.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:21:41):**  Well, I've got over 11,000 in this pond and it's very healthy and it's been doing this  
**[0:21:49-0:21:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:21:49):**  kind of production for about six years now.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:21:53):**  And the reason I can increase that density is that I manage the inputs into the pond.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:21:59):**  By the way, the pond's used for swimming.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:22:02):**  It's very clear.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:22:03):**  This pond's used for a lot of other purposes other than just producing fish.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:22:07):**  Although the primary purpose for the pond is fish production.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:22:11):**  So by managing the rest of the ecosystem, the land really more than the water, I'm able  
**[0:22:18-0:22:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:22:18):**  to create natural conditions that will produce higher densities of fish that can then be  
**[0:22:25-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:22:25):**  harvested for human consumption.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:22:28):**  By the way, we do no outside inputs into this pond.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:22:33):**  I'm not feeding these fish.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:22:36):**  I have 11,000 when it would normally produce this 1500 to 2000 and I'm not putting feed  
**[0:22:42-0:22:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:22:42):**  into it.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:22:43):**  But the feed are the natural organisms that are there.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:22:48):**  Crayfish, insects, both aquatic insects and those that happen to land on the water.  
**[0:22:54-0:23:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:22:54):**  Small fish, what we call bait fish or minnows and such is sometimes what they're called  
**[0:23:03-0:23:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:23:03):**  that these bigger fish, the bass will eat.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:23:05):**  These bass are carnivores.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:23:07):**  So they eat mostly other animals of some kind.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:23:14):**  So I mean, I didn't learn that overnight.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:23:17):**  That came from being with people like Carl Hubbs all the way back at the SeaWorld timeframe.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:23:24):**  And I had the pleasure of being around other graduate students who became aquaculturists  
**[0:23:30-0:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:23:30):**  through their whole lives and being around them and absorbing from them.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:23:35):**  And then spending a lot of time around natural systems myself that I just experimented with.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:23:42):**  And I made lots of mistakes, throwing lots of mud against the wall and seeing what stuck.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:23:48):**  Now through that trial and error period and all of this experience that you've gotten  
**[0:23:52-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:23:52):**  over the years, can you share some of the major learning curves that you were privy  
**[0:23:57-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:23:57):**  to in this process?  
**[0:23:58-0:24:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:23:58):**  What was it that helped you to bring about so much more production than would naturally  
**[0:24:04-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:24:04):**  occur in that size of a pond that you have on your land, for example?  
**[0:24:08-0:24:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:24:08):**  Well, unfortunately, you're not, you know, you and your audience are going to be a little  
**[0:24:12-0:24:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:24:12):**  bit appalled at what I'm going to say.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:24:15):**  But there's a saying in the aquaculture industry that you can't call yourself a fish farmer  
**[0:24:20-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:24:20):**  until you've killed a million fish.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:24:24):**  And unfortunately, aquaculture, unlike agriculture, I'm sitting also looking out at a bunch of  
**[0:24:30-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:24:30):**  our grazing animals, our alpacas and goats right now looking at alpacas.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:24:35):**  If they get sick or if they're going to have something that's going to negatively affect  
**[0:24:39-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:24:39):**  them, you're going to see it.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:24:41):**  You can look at them and see their health.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:24:44):**  You can see if their eyes are cloudy or they're just not acting like they normally do.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:24:51):**  Or maybe even longer term, you see them get skinny or you see just something about them.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:24:57):**  Their fleece isn't looking as healthy as it normally does.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:25:00):**  Their fleece gets wool.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:25:03):**  You can't see that like organisms.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:25:06):**  Aquatic organisms don't want to be seen.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:25:09):**  They're much more comfortable in water or in circumstances where they're hiding.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:25:14):**  You can't tell their health.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:25:16):**  And the things that will affect them will affect them very quickly and will potentially  
**[0:25:21-0:25:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:25:21):**  kill them quickly, like low oxygen levels or too high of temperature or too low temperature  
**[0:25:27-0:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:25:27):**  or chemical pollutants that would come into their environments.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:25:32):**  You won't see them get sick.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:25:34):**  They're just going to die.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:25:36):**  And you've got to learn what those parameters are that are going to hurt them.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:25:42):**  You've got to make sure you don't allow their living system to become polluted with them.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:25:49):**  And then you do kind of learn to watch a population in total and not individual elements of it.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:25:57):**  Which you would with agriculture, where you can look at an individual alpaca and see if  
**[0:26:02-0:26:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:26:02):**  it's sick.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:26:03):**  Whoa, maybe others are sick too.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:26:05):**  But in the fish population, you have to look at the whole population.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:26:09):**  And you only get glimpses of it.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:26:11):**  So you've got to be able to observe quickly.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:26:13):**  So I learned that.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:26:15):**  I learned that really early on.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:26:16):**  I learned that by scuba diving.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:26:17):**  I learned that by living with fish.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:26:19):**  I spent a lot of time in the water myself and learning how they behaved and what they  
**[0:26:25-0:26:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:26:25):**  might look at when I get a tenth of a second view of them when they're in the water.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:26:32):**  So again, sort of a trial and error process that you just learn through time.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:26:38):**  I mean, I'm you know, I'm a hundred times better aquaculturist today than I was when  
**[0:26:43-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:26:43):**  I was 25 years old.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:26:44):**  I thought I knew everything.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:26:46):**  Yeah, it's funny how that learning curve often goes when you get started.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:26:49):**  You have a lot of confidence.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:26:51):**  But as you get deeper into it, this has been the learning curve for me for many things.  
**[0:26:55-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:26:55):**  From language learning to farming and building buildings.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:26:59):**  Your confidence actually goes down as you become more experienced and knowledgeable.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:27:04):**  Yeah, again, so the key is I killed a lot of animals.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:27:08):**  I didn't do that intentionally and I didn't feel good about it while I was happening.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:27:12):**  But you learn a lot from the negative.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:27:16):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:27:17):**  So let's take a step back and get an idea of the major components in an aquaponic system.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:27:23):**  You mentioned your big pond, but I'm sure that's cycling the nutrients in the water  
**[0:27:28-0:27:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:27:28):**  to other elements in the system.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:27:31):**  Could you give us an overview of the main components of an aquaculture system?  
**[0:27:35-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:27:35):**  Well, the best aquaponic system is one that completely simulates a natural system.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:27:43):**  So I've got very discrete aquaponic systems also within about 30 yards of where I'm sitting  
**[0:27:51-0:27:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:27:51):**  that are in an open area that's not a natural pond.  
**[0:27:57-0:27:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:27:57):**  And they're two different kinds of systems.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:27:59):**  One of them is called a raft system where the plants grow in converted Dixie cups that  
**[0:28:06-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:28:06):**  have some pea gravel in them or river rock in them that serves as a foundation for their  
**[0:28:13-0:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:28:13):**  roots.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:28:14):**  That would be similar to what sediment in a pond would do for cattails that we're growing  
**[0:28:21-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:28:21):**  or most people would know and have seen that.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:28:23):**  I'm simulating those cattails with, in this case, basil and lettuce and a variety of other  
**[0:28:31-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:28:31):**  things that are growing in these Dixie cups.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:28:35):**  And the media, similar to the sediment, is these little pieces of river rock.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:28:41):**  That's one side.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:28:42):**  So now there's water in the system.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:28:45):**  And the water is similar to the water that would be in the pond.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:28:49):**  The pond's got water.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:28:51):**  This water has been treated by microbes.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:28:58):**  And those microbes, and they can be bacteria and they can be fungus, they could be viral  
**[0:29:04-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:29:04):**  because not all viruses are bad, by the way.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:29:07):**  They could be anything that's, again, you don't see it with the naked eye.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:29:13):**  And those microbes are growing all over the system, but we enhance their growth on a media.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:29:20):**  And in this case, the media is landscape fabric that is wadded up inside of a 55-gallon barrel.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:29:28):**  And the water that comes to the plants goes over that mesh of material and it's treated  
**[0:29:38-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:29:38):**  by all of the microbial actions that are occurring there.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:29:42):**  And mainly the nutrients that come from the last piece of the system I'll describe in  
**[0:29:47-0:29:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:29:47):**  a second, which is the fish, those nutrients, which is coming out of their rear ends as  
**[0:29:54-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:29:54):**  poop and pee, and let's just use nitrogen example, nitrogen comes out as ammonia.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:30:00):**  That ammonia has to go through a microbiological process that converts it to nitrites.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:30:08):**  Those nitrites actually can be harmful to plants, so you don't want them to stay as  
**[0:30:13-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:30:13):**  nitrites very long.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:30:15):**  And that's in a balanced system.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:30:18):**  The nitrites are literally there instantaneously, literally for seconds, and they're converted  
**[0:30:23-0:30:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:30:23):**  to nitrates by the microbes.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:30:26):**  The nitrates are what the plants can use to grow.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:30:29):**  That's the form of nitrogen they want.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:30:32):**  That all occurs as water flows over this mesh literally in seconds.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:30:39):**  The residence time for the water in this particular system while it's in that mesh is less than  
**[0:30:45-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:30:45):**  30 seconds probably.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:30:48):**  And yet it's cycling on a regular basis.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:30:51):**  Now let's go up.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:30:52):**  So that's equivalent to what's in the water in the pond and what's growing on the sides  
**[0:30:57-0:31:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:30:57):**  of the plants, growing on rocks, growing on stumps, growing on anything that's in the  
**[0:31:04-0:31:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:31:04):**  water.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:31:05):**  So it's in the water and it's on the surfaces in the water itself.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:31:09):**  Most of it actually in that material, that surface area on the borders of the pond and  
**[0:31:16-0:31:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:31:16):**  on the bottom of the pond.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:31:18):**  Finally you have the fish.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:31:19):**  And in this controlled system we have, in this case, bass, and it has about 10 of them,  
**[0:31:27-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:31:27):**  not very many.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:31:28):**  We put them in there in the spring as what are young of the year fish.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:31:33):**  And by the end of the season, because these systems we shut down in the winter, they're  
**[0:31:39-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:31:39):**  edible.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:31:40):**  They've grown to about half a pound or a little larger in size.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:31:45):**  Well they are producing this nutrient source, which is a combination of nitrogen, phosphorus,  
**[0:31:51-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:31:51):**  potassium, and other micronutrients that they poop and pee.  
**[0:31:57-0:31:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:31:57):**  And that's what goes into this mesh.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:31:59):**  Well in a pond, obviously you've got fish, you've got insects, you've got microorganisms  
**[0:32:08-0:32:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:32:08):**  that I mentioned that are larger.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:32:10):**  You've got what we call zooplankton and phytoplankton algae.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:32:14):**  You've got crayfish, so you've got different kinds of crustaceans.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:32:18):**  You've got mollusks.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:32:19):**  Well, the aquaponics system also, I guarantee I can find multiple snails.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:32:27):**  I don't know where they came from.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:32:28):**  They came from birds probably flying.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:32:30):**  So by the way, we don't feed anything in these aquaponics systems either.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:32:34):**  They're naturally open and insects will fly into them.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:32:38):**  Frogs will jump into them and they're pretty stupid frogs.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:32:41):**  The bass will eat the frogs.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:32:43):**  And there are no other outside inputs.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:32:47):**  So it's simulating that natural pond.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:32:50):**  And that's the basis of ecologically balanced aquaculture systems.  
**[0:32:55-0:33:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:32:55):**  Now in order to find this homeostasis that you're looking for, because like you said,  
**[0:33:00-0:33:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:33:00):**  the life forms inside of the water don't like to be seen.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:33:02):**  They're hard to diagnose if something's going wrong.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:33:05):**  And usually you don't find out about it until it's too late.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:33:08):**  They've died.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:33:09):**  So what sort of diagnostic tools do you use to be able to stay on top of the health and  
**[0:33:15-0:33:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:33:15):**  the oxygen levels that allow this much life that normally wouldn't happen without some  
**[0:33:22-0:33:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:33:22):**  propellants to go on in a healthy way?  
**[0:33:26-0:33:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:33:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:33:27):**  When we have a newer system, we do lots of water testing.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:33:30):**  So we're actually doing testing for temperature, pH, oxygen, nitrogens of various different  
**[0:33:37-0:33:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:33:37):**  types, nitrates, ammonia, nitrites.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:33:40):**  We really want to be paying careful attention that we don't end up having nitrites, phosphorus,  
**[0:33:47-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:33:47):**  a variety of things.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:33:48):**  By the way, with really inexpensive testing kits that you can buy online or that you can  
**[0:33:54-0:33:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:33:54):**  get through, in our case, we can go to a pet store and get them where they're using color  
**[0:33:59-0:34:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:33:59):**  metrics and very simple to do and inexpensive.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:34:02):**  Interestingly, though, once the system becomes stable, and these particular systems, they've  
**[0:34:08-0:34:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:34:08):**  been running for almost 10 years, and we shut them down in the winter, but we don't change  
**[0:34:13-0:34:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:34:13):**  anything about the system.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:34:15):**  We haven't done water monitoring in them, other than if it's for experimental purposes  
**[0:34:20-0:34:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:34:20):**  in years because we know what the systems will do and how they respond.  
**[0:34:26-0:34:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:34:26):**  And then visually, in these artificial systems, we can't see the fish.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:34:32):**  We keep them in places where they can stay in that comfort level they like.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:34:38):**  The plants are very visible because these are now terrestrial plants.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:34:41):**  So we do look for them.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:34:43):**  We look and see if they're brown and they're not colored like they should be, or their  
**[0:34:47-0:34:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:34:47):**  leaves are wilting, or if there's aphids, some kind of infestation by insects.  
**[0:34:52-0:34:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:34:52):**  We look at their roots.  
**[0:34:53-0:34:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:34:53):**  We pull out containers that are in these rafts and look at the roots, see if they're healthy.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:34:58):**  So we're actually observing them, much like you would in an agriculture, a soil-based  
**[0:35:03-0:35:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:35:03):**  agriculture system.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:35:05):**  But we do do water testing, and that was what I would highly recommend for anybody in a  
**[0:35:09-0:35:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:35:09):**  new system to do.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:35:10):**  Now you've taken care of all of your feed inputs by just creating a healthy ecosystem  
**[0:35:16-0:35:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:35:16):**  that can support the life inside of it.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:35:18):**  But there are certain inputs that are required in an aquaponic system like this, such as  
**[0:35:23-0:35:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:35:23):**  pumps and obviously the equipment to get it set up for the infrastructure side.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:35:28):**  Can you talk a little bit about what's needed to get one of these started and how you've  
**[0:35:32-0:35:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:35:32):**  sort of worked to minimize the importation of energy for a more efficient system?  
**[0:35:39-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:35:39):**  Yeah, we use incredibly low power consumptive pumps.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:35:45):**  That is the only way out.  
**[0:35:46-0:35:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:35:46):**  So the system I just described, which will produce about, if you properly managed it  
**[0:35:53-0:35:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:35:53):**  throughout the growing season here in Colorado, which would be May through October, you could  
**[0:35:58-0:36:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:35:58):**  produce enough greens to produce the caloric needs of a family of four from this system.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:36:06):**  It uses a pump that will use about a dollar's worth of energy a month, and that's at eight  
**[0:36:17-0:36:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:36:17):**  cents a kilowatt-hour cost, and that's a fairly low cost.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:36:22):**  Where we're at here, we have cheap energy, really.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:36:25):**  If you were in Europe, it would be like 40 cents a kilowatt-hour, and so it would be  
**[0:36:30-0:36:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:36:30):**  eight times that, so you'd have $8 a month for your energy cost.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:36:36):**  That's the only moving part that's in the system that's not ecologically balanced.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:36:46):**  In this case, we used liner that we got from disposed billboards that were being thrown  
**[0:36:57-0:36:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:36:57):**  away.  
**[0:36:58-0:37:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:36:58):**  Oh, yeah, I use those too sometimes.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:37:00):**  They're great.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:37:01):**  Yeah, 40 mil, and they're excellent.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:37:07):**  We use carpet that we pick up in dumpster diving to protect our system from being punctured.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:37:14):**  This water system is dug into the ground, so we dug with shovels.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:37:19):**  We use natural rock that we have here to form the sides of it.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:37:27):**  We dug the hole, and we used that up above.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:37:31):**  We secured the liner that I described with that.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:37:33):**  We use 55-gallon quote.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:37:36):**  They're called blue barrels that come in all kinds of colors.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:37:40):**  That used to be we could get those for free.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:37:42):**  Gosh, they've gotten up to where the stores sell them for 40 bucks each now.  
**[0:37:47-0:37:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:37:47):**  It's actually really hard to get them for free.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:37:50):**  We could still find them at auctions at places for 10 bucks or five bucks, but we were fortunate.  
**[0:37:56-0:38:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:37:56):**  We accumulated a lot of them back when they were free, I mean hundreds of them.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:38:00):**  We cut them in half in this particular system to form our sump that the pump sits in.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:38:07):**  Actually, we didn't cut it in half.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:38:08):**  We cut a gap out of this particular one.  
**[0:38:12-0:38:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:38:12):**  That pump sits down in the sump, and we have a pipe that's an ABS pipe that goes up to  
**[0:38:21-0:38:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:38:21):**  the fish tank.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:38:22):**  The fish tank is actually a baker's tank that we got from an auction for little to nothing  
**[0:38:29-0:38:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:38:29):**  because it was a waste that somebody had.  
**[0:38:31-0:38:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:38:31):**  I live by the theory of one man's trash being another man's treasure.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:38:37):**  I'm the guy who takes the treasures more often than not.  
**[0:38:42-0:38:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:38:42):**  In this particular case, we have two more 55-gallon barrels that are cut off of them  
**[0:38:51-0:38:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:38:51):**  using pot for that mesh that I mentioned that we've got crammed in.  
**[0:38:58-0:39:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:38:58):**  That's really the gel for the whole system.  
**[0:39:03-0:39:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:39:03):**  If you look at costs in US dollars, anybody could put this system together for less than  
**[0:39:09-0:39:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:39:09):**  $50 probably if they could find those blue barrels inexpensively, maybe $100 if they  
**[0:39:16-0:39:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:39:16):**  had to buy the blue barrels.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:39:19):**  It's been running for 10 years.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:39:22):**  I think we've maybe replaced the pump once.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:39:25):**  That pump is about a $20 pump that you could buy on Amazon.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:39:31):**  You usually buy new pumps, but sometimes we get refurbished ones or people are giving  
**[0:39:35-0:39:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:39:35):**  them away on Craigslist and other things.  
**[0:39:38-0:39:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:39:38):**  It's about a little bit bigger than a 20-gallon aquarium pump.  
**[0:39:42-0:39:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:39:42):**  It's not that large.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:39:45):**  We've got some bigger systems that we use bigger pumps on, obviously, right adjacent  
**[0:39:49-0:39:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:39:49):**  to the one I've been describing.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:39:50):**  We have a aquaponic system that uses media.  
**[0:39:53-0:40:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:39:53):**  It's in 16 55-gallon drums that we cut in half that we put river rock in.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:40:01):**  The plants grow right down into the river rock, which provides both the biological treatment  
**[0:40:08-0:40:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:40:08):**  part of the system and the foundation for the plants.  
**[0:40:11-0:40:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:40:11):**  Then the fish are living in a big stock tank that we converted.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:40:15):**  It's a 300-gallon farm stock tank.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:40:19):**  The pump is in there and the fish live in there, and then they just pump up through  
**[0:40:24-0:40:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:40:24):**  pipes up to the fish.  
**[0:40:26-0:40:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:40:26):**  We collect all the water as it leaves the media portion of the system into drain pipes.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:40:31):**  This particular system has lots of more pipes, and then it goes back into the tank with the  
**[0:40:36-0:40:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:40:36):**  fish.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:40:38):**  It's a simpler system than a raft system.  
**[0:40:43-0:40:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:40:43):**  Those are two of the three primary types of aquaponic systems.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:40:46):**  The third type is called a nutrient film system, where instead of your roots being in water  
**[0:40:52-0:40:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:40:52):**  all the time, they're only inundated with water for part of the time, and you run water  
**[0:40:57-0:40:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:40:57):**  through tubes to them.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:40:59):**  Otherwise, all the other pieces of the system are the same.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:41:02):**  We actually put those kinds of systems out on top of our ponds, much like the Chinese  
**[0:41:07-0:41:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:41:07):**  do and the Mayans did back 5,000 years ago in Mexico to grow plants, to grow terrestrial  
**[0:41:18-0:41:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:41:18):**  plants.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:41:19):**  I'm glad to hear you've got some animals that you can also develop.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:41:23):**  I'm actually recording this at a buddy's house.  
**[0:41:25-0:41:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:41:25):**  Normally, we don't have dogs.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:41:27):**  We have goats and chickens making noise.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:41:30):**  So, a little bit, we're just down the hill from our farm at the moment.  
**[0:41:34-0:41:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:41:34):**  So, give me an idea of some of the other harvests that you get off of this.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:41:38):**  Aside from the fish that you mentioned, what are the main things that you're producing  
**[0:41:42-0:41:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:41:42):**  as far as plant life?  
**[0:41:44-0:41:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:41:44):**  You can grow a whole wide variety of fruiting and or leafy plants.  
**[0:41:50-0:41:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:41:50):**  It's a little bit difficult to grow rooted plants in water-based systems because the  
**[0:41:57-0:42:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:41:57):**  roots are used to having the resistance soil to form.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:42:03):**  So, like a terracotta, but it'll be rather difficult.  
**[0:42:08-0:42:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:42:08):**  It will form and it won't get a large amount of really don't have the alternative.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:42:16):**  So, the two systems I just described, I would get over the last 100 different types of greens,  
**[0:42:28-0:42:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:42:28):**  grass, and the same the different kinds of herbs.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:42:32):**  So, it's difficult to get into tomatoes, squashes, peppers.  
**[0:42:44-0:42:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:42:44):**  We usually try to avoid really large fruiting plants like watermelons or cantaloupes, let's  
**[0:42:51-0:42:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:42:51):**  say, because they don't fit real well into a system.  
**[0:42:54-0:42:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:42:54):**  They want to grow out of these containers that we grow things in.  
**[0:42:59-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:42:59):**  We've grown perennial plants.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:43:01):**  So, you could grow trees, Dixie cups, diameters up to an inch, let's say, and grow a plant  
**[0:43:11-0:43:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:43:11):**  that might store you multiple years in a row.  
**[0:43:16-0:43:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:43:16):**  So, the plant side of it is very diverse and you don't have to have fish.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:43:22):**  You could grow a whole bunch of crayfish rather than the fish.  
**[0:43:26-0:43:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:43:26):**  The problem with crayfish is they tend to eat each other.  
**[0:43:28-0:43:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:43:28):**  So, you got to be careful with how many you put in a system.  
**[0:43:33-0:43:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:43:33):**  So, it's a little bit counterintuitive to most of us still, especially who are used  
**[0:43:38-0:43:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:43:38):**  to more conventional farming, that the root systems from these plants can survive underwater  
**[0:43:43-0:43:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:43:43):**  for so long if they're not normally adapted to do so.  
**[0:43:48-0:43:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:43:48):**  And there doesn't seem to be any sort of hang ups within the system for having the root  
**[0:43:54-0:43:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:43:54):**  inundated.  
**[0:43:55-0:44:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:43:55):**  And is it just because there's enough oxygen in the water that the roots don't have trouble?  
**[0:44:00-0:44:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:44:00):**  That's a great question.  
**[0:44:02-0:44:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:44:02):**  I get asked it all the time.  
**[0:44:04-0:44:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:44:04):**  I'm not going to answer it as well as a botanist would.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:44:07):**  I'm an animal guy for the most part, but I've obviously been around plants for a lot of  
**[0:44:12-0:44:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:44:12):**  years.  
**[0:44:13-0:44:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:44:13):**  But I don't know that there is a good explanation.  
**[0:44:16-0:44:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:44:16):**  Nobody's ever given one.  
**[0:44:18-0:44:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:44:18):**  Why would a terrestrial plant, any of them, corn, lettuce, tomatoes, that evolved to grow  
**[0:44:27-0:44:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:44:27):**  in soil, why would it do really well, actually thrive with its roots growing in water?  
**[0:44:34-0:44:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:44:34):**  But they do.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:44:35):**  And I think it does have to do with the fact that there is a really good level and it is  
**[0:44:44-0:44:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:44:44):**  a consistent level of conditions, environmental conditions, that that plant really likes.  
**[0:44:53-0:45:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:44:53):**  And so it's oxygen, it's nutrients, it's pH, it's all the different chemical parameters  
**[0:45:01-0:45:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:45:01):**  that are affecting those roots.  
**[0:45:06-0:45:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:45:06):**  The plants thrive on.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:45:09):**  And remember, their stems and their leaves, those are all in the soil.  
**[0:45:13-0:45:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:45:13):**  They're in the air, they're in terrestrial air, just like they'd be if the roots were  
**[0:45:18-0:45:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:45:18):**  in soil.  
**[0:45:19-0:45:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:45:19):**  And I think because of that, the plant's still getting so much from its air-impacted surfaces  
**[0:45:28-0:45:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:45:28):**  that it sort of balances out if there's some negatives coming from the water.  
**[0:45:34-0:45:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:45:34):**  Another question people ask is, what about root rot?  
**[0:45:37-0:45:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:45:37):**  You do not get root rot.  
**[0:45:39-0:45:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:45:39):**  Never seen it in an aquaponic system.  
**[0:45:42-0:45:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:45:42):**  And the explanation I've gotten from, again, botanists for that is root rot occurs when  
**[0:45:49-0:45:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:45:49):**  roots are wet and dry.  
**[0:45:52-0:45:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:45:52):**  So they're in cycles.  
**[0:45:53-0:45:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:45:53):**  They go from being very wet to being dry, to being wet to being dry.  
**[0:45:58-0:46:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:45:58):**  In this case, your roots are wet all the time.  
**[0:46:01-0:46:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:46:01):**  That's the only time that I've seen plants suffer in aquaponic systems is when their  
**[0:46:07-0:46:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:46:07):**  roots dry out.  
**[0:46:08-0:46:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:46:08):**  If for whatever reason you allow the roots to get dry, they'll really start to struggle.  
**[0:46:13-0:46:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:46:13):**  Yeah, I mean, it makes sense on a certain level, but it's still counterintuitive.  
**[0:46:17-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:46:17):**  And I think that's one of the most interesting and exciting things about the potential of  
**[0:46:21-0:46:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:46:21):**  aquaponics is that it's still kind of in its infancy stages, at least the way that we're  
**[0:46:25-0:46:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:46:25):**  producing with them now.  
**[0:46:27-0:46:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:46:27):**  And there's a ton of room for innovation and fine tuning of these systems.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:46:31):**  I can see you've already done that within your own.  
**[0:46:34-0:46:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:46:34):**  What are some of the areas that you would like to see more research and advancement  
**[0:46:37-0:46:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:46:37):**  done in the field of aquaponics?  
**[0:46:40-0:46:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:46:40):**  Well, it's using more ecologically balanced systems, like I was describing our ponds.  
**[0:46:50-0:46:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:46:50):**  And secondly, too many people believe that you can produce commercial quantities of plants  
**[0:46:57-0:47:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:46:57):**  in an aquaponic system only using the nutrients derived from fish.  
**[0:47:03-0:47:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:47:03):**  That's a fallacy.  
**[0:47:05-0:47:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:47:05):**  Fish do not produce enough potassium, for example.  
**[0:47:08-0:47:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:47:08):**  They don't produce enough phosphorus.  
**[0:47:11-0:47:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:47:11):**  They'll produce plenty of nitrogen.  
**[0:47:13-0:47:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:47:13):**  Get all the nitrogen you need.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:47:14):**  You'll have all the carbon you need, but not enough of some of the other nutrients.  
**[0:47:19-0:47:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:47:19):**  So you've got to treat it like a hydroponic system.  
**[0:47:22-0:47:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:47:22):**  Somehow you've got to add phosphorus to the system, or you've got to add other nutrients.  
**[0:47:29-0:47:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:47:29):**  And so I'd like to see us start to really focus on what are called decoupled systems,  
**[0:47:39-0:47:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:47:39):**  where at certain times the fish or the aquatic can grow without plants, and the plants can  
**[0:47:50-0:47:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:47:50):**  grow without the fish.  
**[0:47:51-0:47:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:47:51):**  And then there's times when they grow together.  
**[0:47:54-0:47:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:47:54):**  And you do that by the way you move your water around the system.  
**[0:47:58-0:48:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:47:58):**  That's number one.  
**[0:48:00-0:48:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:48:00):**  Number two, and this is what I'd rather see more of.  
**[0:48:04-0:48:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:48:04):**  In the United States alone, we have over a million ponds that are an acre or more in  
**[0:48:12-0:48:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:48:12):**  size that are not used for being productive from an aquapon.  
**[0:48:18-0:48:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:48:18):**  We could be growing floating islands of plants, lettuce, basil, that aren't going to get preyed  
**[0:48:26-0:48:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:48:26):**  on by deer and other things in those ponds and be eating them.  
**[0:48:33-0:48:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:48:33):**  And we could produce enough to serve the American public in those ponds that are not being used  
**[0:48:39-0:48:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:48:39):**  for any purposes.  
**[0:48:41-0:48:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:48:41):**  So start thinking more about natural aquaponics and less about these really sophisticated  
**[0:48:49-0:48:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:48:49):**  systems.  
**[0:48:50-0:48:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:48:50):**  And then finally, where you're at.  
**[0:48:53-0:49:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:48:53):**  You can use aquaponics or I'm just going to call it hybridized aquaculture, growing plants  
**[0:49:03-0:49:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:49:03):**  and animals together in very low income, very low water.  
**[0:49:11-0:49:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:49:11):**  You're in an area that you get a lot of rainfall, but take the areas along the midsection of  
**[0:49:17-0:49:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:49:17):**  the world in sub-Saharan Africa, for example, or in other parts of Asia, or in Australia,  
**[0:49:25-0:49:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:49:25):**  or in South America, where there isn't much water.  
**[0:49:30-0:49:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:49:30):**  And you literally could be growing the same kinds of plants and possibly animals that  
**[0:49:38-0:49:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:49:38):**  you'd grow in much more water rich areas and by cycling that water and using it in something  
**[0:49:46-0:49:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:49:46):**  like a natural aquaculture, aquaponic type system.  
**[0:49:51-0:49:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:49:51):**  Again, I hate to use that word aquaponics at times, but those are things all those three  
**[0:49:57-0:50:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:49:57):**  things I'd like to see people research on.  
**[0:50:00-0:50:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:50:00):**  See that was something that really struck me when I first started researching aquaponics  
**[0:50:04-0:50:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:50:04):**  is that it actually uses less water than conventional agriculture because so much of it is cycled.  
**[0:50:10-0:50:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:50:10):**  It seems like it's a very consumptive as far as water goes system, but because the water  
**[0:50:16-0:50:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:50:16):**  is constantly being recycled through the system, it's less consumptive than irrigating the  
**[0:50:21-0:50:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:50:21):**  land for example.  
**[0:50:23-0:50:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:50:23):**  Oh, it's probably 90% more efficient that way.  
**[0:50:27-0:50:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:50:27):**  We talk about, you know, if growing something in a terrestrial system requires 10 gallons  
**[0:50:35-0:50:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:50:35):**  of water, it's going to require only about a gallon of water to grow that same amount  
**[0:50:42-0:50:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:50:42):**  of plant for example in a natural aquaponics and a hybridized aquaculture system.  
**[0:50:52-0:50:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:50:52):**  Yeah, that's remarkable.  
**[0:50:54-0:50:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:50:54):**  Now let's switch gears here a little bit before we wrap up the interview.  
**[0:50:58-0:51:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:50:58):**  You've got an amazing educational outlet known as the economic action team or EAT for short.  
**[0:51:06-0:51:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:51:06):**  Could you give us a little overview for my listeners who haven't explored that resource  
**[0:51:10-0:51:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:51:10):**  yet and just the breadth of knowledge and resources that you've helped to bring together  
**[0:51:17-0:51:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:51:17):**  on this online platform.  
**[0:51:20-0:51:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:51:20):**  Thank you for the ability to do that because I'd love to get the word out about what we're  
**[0:51:24-0:51:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:51:24):**  doing to more people because you can take advantage of it for free.  
**[0:51:28-0:51:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:51:28):**  We also have some paid ends, but it's mainly for free.  
**[0:51:33-0:51:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:51:33):**  Honestly, what it came from was my interest in education, which I've been interested in  
**[0:51:41-0:51:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:51:41):**  my whole life.  
**[0:51:43-0:51:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:51:43):**  Even though I stopped being a full-time college professor about 30 years ago, I have continued  
**[0:51:48-0:51:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:51:48):**  to be a professor.  
**[0:51:50-0:51:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:51:50):**  I still have professorships at universities.  
**[0:51:53-0:51:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:51:53):**  I teach graduate students and others, and I love doing online education since it's developed  
**[0:51:58-0:52:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:51:58):**  about 10 years ago.  
**[0:52:01-0:52:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:52:01):**  I found that in the, let's call it broadly, the green space that you could go listen to  
**[0:52:07-0:52:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:52:07):**  individual webinars, and there were great ones out there.  
**[0:52:10-0:52:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:52:10):**  You could get teaching all over by just searching around, but there weren't courses.  
**[0:52:17-0:52:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:52:17):**  You couldn't take a whole year, for example, on a topic and learn about it.  
**[0:52:23-0:52:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:52:23):**  Well, I thought, what if we could get experts, the world's best in certain topics, to teach  
**[0:52:32-0:52:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:52:32):**  about that topic over the internet?  
**[0:52:39-0:52:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:52:39):**  And if we could make that available, and if we could make it available live and as a replay,  
**[0:52:44-0:52:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:52:44):**  that would be wonderful.  
**[0:52:46-0:52:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:52:46):**  So we started that a little more than two years ago with one course.  
**[0:52:52-0:52:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:52:52):**  I was teaching a backyard aquaculture course, and soon thereafter, Mark Sheppard started  
**[0:52:59-0:53:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:52:59):**  teaching a forest ecology course.  
**[0:53:03-0:53:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:53:03):**  That forest ecology course lasted for a year, and Mark taught his guts out, and it was unique  
**[0:53:11-0:53:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:53:11):**  information.  
**[0:53:13-0:53:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:53:13):**  Everything I did for that first backyard aquaculture course was also unique.  
**[0:53:18-0:53:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:53:18):**  You couldn't find it anywhere else on the internet, and we just taught using our own  
**[0:53:23-0:53:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:53:23):**  styles, and everybody teaches differently.  
**[0:53:26-0:53:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:53:26):**  Mark is really organized.  
**[0:53:28-0:53:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:53:28):**  I'm typically somewhat unorganized, and I like to use lots of resources from the internet,  
**[0:53:36-0:53:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:53:36):**  and I'll Google things and show them to people as I'm teaching about a topic.  
**[0:53:41-0:53:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:53:41):**  And so we started with those first two.  
**[0:53:45-0:53:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:53:45):**  Now we're a little more than two years later, and this week we'll have 10 different courses  
**[0:53:51-0:53:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:53:51):**  being taught, and they'll be on everything from solar energy in an ecological manner  
**[0:53:59-0:54:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:53:59):**  that you can use in your home or your business, to chicken culture and how you can do natural  
**[0:54:09-0:54:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:54:09):**  forest-raised or pasture-raised chickens, to courses on health and how do you improve  
**[0:54:17-0:54:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:54:17):**  your hormonal health or how do you improve your behaviors, to businesses.  
**[0:54:24-0:54:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:54:24):**  How do you keep a balance sheet?  
**[0:54:26-0:54:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:54:26):**  How do you do the books for a farming business?  
**[0:54:30-0:54:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:54:30):**  All of them have to do with the really simple definition of economics, which is teaching  
**[0:54:37-0:54:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:54:37):**  people to make people on the planet better and to make a little bit of money doing it.  
**[0:54:43-0:54:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:54:43):**  Not a lot, to make something appropriate.  
**[0:54:47-0:54:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:54:47):**  So our goal is to be 24 hours a day, and we're up to some weeks we have as many as 15 hours.  
**[0:54:55-0:54:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:54:55):**  This week will probably be 12, 13 hours.  
**[0:54:59-0:55:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:54:59):**  Other weeks, we're a little less, well, really not ever less than that.  
**[0:55:02-0:55:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:55:02):**  And our goal is to be 24 hours a day.  
**[0:55:05-0:55:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:55:05):**  Who knows if we'll ever reach that, but we're going to keep growing it.  
**[0:55:08-0:55:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:55:08):**  We're always looking for new instructors who want to teach.  
**[0:55:11-0:55:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:55:11):**  So the benefits to them are that we share all the recorded information with them, and  
**[0:55:18-0:55:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:55:18):**  they can use it for other purposes themselves.  
**[0:55:20-0:55:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:55:20):**  They can create courses.  
**[0:55:21-0:55:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:55:21):**  They can do other things with it.  
**[0:55:23-0:55:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:55:23):**  So if anybody that's listening to this happens to know somebody they'd love to learn from,  
**[0:55:29-0:55:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:55:29):**  refer them to them, but go talk to them.  
**[0:55:33-0:55:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:55:33):**  We're not scared of talking to anybody.  
**[0:55:35-0:55:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:55:35):**  I'll go ask Nobel Prize winners to come teach for us.  
**[0:55:38-0:55:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:55:38):**  It makes sense.  
**[0:55:40-0:55:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:55:40):**  But we only want to have people teach that are experts in what they're doing.  
**[0:55:46-0:55:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:55:46):**  We have a saying is that we won't let somebody teach you just learned about it in a classroom.  
**[0:55:51-0:55:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:55:51):**  We want to have people teach that have done what they're teaching about.  
**[0:55:56-0:55:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:55:56):**  We've had about 100 different speakers.  
**[0:55:59-0:56:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:55:59):**  Sometimes people just ask, and other people will teach the courses.  
**[0:56:05-0:56:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:56:05):**  And again, it's free.  
**[0:56:10-0:56:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:56:10):**  And we have about 20,000 people in our community.  
**[0:56:13-0:56:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:56:13):**  So it's not growing as fast as we'd like, but it's growing fine.  
**[0:56:17-0:56:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:56:17):**  And we also want to eventually create live places that people all around the world.  
**[0:56:22-0:56:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:56:22):**  So maybe Oliver would be teaching a course on natural building in Guatemala, and people  
**[0:56:29-0:56:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:56:29):**  from all over South America would come there because they learned about Imanit.  
**[0:56:34-0:56:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:56:34):**  That's the goal.  
**[0:56:35-0:56:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:56:35):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:56:36-0:56:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:56:36):**  Well, I can attest that I have personally gotten a ton of value from these platforms.  
**[0:56:40-0:56:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:56:40):**  I've really liked Mark Sheppard's webinar series, like you mentioned.  
**[0:56:44-0:56:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:56:44):**  William Horvath's series that he did last season was phenomenal.  
**[0:56:49-0:56:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:56:49):**  I learned a ton from yours as well.  
**[0:56:52-0:56:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:56:52):**  And I would really encourage anybody who's listening now to check out that platform.  
**[0:56:55-0:56:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:56:55):**  Like he said, all of the resources are free.  
**[0:56:58-0:57:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:56:58):**  There are memberships that you can buy as well.  
**[0:57:00-0:57:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:57:00):**  But there's so much that you can get just by plugging into the webinar series as they  
**[0:57:05-0:57:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:57:05):**  come out.  
**[0:57:07-0:57:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:57:07):**  So before I let you go, Wayne, is there any other way that our listeners can get in touch  
**[0:57:12-0:57:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:57:12):**  with you, contact your organizations, or just learn more?  
**[0:57:15-0:57:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:57:15):**  Yeah, thank you for that.  
**[0:57:17-0:57:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:57:17):**  I am probably most responsive to email.  
**[0:57:23-0:57:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:57:23):**  And my email is really simple, Wayne doorband, and I'm sure as Oliver puts this up, my name  
**[0:57:29-0:57:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:57:29):**  will be there.  
**[0:57:30-0:57:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:57:30):**  So it's firstandlastnameatgmail.com.  
**[0:57:33-0:57:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:57:33):**  I have some other ones too, but that one will get you to me.  
**[0:57:38-0:57:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:57:38):**  So email me.  
**[0:57:39-0:57:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:57:39):**  I will absolutely get back to you.  
**[0:57:42-0:57:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:57:42):**  Or join the EAT community.  
**[0:57:44-0:57:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:57:44):**  So it's more than just our webinars.  
**[0:57:45-0:57:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:57:45):**  There's other stuff in there.  
**[0:57:48-0:57:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:57:48):**  And it's really that simple.  
**[0:57:50-0:57:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:57:50):**  It's c-o-u-n-i-t-y dot e-a-t-e-t community.  
**[0:57:54-0:57:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:57:54):**  C-o-m-m-u-n-i-t-y dot com.  
**[0:57:59-0:58:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:57:59):**  And when you go there, if you are not a member, it'll just ask you for your email address  
**[0:58:04-0:58:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:58:04):**  and name.  
**[0:58:05-0:58:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:58:05):**  It'll send you login instructions, ask you to create a password, and then you're there.  
**[0:58:11-0:58:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:58:11):**  You can go do it whenever you'd like.  
**[0:58:13-0:58:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:58:13):**  And you can then make comments.  
**[0:58:17-0:58:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:58:17):**  You can ask for info.  
**[0:58:20-0:58:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:58:20):**  There's my email address is plastered all over that.  
**[0:58:23-0:58:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:58:23):**  If you're in the States, you can text or call.  
**[0:58:27-0:58:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:58:27):**  Also, we're really visible on the Internet, and I'm very transparent.  
**[0:58:32-0:58:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:58:32):**  I'm not really afraid of people kind of knowing our office phone number or others.  
**[0:58:36-0:58:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:58:36):**  I probably won't give those right now because hopefully this is going all over the world  
**[0:58:40-0:58:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:58:40):**  and people probably aren't going to call the U.S.  
**[0:58:43-0:58:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:58:43):**  But I've got Skype and other things, and you'll get the knowledge about that.  
**[0:58:46-0:58:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:58:46):**  So probably either the email or go to the EAT community and join.  
**[0:58:51-0:58:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:58:51):**  And I'll be sure to put links to those as well on the show notes for this episode on  
**[0:58:55-0:58:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:58:55):**  the website as well.  
**[0:58:57-0:59:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:58:57):**  So Wayne, thank you so much for your generosity of time and knowledge today.  
**[0:59:02-0:59:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:59:02):**  It's been a real pleasure talking to you, and I've had so much fun and learned so much  
**[0:59:05-0:59:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:59:05):**  from all of these resources that you've been putting online.  
**[0:59:08-0:59:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:59:08):**  So I want to thank you for those as well.  
**[0:59:10-0:59:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:59:10):**  Well, and Oliver, thank you.  
**[0:59:11-0:59:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:59:11):**  You're doing a really special thing for the world too.  
**[0:59:14-0:59:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:59:14):**  And guess what?  
**[0:59:15-0:59:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:59:15):**  All of you can do something.  
**[0:59:17-0:59:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:59:17):**  Just do a little if you can.  
**[0:59:19-0:59:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:59:19):**  Anything.  
**[0:59:20-0:59:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:59:20):**  Don't ever feel bad by thinking, wow, I just can't do enough.  
**[0:59:24-0:59:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:59:24):**  Just make a little change.  
**[0:59:25-0:59:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:59:25):**  Pick up trash.  
**[0:59:26-0:59:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:59:26):**  I could tell all kinds of stories, and we've had speakers about how they've turned picking  
**[0:59:30-0:59:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:59:30):**  up trash into businesses and so on.  
**[0:59:33-0:59:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:59:33):**  Or make sure that you don't create refuse.  
**[0:59:38-0:59:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:59:38):**  Recycle as much as possible.  
**[0:59:39-0:59:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:59:39):**  Do anything.  
**[0:59:40-0:59:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:59:40):**  Do little things.  
**[0:59:41-0:59:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:59:41):**  But man, what Oliver is doing also is incredible.  
**[0:59:44-0:59:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:59:44):**  So thank you, and let's stay in touch.  
**[0:59:48-0:59:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:59:48):**  As Chris said a little bit earlier as we started, my partner here, I'd like to figure out how  
**[0:59:52-0:59:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:59:52):**  you come on and be a guest with us, Oliver, and maybe teach a course on what you're doing  
**[0:59:56-0:59:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:59:56):**  with natural building.  
**[0:59:58-0:59:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:59:58):**  Hey, let's make it happen.  
**[0:59:59-1:00:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=0:59:59):**  Yeah, I'd love to do that.  
**[1:00:00-1:00:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=1:00:00):**  All right.  
**[1:00:01-1:00:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=1:00:01):**  Well, we'll certainly keep in touch, and I'm sure we can do a follow up sometime in a later  
**[1:00:05-1:00:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=1:00:05):**  season.  
**[1:00:06-1:00:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=1:00:06):**  So again, thank you, Wayne, and I'll talk to you again soon.  
**[1:00:08-1:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=1:00:08):**  Thanks, Oliver.  
**[1:00:09-1:00:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=1:00:09):**  Bye bye, man.  
**[1:00:10-1:00:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=1:00:10):**  Bye bye, everybody.  
**[1:00:11-1:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-dr-wayne-dorband/#t=1:00:11):**  Have a great day.

**[0:00:14-0:00:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:00:14):**  So I know there's a lot of buzz and interest around agroforestry and food forest these  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:00:17):**  days, but do you really know what the difference is between an orchard and a food forest?  
**[0:00:22-0:00:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:00:22):**  Or how to choose the right species for your climate and soil conditions?  
**[0:00:26-0:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:00:26):**  How about companion plants and the various strata of a forest?  
**[0:00:29-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:00:29):**  And if you're looking to make money and sell products, how can you make a business plan  
**[0:00:33-0:00:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:00:33):**  and calculate expenses and profit from a system that could take years to mature?

**[0:02:07-0:02:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:02:07):**  I've often wondered what in the world goes on in the thought process behind the planning  
**[0:02:11-0:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:02:11):**  and design of the newer towns that I've lived in.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:02:14):**  In the cases of really old places, the layout and the architecture always made more sense  
**[0:02:18-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:02:18):**  to me.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:02:19):**  Streets are laid out with orientations to sun patterns or for ease of access to important  
**[0:02:23-0:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:02:23):**  markets or buildings, and the homes reflect the integral relationship between extended  
**[0:02:28-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:02:28):**  family or workers, animals, and even the processing of household goods, and the simple natural  
**[0:02:33-0:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:02:33):**  materials with which much of it is built is integrated with art and gardens and water  
**[0:02:37-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:02:37):**  features which also serve important cultural functions, and in contrast, while modern civic  
**[0:02:42-0:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:02:42):**  planning is very utilitarian, the utility appears to ignore many essential human factors  
**[0:02:48-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:02:48):**  for the ease of machinery and transport.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:02:51):**  In contrast to those older towns, I knew neighbors who would drive to get their mail at the end  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:02:55):**  of the street because there were no walkways, and who spent countless hours maintaining  
**[0:02:59-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:02:59):**  lawns that their children rarely even walked on.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:03:02):**  There were few, if any, gathering spaces or community activity centers, unless you count  
**[0:03:07-0:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:03:07):**  shopping malls or gyms.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:03:09):**  And when you grow up in those environments, they seem pretty normal, but once I got to  
**[0:03:13-0:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:03:13):**  travel and see the contrast of places that were built before cars and concrete and steel,  
**[0:03:18-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:03:18):**  I began to wonder why we ever abandoned that style of building.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:03:21):**  I'm going to put in a disclaimer here that I'm going to stop short of romanticizing  
**[0:03:26-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:03:26):**  the past.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:03:27):**  I've learned enough about history that I don't envy the sanitary or living conditions  
**[0:03:30-0:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:03:30):**  of almost any previous century, nor do I want to gloss over the challenges that these old  
**[0:03:35-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:03:35):**  places are having in integrating with the modern world.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:03:38):**  There are many complex and contextual reasons why these places are both heralded for their  
**[0:03:42-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:03:42):**  picturesque tourist value, while the younger generations flee to find work and opportunities  
**[0:03:47-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:03:47):**  in the new developments.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:03:49):**  And yet, I wanted to gain some insight about why modern towns abandoned some patterns that  
**[0:03:54-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:03:54):**  we know to be more conducive to connected living, and what can be done to retrofit and  
**[0:03:59-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:03:59):**  redesign the infrastructure that we have.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:04:01):**  And for this, I spoke with Charles Morone, professional engineer and land use planner  
**[0:04:06-0:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:04:06):**  with decades of experience.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:04:08):**  Morone is the author of both Strong Towns, A Bottom-Up Revolution to Rebuild American

**[0:04:18-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:04:18):**  He hosts the Strong Towns podcast and is a primary writer for Strong Towns web content,  
**[0:04:23-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:04:23):**  and he has presented Strong Towns concepts in hundreds of cities and towns across North  
**[0:04:28-0:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:04:28):**  America, and Planetizen named him one of the 10 most influential urbanists of all time.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:04:34):**  Now in this interview, we explore the transformation of urban planning over the last few decades,  
**[0:04:39-0:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:04:39):**  and Charles gives vivid examples from well-known studies of major cities around the United  
**[0:04:43-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:04:43):**  States of both the dire consequences of poor planning and the potential of better design.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:04:49):**  We also look into the simple steps that anyone can take to begin to reverse the disconnection  
**[0:04:54-0:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:04:54):**  of their community and begin to create connections and deeper relationships that can set their  
**[0:04:59-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:04:59):**  community on a new trajectory.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:05:01):**  So I'll hand things over now to Charles Morone.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:05:05):**  I'm really interested in how you got started in your interest in civil engineering and  
**[0:05:10-0:05:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:05:10):**  urban planning to begin with.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:05:12):**  Wow.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:05:14):**  I wish I had like a glamorous tale.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:05:17):**  I mean, I was always as a kid interested in cities and how things worked, but I was going  
**[0:05:23-0:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:05:23):**  to be a musician.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:05:24):**  That's what I wanted to do.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:05:26):**  And quite frankly, I had this girlfriend that I really liked.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:05:30):**  She's now my wife.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:05:31):**  She dated all through high school and college, and at one point I just decided I need to  
**[0:05:36-0:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:05:36):**  get serious about life.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:05:37):**  I'm good at math.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:05:40):**  Engineering seemed like an interesting pursuit to me.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:05:43):**  And so I decided that I would not do music.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:05:46):**  I would do engineering.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:05:48):**  And I got my engineering degree.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:05:51):**  As a young engineer, you have to work for a handful of years, four years under another  
**[0:05:57-0:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:05:57):**  engineer before you can get your license.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:05:59):**  And by the time I got my license, I figured out that I was not a very good engineer.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:06:05):**  I mean, I was good.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:06:07):**  I could do the things that you needed to do, but it was the rote part of it was not really  
**[0:06:15-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:06:15):**  a good fit for me.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:06:17):**  And I had been doing a lot of planning work and I realized I wasn't a very good planner  
**[0:06:22-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:06:22):**  either.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:06:23):**  And I thought I could get better if I went and got a graduate degree.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:06:26):**  Fortunately, my wife is very patient with me and she was supportive of that shift.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:06:31):**  So I went back to grad school for a couple of years, got a planning degree.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:06:34):**  And in that process, just wound up starting my own planning firm.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:06:40):**  And so by the time I got out, I had hired a couple of my classmates and was working  
**[0:06:43-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:06:43):**  with cities all over Minnesota doing planning work.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:06:48):**  And I would say like light planning informed engineering work or engineering work that  
**[0:06:54-0:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:06:54):**  was planning that was engineering informed, this merging of left brain and right brain  
**[0:07:00-0:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:07:00):**  kind of stuff.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:07:02):**  I wish it was more glamorous than that.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:07:05):**  I wish I was brought up with this great vision of the world, but really for me, it's been  
**[0:07:11-0:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:07:11):**  trying to answer questions along the way of how do I make my way in this world?  
**[0:07:17-0:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:07:17):**  And then why does this not work the way that it should kind of thing?  
**[0:07:22-0:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:07:22):**  And when did you start to notice that things weren't working as they should?  
**[0:07:25-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:07:25):**  When did you start to see the world that we live in from a more critical standpoint?  
**[0:07:30-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:07:30):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:07:32):**  It's a good question because there's always been flashes.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:07:38):**  Remember as a little kid, I grew up on a farm in central Minnesota and remember as a little  
**[0:07:42-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:07:42):**  kid going to Disney world.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:07:44):**  And I had this very distinct memory of the parade about to start and we're all sitting  
**[0:07:49-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:07:49):**  there on the edge of the street.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:07:50):**  And it's this idealized personification of a place.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:07:55):**  It's not a real place, but for someone who is not really a city person growing up, this  
**[0:08:03-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:08:03):**  was like this magical place.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:08:06):**  That's the whole way it's sold.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:08:07):**  It's the magic kingdom.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:08:08):**  I remember watching the lights come up.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:08:13):**  Like there was a little lever thing that brought the lights up.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:08:17):**  So the lights would shine on the parade.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:08:19):**  And I remember it caught my eye and I thought someone cares enough about this environment  
**[0:08:26-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:08:26):**  to hide those lights when it's not the right time and then to bring them out when it is.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:08:33):**  And it just occurred to me like the attention to detail that that signifies that that creates  
**[0:08:39-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:08:39):**  was just, it was magical to me.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:08:43):**  And as I got older, I had a chance to travel in Italy.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:08:46):**  I had a chance to travel in France and England, the kind of tourist light places that Americans  
**[0:08:55-0:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:08:55):**  go.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:08:56):**  And it did expose me or open my eyes to the idea that there were other ways of assembling  
**[0:09:04-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:09:04):**  things and the logic of it, like the kind of chaotic random logic emergent became very  
**[0:09:13-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:09:13):**  enticing to me and interesting to me, particularly because at the time I was trying to figure  
**[0:09:18-0:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:09:18):**  out how to make the cities I was working with better places.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:09:22):**  I was trying to figure out how to make things work here in an environment where nothing  
**[0:09:30-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:09:30):**  works very well.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:09:31):**  I mean, the US is a really tough place to build cities because of kind of the underlying  
**[0:09:37-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:09:37):**  chassis in which we have built them on.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:09:41):**  And what is that underlying chassis that makes it hard to not only build better communities  
**[0:09:46-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:09:46):**  as you would like to, but also retrofit the ones that already exist?  
**[0:09:52-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:09:52):**  I think it's an oversimplification to say automobile mobility, but I think if you were

**[0:10:02-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:10:02):**  I think if you step back and look at it from a bigger picture, that dichotomy between complexity  
**[0:10:10-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:10:10):**  and complicated, between mechanical and organic is really the thing that we struggle with  
**[0:10:15-0:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:10:15):**  here in the US.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:10:17):**  We place a really high value on mechanical processes.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:10:23):**  How do we create something that functions kind of as a machine that can replicate itself  
**[0:10:28-0:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:10:28):**  over and over and over?  
**[0:10:30-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:10:30):**  The inspiration behind our current development pattern is really growth.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:10:35):**  How do we create a model of development that allows our economy to grow very, very quickly?  
**[0:10:41-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:10:41):**  I'm a pro-growth person.

**[0:11:08-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:11:08):**  If you look at pre-Great Depression American cities, or if you go around the world and

**[0:11:55-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:11:55):**  the kind of post-Great Depression, post-World War II chassis that we build on here.

**[0:12:48-0:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:12:48):**  chosen for other reasons.

**[0:14:03-0:14:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:14:03):**  When a calf died or the rain was going to spoil the hay laying in the field, it became  
**[0:14:08-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:14:08):**  an emergency, not just for us, but for our neighbors and the people around us.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:14:16):**  As I grew older, as I got married and I moved into what would be called just a classic suburban  
**[0:14:22-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:14:22):**  kind of place, I grew up there.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:14:28):**  I was a young adult and spent a deal of time there.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:14:35):**  My neighbors were people that I knew, but that I knew abstractly.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:14:42):**  I'm a friendly guy.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:14:44):**  They were friendly people.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:14:45):**  We would wave to each other when we drove by.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:14:49):**  We would acknowledge each other when we happened to catch each other's eye.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:14:54):**  But I lived in a place for 15 years.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:14:57):**  I couldn't tell you anything about my neighbors.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:15:01):**  I couldn't tell you anything about them, even though in proximity, we were way closer to  
**[0:15:06-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:15:06):**  each other than I was growing up on the farm.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:15:08):**  We were far closer together.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:15:11):**  I remember one day it just dawning on me that my neighbor across the street would literally  
**[0:15:17-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:15:17):**  like as he was driving in, open up his garage door with the garage door opener, drive in.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:15:23):**  And then by the time he was getting out of his car, his garage door would be coming down.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:15:28):**  And it just occurred to me that we have no interaction at all.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:15:33):**  We have zero relationship, even though we live within 50 feet of each other or 60 feet  
**[0:15:38-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:15:38):**  of each other.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:15:40):**  And if my house were to burn down, he would be the guy I would need to go to for help  
**[0:15:45-0:15:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:15:45):**  if I had something, emergency.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:15:48):**  Likewise, if he...  
**[0:15:49-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:15:49):**  There's just not that relationship.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:15:52):**  I live in town now.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:15:53):**  I live in the city.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:15:54):**  So we left the suburban and we came into the heart of the city.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:15:59):**  And we have neighbors right there, like right outside our door, all over the place.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:16:04):**  And it's amazing because I think you could live in this environment and not embrace that  
**[0:16:12-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:16:12):**  neighborhood aspect of it.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:16:13):**  But we've made some intention and it's really not hard because my neighbors are nice, kind  
**[0:16:19-0:16:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:16:19):**  people.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:16:21):**  We don't get along with all of them all the time, they can be annoying.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:16:25):**  But the reality is they are part of our lives, whether we want them to be or not, because  
**[0:16:31-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:16:31):**  we do share a fence line, a front yard, the sounds and the noises and the dogs barking  
**[0:16:43-0:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:16:43):**  and our dogs friends and not friends.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:16:45):**  And we just share all these interactions and you can do that in a way that is really  
**[0:16:50-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:16:50):**  quite beautiful in an urban area that I did find growing up on a farm also happened out  
**[0:16:57-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:16:57):**  of necessity, but in this kind of middle location, this suburban context never happened at all.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:17:05):**  I'm not saying it couldn't happen, but it doesn't happen naturally as a by-product of  
**[0:17:12-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:17:12):**  being in that space.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:17:13):**  Does that make sense?  
**[0:17:15-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:17:15):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:17:16):**  My family is completely in line with my experience growing up partially in the suburbs as well.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:17:21):**  What were the intentions and the steps that you took to reverse what would otherwise be  
**[0:17:26-0:17:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:17:26):**  sort of a default setting of not having interactions with your neighbors?  
**[0:17:34-0:17:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:17:34):**  So my family, I mean, I live in a small town.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:17:37):**  I grew up here.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:17:38):**  I've got family all over the place.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:17:40):**  I have this uncle that is like the personification of the grouchy old, stay off my lawn kind  
**[0:17:46-0:17:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:17:46):**  of person.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:17:48):**  And I remember when we moved here into town, I said, like, I don't want to be my uncle  
**[0:17:52-0:17:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:17:52):**  Rob.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:17:53):**  I don't want to be this crabby old man.  
**[0:17:56-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:17:56):**  And I will admit, my wife and I, my wife grew up on a lake in Minnesota here.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:18:02):**  There's a lot of lakes.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:18:04):**  She grew up on a lake.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:18:05):**  There's a certain amount of privacy you get with that.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:18:09):**  When we lived in the suburban area, there were advantages to it from a privacy standpoint  
**[0:18:16-0:18:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:18:16):**  that obviously when you live in town are not there.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:18:19):**  And my wife in particular, not to throw her under the bus, but was a little bit nervous  
**[0:18:24-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:18:24):**  about giving that up.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:18:27):**  Now we're going to have neighbors like literally, the next house is 15 feet away from ours.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:18:32):**  I mean, we're very, very close.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:18:34):**  So we just with intention, the first day we closed on the house, I went and shook hands  
**[0:18:42-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:18:42):**  with all the neighbors and introduced myself, said, hi, it's amazing how just a little bit  
**[0:18:47-0:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:18:47):**  of smiling will go a long way.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:18:49):**  I found out very quickly that my one neighbor on the one side was like a really generous,  
**[0:18:54-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:18:54):**  man, he's now passed away.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:18:57):**  He was a little bit elderly, but in Minnesota, as you are aware, we get a lot of snow in  
**[0:19:02-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:19:02):**  the winter.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:19:04):**  It is not just etiquette, but it's required that you clear your own sidewalks out in front  
**[0:19:09-0:19:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:19:09):**  of your house within 24 hours of the snow.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:19:12):**  I would get up.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:19:13):**  I'm not a night.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:19:14):**  I'm not a morning person.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:19:15):**  I'm a night person.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:19:16):**  So I would get myself up at eight or nine in the morning and go out to take care of  
**[0:19:21-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:19:21):**  my civic duty.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:19:24):**  And my neighbor had already done it for me because he was just out.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:19:28):**  He was a generous, nice guy.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:19:29):**  He's like, I'm out there.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:19:30):**  I got a snowblower.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:19:31):**  I'm going to do it.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:19:32):**  And we wound up having this race over time to see who could clear the others, who could  
**[0:19:37-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:19:37):**  be the better neighbor, who could clear the other sidewalk more quickly.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:19:41):**  And that kind of attitude is infectious.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:19:44):**  Right?  
**[0:19:45-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:19:45):**  Like once you start doing that and you take some joy and I beat Doug out to clear his  
**[0:19:50-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:19:50):**  sidewalk and I can kind of smile and laugh at him.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:19:53):**  Like, you can't get me, man.  
**[0:19:55-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:19:55):**  I already got your sidewalk.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:19:57):**  All of a sudden it's pretty easy to do the next neighbor's sidewalk and the next neighbor's  
**[0:20:01-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:20:01):**  sidewalk.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:20:02):**  And then pretty soon, you know, we're all kind of enjoying each other's company a little  
**[0:20:07-0:20:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:20:07):**  bit more.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:20:08):**  And then of course I travel a lot for work.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:20:10):**  And so there's times when I'm not home and you know what?  
**[0:20:12-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:20:12):**  It was really nice when Doug would clear my sidewalks when I wasn't home.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:20:15):**  I mean, I would go over and thank him specifically for doing that.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:20:20):**  Again, that those kinds of little gestures and behaviors are just very human.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:20:26):**  They're just very kind, but they also tend to like feedback on themselves and grow.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:20:32):**  This is that Darwinian feedback loop.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:20:35):**  Right?  
**[0:20:36-0:20:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:20:36):**  Darwinian talks a lot about, Darwin does about altruism growing out of natural systems.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:20:42):**  And other people have studied this too to a great degree, how survival of the fittest  
**[0:20:47-0:20:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:20:47):**  really is a short truncated and kind of cruel version of something that actually when looked  
**[0:20:57-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:20:57):**  at in a natural sense is very beautiful because a lot of creatures that exist in nature, and  
**[0:21:03-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:21:03):**  I think we are humans existing in human habitat, have a lot of natural benefit from altruism,  
**[0:21:13-0:21:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:21:13):**  from working together, from helping each other, from being part of an ecosystem or a community  
**[0:21:18-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:21:18):**  where there is sharing.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:21:22):**  I feel very happy to be part of that.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:21:24):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:21:25):**  And not only is that the type of game in which everybody wins, regardless of who comes out  
**[0:21:30-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:21:30):**  on top in the individual match, right?  
**[0:21:34-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:21:34):**  But it also seems, and I can think of a few of my own experiences, that people are kind  
**[0:21:39-0:21:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:21:39):**  of starved for those interactions.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:21:42):**  And if someone just takes that first step, you can often tap into kind of this held back  
**[0:21:49-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:21:49):**  desire or energy to give, to be generous, to contribute and to do things for a collective  
**[0:21:55-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:21:55):**  that maybe just needed that little spark to get going.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:22:00):**  Yes.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:22:02):**  So I don't know what things.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:22:10):**  It's obviously become something that has weighed on people over time and become a huge source  
**[0:22:14-0:22:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:22:14):**  of stress.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:22:15):**  If we transport ourselves back to the early days of the pandemic, which I would call like  
**[0:22:20-0:22:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:22:20):**  the scariest days, right?  
**[0:22:22-0:22:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:22:22):**  Because we didn't know what this was.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:22:25):**  We didn't know the extent of it.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:22:27):**  We knew that it could kill people.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:22:29):**  We knew that it transmitted seemingly quicker than other things we had experienced, Ebola  
**[0:22:34-0:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:22:34):**  being one that, a comparison, and so there was a lot of fear.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:22:41):**  And I think the natural human reaction to fear is to enclose oneself, to lock oneself  
**[0:22:50-0:22:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:22:50):**  in, to kind of hide yourself from this fear.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:22:54):**  And we saw that.  
**[0:22:55-0:23:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:22:55):**  We saw that in the early days, but boy, it did not take much time at all for the beauty  
**[0:23:03-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:23:03):**  of living in a neighborhood with people to start to show itself all up and down my street,  
**[0:23:10-0:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:23:10):**  all throughout my neighborhood, you would see people who would get together.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:23:14):**  This was March and April, which in Minnesota is not always the warmest time sitting out  
**[0:23:20-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:23:20):**  and lawn chairs in the front yard, just 30 feet, 20 feet away from a neighbor, just having  
**[0:23:25-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:23:25):**  a talk across the space, running into so many people where we were out walking and we would  
**[0:23:30-0:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:23:30):**  keep our distance from each other, but just wanted to have that, that interaction.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:23:35):**  And a lot of those interactions were, are you okay?  
**[0:23:38-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:23:38):**  Yeah.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:23:39):**  Are you okay?  
**[0:23:40-0:23:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:23:40):**  Yeah.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:23:41):**  I'm doing fine.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:23:42):**  How are things?  
**[0:23:43-0:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:23:43):**  And as nasty as sometimes this pandemic has become, and here in the U S it's become deeply  
**[0:23:51-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:23:51):**  entwined with the, the team red, the team blue, really partisan politics, as nasty as  
**[0:23:58-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:23:58):**  that has been, there've been some just beautiful human moments that a lot of us have reported  
**[0:24:05-0:24:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:24:05):**  experiencing.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:24:06):**  And I've experienced them in my neighborhood where people wanting that human connection  
**[0:24:12-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:24:12):**  have been able to, to, to seek out ways to make it, to, to, to make it happen that I  
**[0:24:19-0:24:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:24:19):**  don't think living in the old place that I used to, I mean, we never talked to those  
**[0:24:22-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:24:22):**  people in good times.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:24:23):**  Why would we have shatted in a, in the pandemic here?  
**[0:24:27-0:24:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:24:27):**  I feel like it was part of what got us through the worst times.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:24:31):**  Oh, for sure.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:24:32):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:24:33):**  You see those pictures in Italy, right?  
**[0:24:34-0:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:24:34):**  Where the people were, I mean, I remember getting emotional about this because you know,  
**[0:24:38-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:24:38):**  in Italy, they had like the deep lockdown, right?  
**[0:24:41-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:24:41):**  And you get the people who would come to the balcony and sing at night and they would sing  
**[0:24:44-0:24:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:24:44):**  together and there would be this thing.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:24:46):**  And I realized we could nostalgia that and maybe make it something bigger than it was,  
**[0:24:51-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:24:51):**  but I think it was an authentic expression of, of humans wanting to connect.  
**[0:24:57-0:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:24:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:24:58):**  We had the exact same experience here.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:25:00):**  We actually, my partner and I did not leave our apartment for three whole months.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:25:03):**  We didn't even go to the grocery store.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:25:05):**  We stocked up before.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:25:07):**  Wow.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:25:08):**  And at eight o'clock every evening, we would go out onto the terrace and clap for the,  
**[0:25:11-0:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:25:11):**  for the first responders, the medical responders.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:25:14):**  And that was one of the things that kind of brought our little mini neighborhood together.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:25:19):**  And the police would kind of do rounds and, you know, check on people there.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:25:25):**  You know, I mean, those were kind of small things and a lot more has evolved since then,  
**[0:25:29-0:25:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:25:29):**  but to experience it firsthand was a glimmer of hope within that very dark moment.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:25:35):**  And it's that, it's that kind of stuff that really gets you through.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:25:39):**  It's amazing because, you know, I was in the army and when you go and do difficult things,  
**[0:25:45-0:25:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:25:45):**  like that was one of the, you know, as a kid, particularly, that was one of the more difficult  
**[0:25:48-0:25:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:25:48):**  things I did.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:25:50):**  You are thrown into situations with people that you wouldn't normally maybe, you know,  
**[0:25:56-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:25:56):**  in a different situation, be friends with or, or, or be drawn to or attracted to.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:26:01):**  But because you go through this, you know, traumatic or this difficult experience together,  
**[0:26:06-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:26:06):**  I wouldn't call my experience in the military traumatic grading on a curve, but you know,  
**[0:26:11-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:26:11):**  it was for me, it was a, it was a, it was a trying time.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:26:14):**  It's difficult time.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:26:16):**  You feel like this lifelong bond to those people having experienced that.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:26:21):**  And I do right now, I'll say this for me, and I don't know if this is the same for you,  
**[0:26:28-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:26:28):**  but living in time with people in a neighborhood does give you a certain bond to them, but  
**[0:26:35-0:26:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:26:35):**  going through the pandemic with them.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:26:37):**  I mean, I, we had one neighbor turn over during the pandemics.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:26:41):**  We have new people who moved in halfway in between and they've been great.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:26:45):**  It's been nice getting to know them, but the ones that were there at the beginning, I mean,  
**[0:26:49-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:26:49):**  I remember sharing one of them works at the hospital.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:26:51):**  I had a box of N95 masks and I brought them over and they were able to take them to the  
**[0:26:57-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:26:57):**  hospital.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:26:58):**  It's, you know, that wasn't like a super heroic thing on my part, but they needed it at the  
**[0:27:01-0:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:27:01):**  hospital.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:27:02):**  She worked there.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:27:03):**  I knew her because she's my neighbor.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:27:05):**  And it was one of those things that like, I felt good.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:27:07):**  I think she felt good.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:27:09):**  And, and we, I, I I'm feeling like I'm drawing, making this like way more nostalgic than it  
**[0:27:15-0:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:27:15):**  is, but I, it is powerful because we went through this together.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:27:21):**  I do feel a little bit more of a connection to these people.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:27:24):**  And, you know, and that's true when we go through 4th of July celebrations and, and,  
**[0:27:30-0:27:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:27:30):**  you know, Christmas time where everyone decorates their houses and, and all the things we do  
**[0:27:34-0:27:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:27:34):**  in a year, like I think because you do it together with people around you, it does kind  
**[0:27:40-0:27:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:27:40):**  of bind you to them in a way.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:27:42):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:27:43):**  And, you know, there are countless examples of that from certainly the pandemic, but also  
**[0:27:48-0:27:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:27:48):**  before and after.

**[0:27:54-0:27:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:27:54):**  you to pass it on the next time.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:27:56):**  And I'd like to switch gears back again for a moment and focus on something that's quite  
**[0:28:01-0:28:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:28:01):**  the opposite, some of the worst expressions of planning for, for well, for the infrastructure  
**[0:28:08-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:28:08):**  of cities and also the example that you give in your book, strong towns.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:28:13):**  Now you have a chapter on understanding Detroit, which is a city that has become synonymous  
**[0:28:19-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:28:19):**  with urban decay and dereliction, right?  
**[0:28:22-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:28:22):**  My question is what are some of the key takeaways from that example that you used to highlight  
**[0:28:27-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:28:27):**  in that book?  
**[0:28:30-0:28:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:28:30):**  So let me start by saying that I love Detroit.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:28:32):**  I really do.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:28:33):**  I had this perception of Detroit going into it as this place of ruin and abandonment and  
**[0:28:43-0:28:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:28:43):**  decline and decay.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:28:45):**  There certainly is that, like, I'm not going to pretend that that isn't there, but there's  
**[0:28:48-0:28:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:28:48):**  a layer of Detroit too that is very beautiful.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:28:51):**  That is very human, right?  
**[0:28:54-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:28:54):**  I look at Detroit as not some tragic anomaly, but really as the manifestation of that growth  
**[0:29:05-0:29:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:29:05):**  machine that we talked about earlier.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:29:09):**  Detroit was the very first city to experiment with the automobile.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:29:13):**  They were the motor city.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:29:15):**  And if you go back to the pre-auto days in Detroit, Detroit was one of the most beautiful  
**[0:29:21-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:29:21):**  cities in the world.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:29:23):**  The pictures there are just stunning.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:29:25):**  And I've been in buildings like the Detroit Opera House that if you dropped it into Milan  
**[0:29:30-0:29:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:29:30):**  and spruced it up a little bit, would not feel at all out of place.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:29:37):**  It is a mind-blowing, just the chandeliers themselves are mind-blowing, let alone the  
**[0:29:43-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:29:43):**  grandiosity of it.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:29:45):**  That was all in Detroit because Detroit was one of the world's great cities.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:29:50):**  When they started to experiment with the automobile, they were really the first place to develop  
**[0:29:56-0:29:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:29:56):**  the North American development pattern.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:29:59):**  What has become the North American development?  
**[0:30:01-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:30:01):**  They were the first city to say, Henry Ford famously, I want all my employees to be able  
**[0:30:06-0:30:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:30:06):**  to afford my product.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:30:08):**  So I'm going to raise their wages and then finance this thing for them and get them into  
**[0:30:12-0:30:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:30:12):**  it.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:30:13):**  We can talk about the altruism or lack of with that.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:30:17):**  But the idea was in Detroit, we would have this higher standard of living by allowing  
**[0:30:23-0:30:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:30:23):**  people to live outside on larger lots and larger homes.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:30:28):**  In the engineering profession, we say dilution is the solution to pollution.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:30:32):**  If you think about the problems of urban congestion and people living very close to each other,  
**[0:30:40-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:30:40):**  it seemed in the 1920s and 1930s, a very simple solution to just spread people out.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:30:45):**  And the automobile was a great mechanism for that.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:30:49):**  So Detroit experimented with this.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:30:51):**  They were the first ones to run the highways through the middle of the city.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:30:54):**  They were the first ones to tear down neighborhoods, to accommodate commuters and a commuter lifestyle.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:30:59):**  They were the first ones to really devote huge amount of resources to this horizontal  
**[0:31:07-0:31:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:31:07):**  expansion of their place.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:31:10):**  And you can see over time as Detroit has struggled, what it has more than anything else is lacked  
**[0:31:17-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:31:17):**  the capacity to respond.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:31:20):**  One of the very kind of mechanical, again, things of the suburban development model,  
**[0:31:27-0:31:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:31:27):**  the post-war development model is that it generates a lot of cash very quickly for cities,  
**[0:31:33-0:31:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:31:33):**  but it does so in exchange for enormous long-term liabilities.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:31:39):**  I think if you think of Detroit as a case study, you take a city that is this beautiful,  
**[0:31:44-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:31:44):**  gorgeous, very strong place with not perfect, lots of problems, lots of neighborhood tensions,  
**[0:31:51-0:31:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:31:51):**  what have you, but a place that is strong and stable, you spread it out over a huge  
**[0:31:56-0:32:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:31:56):**  area, denuding the tax base, driving up the costs.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:32:00):**  What happens over time is that financially you become insolvent.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:32:05):**  You get the insolvency of Detroit.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:32:07):**  You have more stuff that you have to take care of with a less of an overall tax base.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:32:13):**  The ratio of tax base to obligation gets all out of whack.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:32:20):**  In the early stages of that, the way it manifests is that you have a problem that you can't  
**[0:32:24-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:32:24):**  fix because you don't have the money.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:32:27):**  You don't have the resources.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:32:28):**  You don't have the relationships, the capital, the systems to actually address that.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:32:35):**  And so Detroit's post-war history was one of tremendous boom and then tremendous decline.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:32:44):**  And as the decline started to set in, there was really no way to offset it to the point  
**[0:32:49-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:32:49):**  where you see them getting in all kinds of crazy financial alchemy.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:32:57):**  They got into the modern banking equivalent of the mafia where the hedge funds would come  
**[0:33:04-0:33:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:33:04):**  in and loan them payday loans to make it to next week and to the week after that because  
**[0:33:11-0:33:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:33:11):**  their finances got in this negative spiral.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:33:15):**  To me, the lesson of Detroit is not one of Detroit being a unique place, but one of Detroit  
**[0:33:25-0:33:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:33:25):**  being the early indicator, the canary in the coal mine in a sense, of what the natural  
**[0:33:32-0:33:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:33:32):**  outcome is when you pursue this kind of growth strategy that America has pursued with its  
**[0:33:39-0:33:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:33:39):**  cities.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:33:40):**  Yeah, and there's certainly a lot of other boom and bust urban areas from the industrial  
**[0:33:47-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:33:47):**  age as well.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:33:48):**  I was recently in Manchester, which was the first industrialized city in the world, especially  
**[0:33:54-0:34:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:33:54):**  due to the textile industry, and went through a long period of dereliction as that declined  
**[0:34:01-0:34:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:34:01):**  and have since re...  
**[0:34:03-0:34:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:34:03):**  Again, it's kind of like Detroit.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:34:06):**  They haven't completely come out of that history.

**[0:34:14-0:34:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:34:14):**  but they're starting to find a new identity as new industries come up that feed that center.

**[0:34:26-0:34:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:34:26):**  Because what you're talking about, I think, is fundamentally different, and it's different  
**[0:34:30-0:34:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:34:30):**  in really important ways.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:34:33):**  If we go back to...  
**[0:34:36-0:34:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:34:36):**  Let me give an example that might be a step beyond what you're suggesting, but I think  
**[0:34:41-0:34:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:34:41):**  it will help.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:34:42):**  If we think of the Western boom town, right?  
**[0:34:45-0:34:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:34:45):**  Oh, there's gold in them, there are hills, and everybody shows up and they build the  
**[0:34:48-0:34:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:34:48):**  boom town, and then it booms for a decade, and then it's a ghost town, right?  
**[0:34:54-0:34:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:34:54):**  What do those places look like?  
**[0:34:58-0:35:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:34:58):**  Think of it in your mind, what it looks like.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:35:00):**  There's a main street with a saloon and gunslingers out front.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:35:04):**  I don't know, but we can picture what it looks like, right?  
**[0:35:07-0:35:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:35:07):**  It looks like an old frontier town.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:35:10):**  Around that main street and a couple other blocks, there might be a patchwork of startup  
**[0:35:16-0:35:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:35:16):**  houses or what have you, but there's nothing really beyond that.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:35:21):**  There's certainly no public infrastructure.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:35:24):**  There's no water towers and sewer systems and all that.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:35:28):**  It's like what it would be in a biological sense is like the very early proteins of a  
**[0:35:35-0:35:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:35:35):**  place starting to assemble, right?  
**[0:35:39-0:35:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:35:39):**  And so that boom town basically had no reason to mature to the next level of intensity.  
**[0:35:46-0:35:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:35:46):**  And when the reason for its boom went away, it went away.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:35:50):**  It was in a Darwinian sense like a failed experiment, right?  
**[0:35:54-0:35:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:35:54):**  We use a genetic offshoot, we're going to try this and it didn't work here and so it  
**[0:35:58-0:35:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:35:58):**  goes away.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:35:59):**  And I think we should applaud that.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:36:01):**  We should be fine with that.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:36:03):**  That is something that we don't embrace today at all is this idea of something new starting  
**[0:36:09-0:36:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:36:09):**  and have it fail and go away and that'd be okay.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:36:13):**  When you look at those industrial towns, what you had was largely places that, yes, had  
**[0:36:19-0:36:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:36:19):**  boom town characteristics, but the actual development pattern that they used was in  
**[0:36:25-0:36:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:36:25):**  many ways, this same organic incremental type of system.  
**[0:36:31-0:36:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:36:31):**  And the reason why that that's important is because those places start to generate their  
**[0:36:37-0:36:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:36:37):**  own heat.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:36:38):**  They start to generate their own reason for existing, for living.  
**[0:36:42-0:36:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:36:42):**  And so you can go through a period of time and I think Detroit could have done this where  
**[0:36:46-0:36:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:36:46):**  they became like the boom town manufacturing place and then manufacturing went away.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:36:52):**  But if we look at like Pittsburgh as a different analog, they didn't tear everything down.  
**[0:36:58-0:36:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:36:58):**  They didn't tear down their neighbor.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:36:59):**  There's actually like a place still there.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:37:02):**  And it took them a while to figure out how do we adapt this?  
**[0:37:06-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:37:06):**  How do we make better use of this?  
**[0:37:07-0:37:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:37:07):**  How do we reestablish this?  
**[0:37:10-0:37:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:37:10):**  But the actual bones of a good place, the actual bones of a productive place were still  
**[0:37:15-0:37:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:37:15):**  there.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:37:17):**  And so you could do that.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:37:18):**  You could accomplish that.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:37:19):**  You could overcome that.  
**[0:37:21-0:37:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:37:21):**  When we look at the boom towns that we build today, be it a new suburb or I would say parts  
**[0:37:28-0:37:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:37:28):**  of Silicon Valley or Austin, where we're seeing all kinds of growth now today, I think a lot  
**[0:37:35-0:37:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:37:35):**  of that development pattern, if the boom reason goes away, even though we put enormous investment  
**[0:37:41-0:37:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:37:41):**  into sewer, water, roadway, sidewalks, schools, parks, all this stuff, there isn't enough  
**[0:37:48-0:37:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:37:48):**  there there to actually generate its own heat.  
**[0:37:51-0:37:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:37:51):**  It needs that outside, the thing that is making it boom, whether it's the agglomeration of  
**[0:37:58-0:38:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:37:58):**  high tech or it's a manufacturing place on a good waterway in the industrial age or whatever  
**[0:38:04-0:38:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:38:04):**  it was.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:38:05):**  And when that goes away, I think that all of those places would share similar characteristics  
**[0:38:12-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:38:12):**  and that there would be a natural collapsing back to a viable kind of equilibrium, which  
**[0:38:23-0:38:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:38:23):**  in a place like Austin or the suburban parts of Silicon Valley is going to be really ugly,  
**[0:38:28-0:38:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:38:28):**  just the same way that it's ugly in that ghost town in the American frontier, but different  
**[0:38:35-0:38:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:38:35):**  in a way that say like a Manchester or a place that would have its own heat in a sense, augmenting  
**[0:38:44-0:38:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:38:44):**  and bridging that period of stress.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:38:47):**  Does that make sense?  
**[0:38:49-0:38:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:38:49):**  Yeah, that does make sense.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:38:50):**  That does clear that up.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:38:51):**  And I was actually leading right to where I was going next was, do you see these same  
**[0:38:56-0:39:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:38:56):**  patterns emerging with things like these tech bubbles or the effect of the housing prices  
**[0:39:02-0:39:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:39:02):**  that they cause as well?  
**[0:39:03-0:39:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:39:03):**  Yeah.

**[0:56:34-0:56:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:56:34):**  the snowball effect that start to transform places?  
**[0:56:37-0:56:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:56:37):**  Well, I think there's two big ones that come to mind.  
**[0:56:42-0:56:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:56:42):**  I think the first one is obviously is us.  
**[0:56:50-0:56:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:56:50):**  You read Robert Putnam's Bowling Alone.  
**[0:56:54-0:57:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:56:54):**  He describes a population in isolation from each other.  
**[0:57:00-0:57:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:57:00):**  I think that our default wiring as humans is in many ways to live in isolation with  
**[0:57:08-0:57:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:57:08):**  each other.  
**[0:57:09-0:57:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:57:09):**  I think the greatness of the traditional development pattern is it would nudge us out of our stasis  
**[0:57:15-0:57:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:57:15):**  and in a sense force us to interact with those around us.

**[0:57:28-0:57:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:57:28):**  It's left alone.

**[0:57:59-0:58:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:57:59):**  the federal government and the whole system of the top-down funding of all this stuff,  
**[0:58:11-0:58:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:58:11):**  whether it is the state as the codependent who facilitates all this stuff.  
**[0:58:17-0:58:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:58:17):**  But I think the place where we can have the most changes is the local governments just  
**[0:58:21-0:58:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:58:21):**  being trapped in this system.  
**[0:58:23-0:58:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:58:23):**  When you go to city hall, they will say, we want to make streets safer for the people

**[0:58:33-0:58:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:58:33):**  Why do you have to accommodate 30,000 cars a day?  
**[0:58:36-0:58:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:58:36):**  Well, because that's where the money's coming from and the people who are giving us the  
**[0:58:40-0:58:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:58:40):**  money are saying we have to do.  
**[0:58:42-0:58:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:58:42):**  We want to have organic growth within our neighborhoods.

**[0:58:56-0:59:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:58:56):**  But yeah, we can't do it because, and there's this long list of top-down things they're  
**[0:59:03-0:59:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:59:03):**  responding to.  
**[0:59:05-0:59:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:59:05):**  I think that cities and local leaders need to recognize how much power and authority  
**[0:59:13-0:59:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:59:13):**  they have and they have to be willing.  
**[0:59:18-0:59:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:59:18):**  We always talk about courage and leadership.  
**[0:59:20-0:59:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:59:20):**  I feel like the courage and leadership today is having the courage to say no to the seductive  
**[0:59:26-0:59:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:59:26):**  like quick thing that walks in and having a more long-term bottom-up vision for what  
**[0:59:34-0:59:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:59:34):**  prosperity and success is going to look like.  
**[0:59:37-0:59:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:59:37):**  That's really hard to do when you're in government.  
**[0:59:40-0:59:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:59:40):**  For sure.  
**[0:59:41-0:59:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:59:41):**  Now, it just seems like we keep coming back to this impediment of the transportation infrastructure  
**[0:59:48-0:59:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:59:48):**  and it's one of the things that has really caused the sprawl and the disconnect in the  
**[0:59:53-0:59:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:59:53):**  infrastructure of communities and putting up barriers essentially for people to be able  
**[0:59:59-1:00:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=0:59:59):**  to get to each other and interact on a more human scale.  
**[1:00:03-1:00:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:00:03):**  And of course, in your most recent book, in Confessions of a Recovering Engineer, you  
**[1:00:08-1:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:00:08):**  focus on the role of transportation and transport infrastructure and how it plays into the health  
**[1:00:14-1:00:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:00:14):**  and usability of community spaces.

**[1:00:21-1:00:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:00:21):**  that you see to overhaul it?  
**[1:00:26-1:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:00:26):**  I think if we were to oversimplify, you would say we have had a fetish for a long time with  
**[1:00:33-1:00:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:00:33):**  auto mobility and mobility from a technical standpoint is the speed and volume of traffic  
**[1:00:39-1:00:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:00:39):**  that we move on our streets.  
**[1:00:42-1:00:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:00:42):**  I have this exercise in the first chapter of the book where I go through and explain  
**[1:00:46-1:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:00:46):**  the design process that engineers use to build streets.  
**[1:00:50-1:00:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:00:50):**  And the way they start is with the speed that they're designing for and then the volume  
**[1:00:54-1:00:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:00:54):**  of traffic and everything kind of stems out of that.  
**[1:00:57-1:01:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:00:57):**  Speed and volume equals mobility.  
**[1:01:00-1:01:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:01:00):**  And the theory there is the more mobile people can be in an automobile, the more places they  
**[1:01:05-1:01:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:01:05):**  can reach, the more employment opportunities they have, the more goods they can buy in  
**[1:01:11-1:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:01:11):**  a competitive price and overall the better off our economy will be.  
**[1:01:16-1:01:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:01:16):**  And I want to be generous and go back to the 1950s and recognize that I think to a degree  
**[1:01:23-1:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:01:23):**  that theory is true.  
**[1:01:26-1:01:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:01:26):**  But it's true to a very limited degree because if it's very easy for me to get in my car  
**[1:01:33-1:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:01:33):**  and drive to a place where I can work, where I couldn't have gotten to before, or a place  
**[1:01:38-1:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:01:38):**  where I can buy something at a slightly more affordable price, that does have benefits  
**[1:01:42-1:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:01:42):**  for me today.  
**[1:01:44-1:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:01:44):**  But the trade-off is I can't walk across the street to the grocery store that I used to  
**[1:01:51-1:01:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:01:51):**  go to, or I can't walk two blocks to the restaurant that I used to go to because it's a dangerous  
**[1:01:59-1:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:01:59):**  walk.  
**[1:02:00-1:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:02:00):**  I got to cross a five lane road.  
**[1:02:02-1:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:02:02):**  I've got to walk an extra four blocks that way to get a light to cross.  
**[1:02:06-1:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:02:06):**  I'm taking my life into my own hands.  
**[1:02:10-1:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:02:10):**  It's not socially acceptable.  
**[1:02:12-1:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:02:12):**  There is a component of that, particularly in a small town where it's like, I can't tell  
**[1:02:16-1:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:02:16):**  you, I'm just going to guess I'm in the upper 5% of income earners in my rather poor little  
**[1:02:24-1:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:02:24):**  small town.  
**[1:02:25-1:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:02:25):**  I can't tell you how many times people pull over and say, do you need a ride when I'm  
**[1:02:28-1:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:02:28):**  walking?  
**[1:02:30-1:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:02:30):**  Because like socially, the only people who walk are people who are destitute or need  
**[1:02:33-1:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:02:33):**  a ride.  
**[1:02:35-1:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:02:35):**  So there's all these things that make that two block walk or that four block walk just  
**[1:02:41-1:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:02:41):**  not operable now.  
**[1:02:44-1:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:02:44):**  And it destroys that whole theory of mobility that somehow we'll be better off, that somehow  
**[1:02:49-1:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:02:49):**  we'll have more options, that somehow we'll have a higher prosperity.  
**[1:02:54-1:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:02:54):**  If you go back to the end of World War II in the neighborhood that I live in today,  
**[1:02:58-1:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:02:58):**  there were 13 grocery stores.  
**[1:03:01-1:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:03:01):**  Now, they weren't big box grocery stores.  
**[1:03:04-1:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:03:04):**  They weren't the supermarkets in a sense.  
**[1:03:08-1:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:03:08):**  There was a Norwegian butcher and there was a Finnish pastry place and there was, you  
**[1:03:14-1:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:03:14):**  might have to go to a couple of places to get the stuff you want on a day, but there

**[1:10:47-1:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:10:47):**  They need some mechanical thinking.  
**[1:10:50-1:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:10:50):**  Water flows by gravity.  
**[1:10:52-1:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:10:52):**  That is a...  
**[1:10:53-1:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:10:53):**  No sociologist can wish that away.  
**[1:10:55-1:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:10:55):**  And so there's a certain mechanics to making it work, but the big picture decisions when  
**[1:11:01-1:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:11:01):**  we leave them solely up to mechanical thinking people, we're going to get a just very myopic  
**[1:11:07-1:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:11:07):**  set of responses.  
**[1:11:10-1:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:11:10):**  And what advice do you have for people who perhaps feel trapped in a built world that  
**[1:11:15-1:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:11:15):**  doesn't serve them or their values?  
**[1:11:17-1:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:11:17):**  What are the qualities and the skills perhaps that they can leverage to make a change, even  
**[1:11:21-1:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:11:21):**  if resources are hard to come by?  
**[1:11:27-1:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:11:27):**  We've been having this discussion internally because we have all these local groups that  
**[1:11:32-1:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:11:32):**  have just spawned up by no impetus of our own places that we're strong Sioux Falls,  
**[1:11:38-1:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:11:38):**  we're strong Dallas, we're strong...  
**[1:11:40-1:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:11:40):**  Like where do these places come from?  
**[1:11:41-1:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:11:41):**  And they identify as local strong towns places.  
**[1:11:44-1:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:11:44):**  And so we've been trying to figure out how do we help these places be more effective?  
**[1:11:50-1:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:11:50):**  And there've been a couple of things that have come out of that right away.  
**[1:11:54-1:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:11:54):**  Again, you're asking me something, I am an engineer, I am a planner.  
**[1:11:58-1:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:11:58):**  This is way outside of my area of expertise, but I'll tell you two observations that we  
**[1:12:03-1:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:12:03):**  have.  
**[1:12:04-1:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:12:04):**  The first one is that nobody can do this alone.  
**[1:12:08-1:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:12:08):**  And so if you are going to embark on a project of improving your place, improving the lives  
**[1:12:15-1:12:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:12:15):**  of people around you, addressing some complex issue in your place, you need to join with  
**[1:12:22-1:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:12:22):**  other people.  
**[1:12:23-1:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:12:23):**  You need to find other people who you can build a shared vision with, and that's going  
**[1:12:29-1:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:12:29):**  to require some humility as well as some leadership, right?  
**[1:12:33-1:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:12:33):**  And leadership and humility go hand in hand in this kind of situation.  
**[1:12:37-1:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:12:37):**  The second thing that we have to do that we see as being really effective is you have  
**[1:12:42-1:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:12:42):**  to understand the difference between your circle of concern and your circle of care.  
**[1:12:51-1:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:12:51):**  And this is something that I've seen spoken of in different ways, but I can summarize  
**[1:12:56-1:13:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:12:56):**  it by saying we can be very concerned about Trump and Biden.  
**[1:13:00-1:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:13:00):**  We can be very concerned about the latest thing on Fox News or MSNBC.  
**[1:13:05-1:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:13:05):**  We can be concerned about these things, but if we spend the bulk of our time caring about  
**[1:13:11-1:13:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:13:11):**  them, if that's where we actually put our energy and our hope in, we will be hopelessly  
**[1:13:16-1:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:13:16):**  ineffective.  
**[1:13:17-1:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:13:17):**  We will not get anything done.  
**[1:13:19-1:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:13:19):**  Getting to actually accomplish something requires you to put 95% of your energy into things  
**[1:13:25-1:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:13:25):**  that you can actually have an impact on.  
**[1:13:29-1:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:13:29):**  And that's not to invalidate people's legitimate concerns, but we all know that person.  
**[1:13:35-1:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:13:35):**  And I have dear members of my family where when you sit down to have a conversation with  
**[1:13:41-1:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:13:41):**  them, the first half an hour is just them detoxing from whatever cable news network  
**[1:13:46-1:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:13:46):**  they watch.  
**[1:13:47-1:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:13:47):**  They got to get everything out.  
**[1:13:48-1:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:13:48):**  Have you heard about this?  
**[1:13:49-1:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:13:49):**  Have you heard about that?  
**[1:13:50-1:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:13:50):**  And they got to get through that.  
**[1:13:51-1:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:13:51):**  And then you can actually get to having a conversation with them.  
**[1:13:53-1:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:13:53):**  We have to not be that person, right?  
**[1:13:56-1:14:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:13:56):**  We have to be able to, I'm concerned about this, but I care about this.  
**[1:14:01-1:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:14:01):**  And so the bulk of my mental energy, the bulk of my physical energy, the bulk of my time  
**[1:14:06-1:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:14:06):**  is going to go to the things I care about.  
**[1:14:09-1:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:14:09):**  Not the distraction that people want me to be concerned with.  
**[1:14:15-1:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:14:15):**  Very well said.  
**[1:14:16-1:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:14:16):**  And yeah, I mean, there's so many other places that I would love to go with this.  
**[1:14:21-1:14:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:14:21):**  This could evolve into a whole nother conversation, but perhaps we can leave it for another time.  
**[1:14:26-1:14:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:14:26):**  Charles, can you tell our audience where they can find more of your resources and how they  
**[1:14:30-1:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:14:30):**  can get in touch with you?  
**[1:14:32-1:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:14:32):**  Thank you.  
**[1:14:33-1:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:14:33):**  And we should do, we should do this more.  
**[1:14:34-1:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:14:34):**  You know, I was a little bit apprehensive because I knew you wanted to take this in  
**[1:14:38-1:14:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:14:38):**  places that I am not an expert in.  
**[1:14:41-1:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:14:41):**  And I feel like this has been a good, a good conversation.  
**[1:14:45-1:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:14:45):**  So kudos to you for doing a great interview.  
**[1:14:49-1:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:14:49):**  Strong towns, we publish two, three articles a day.  
**[1:14:52-1:14:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:14:52):**  So strong towns.org is where you can go.

**[1:14:59-1:15:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:14:59):**  Take it, use it.  
**[1:15:00-1:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:15:00):**  We have three different podcast streams.  
**[1:15:02-1:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:15:02):**  We're on every social media platform, just at strong towns or wherever you're at.  
**[1:15:06-1:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:15:06):**  And you'll find us.  
**[1:15:08-1:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:15:08):**  We are doing everything we can to try to share this core message of financial resiliency  
**[1:15:13-1:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:15:13):**  and how we build great places with as many people as we can.  
**[1:15:17-1:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:15:17):**  So I just want to thank you for the opportunity to be able to come and share ideas with people.  
**[1:15:21-1:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:15:21):**  This is, this is what we do.  
**[1:15:23-1:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:15:23):**  And I, I, I am just again, humbled by what people take and do with it.  
**[1:15:29-1:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-marohn-on-the-keys-to-designing-strong-and-resilient-towns/#t=1:15:29):**  It's really incredible.

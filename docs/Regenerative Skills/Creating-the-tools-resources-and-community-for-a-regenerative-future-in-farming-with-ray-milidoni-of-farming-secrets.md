**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:00:09):**  You're in the right place for all things regenerative living, ecological restoration,  
**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:00:14):**  permaculture and natural building.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:00:16):**  I'm your host Oliver Gaucher.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:00:18):**  In this show, it's my job to interview leaders, innovators and rebels on the cutting edge  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:00:22):**  of their fields as we look for solutions to our generation's most urgent challenges  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:00:27):**  and share these techniques and information so that you can join us in creating a healthy  
**[0:00:31-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:00:31):**  and abundant world for everyone.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:00:33):**  So let's get started.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:00:40):**  Get the Essentials.  
**[0:00:42-0:00:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:00:42):**  Written by the world's leading sustainable builders, designers and engineers, New Society

**[0:01:10-0:01:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:01:10):**  Find out more about the Sustainable Building Essentials Series at newsociety.com.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:01:17):**  Without a doubt, the most important mission of our lifetimes will be regenerating this  
**[0:01:21-0:01:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:01:21):**  planet and creating a new culture based on care and stewardship for all life.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:01:27):**  But it can be hard to know where to start.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:01:29):**  After more than 150 episodes of speaking to leaders and innovators in the regenerative  
**[0:01:34-0:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:01:34):**  fields around the world, and working with clients and organizations to help them reach  
**[0:01:38-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:01:38):**  their regenerative goals, I've compiled many lists of essential skills and steps that  
**[0:01:42-0:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:01:42):**  anyone can take today to begin their journey towards a brighter future for themselves,  
**[0:01:47-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:01:47):**  their families and communities, and for the ecosystems that support them.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:01:51):**  Every Monday, to get your week started off right, I'll send you a new regenerative

**[0:01:59-0:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:01:59):**  What's more is that I'm creating a community of skill builders like you who are sharing  
**[0:02:03-0:02:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:02:03):**  their results and stories of success to inspire you towards greater action.

**[0:02:13-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:02:13):**  Start your week off right by building your skills for a regenerative future.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:02:19):**  Though regenerative agriculture has made huge leaps forward in the last decade, it still  
**[0:02:23-0:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:02:23):**  only accounts for a very small percentage of the farms around the world and even less  
**[0:02:27-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:02:27):**  in overdeveloped countries.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:02:29):**  Now while we still have a long way to go to make ecological land management practices  
**[0:02:33-0:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:02:33):**  the norm around the world, there are a lot of people dedicated to accelerating the progress  
**[0:02:37-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:02:37):**  of recent years by creating educational platforms, mentorship programs, and community collaboration  
**[0:02:43-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:02:43):**  around these important skills.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:02:46):**  In this episode, I got to speak to one of my favorite new contacts in regenerative farming  
**[0:02:50-0:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:02:50):**  education, Ray Miledani from Melbourne, who works with Farming Secrets, one of the premier  
**[0:02:54-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:02:54):**  educational platforms for profitable regenerative farming based in Australia.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:03:00):**  Ray states that his mission is to create a community which inspires moments of collaboration  
**[0:03:05-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:03:05):**  where we can all learn new ways of thinking by promoting environmental awareness.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:03:10):**  In this interview, Ray talks about the patterns and commonalities in the successful regenerative  
**[0:03:14-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:03:14):**  farming network that he works with, and the power to create change at the societal level  
**[0:03:19-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:03:19):**  through inspiring education and new ways of thinking.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:03:22):**  We also look into some of the biggest roadblocks that are holding the ecological farming movement  
**[0:03:27-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:03:27):**  back, and how our generation holds the power to transform our food system by supporting  
**[0:03:32-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:03:32):**  and promoting the growers who are creating a new way of farming by collaborating with,  
**[0:03:36-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:03:36):**  rather than fighting nature.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:03:38):**  So with that said, I'll hand things over now to Ray.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:03:41):**  Hey Ray, thanks so much for taking the time to be with me today.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:03:45):**  How are you doing?  
**[0:03:46-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:03:46):**  I'm great, thanks a lot.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:03:47):**  Well look, we've got so much to cover when it comes to regenerative farming and all that  
**[0:03:52-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:03:52):**  you've learned through your work with Farming Secrets about the commonalities between ecological  
**[0:03:57-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:03:57):**  practices in tons of places around the world.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:04:00):**  So what do you say we just get down to the questions?  
**[0:04:02-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:04:02):**  Absolutely, let's jump straight into it.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:04:03):**  I love talking about this topic, so let's do it.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:04:06):**  Marvelous.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:04:07):**  So before we get too deep into these topics, why don't you tell our listeners a little  
**[0:04:12-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:04:12):**  about your personal background and how you came to work for Farming Secrets.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:04:16):**  Yeah, awesome.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:04:17):**  So my background really has just been to be a human being of the planet that's always  
**[0:04:22-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:04:22):**  curious to how things work.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:04:25):**  And so from a very young age, I won't give you the long story, but all my family stopped  
**[0:04:30-0:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:04:30):**  buying me toys because every time I'd get them, I'd break them because I wanted to know  
**[0:04:34-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:04:34):**  how they work.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:04:35):**  And my curious mind has always been there and I always want to know the why and the  
**[0:04:40-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:04:40):**  how.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:04:41):**  And I went down the business and marketing education part of my degrees and so forth  
**[0:04:47-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:04:47):**  and really wanted to get a bigger understanding of how humans and of the planet really buy  
**[0:04:53-0:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:04:53):**  things and interact with each other.  
**[0:04:55-0:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:04:55):**  And that took a real big interest for me and I love solving problems.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:04:59):**  I set up a few different businesses.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:05:02):**  I have a bit of an entrepreneurial mind and I want to solve problems in a good, efficient  
**[0:05:07-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:05:07):**  way.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:05:08):**  And I was working at an online education company doing courses and Farming Secrets came into  
**[0:05:16-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:05:16):**  my ecosystem and we kind of just hit it off from the bat.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:05:20):**  So Helen and Hugo set up Farming Secrets nearly 13 years ago now and they've been in the ag  
**[0:05:25-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:05:25):**  space for longer than that.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:05:28):**  And we just kind of vibed it off and when we were talking, it was like, oh, me too.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:05:32):**  And yeah, that's what's really passionate for me and these are my values.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:05:36):**  And we just started working more and more together.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:05:39):**  And I really started with Farming Secrets as a bit of a helping hand, giving some marketing  
**[0:05:45-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:05:45):**  advice and working on some promotions together.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:05:48):**  And it was almost like a bit of an affiliate, like, let's do this promo together and I'll  
**[0:05:52-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:05:52):**  take a little bit of a clipping on the side in exchange of hours for work and so forth.  
**[0:05:57-0:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:05:57):**  And then the relationship grew from that.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:05:59):**  I became a lot more interested in the impact that Farming Secrets was having with farmers  
**[0:06:04-0:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:06:04):**  and the planet and all the benefits that comes with Regen Ag.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:06:09):**  And I got really, really ingrained with it.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:06:12):**  And I again, I became very curious.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:06:14):**  I dug deeper.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:06:15):**  I watched a lot of videos and educated myself and audio books and kind of got to that point  
**[0:06:22-0:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:06:22):**  where it's like, this is something I want to go deeper in.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:06:26):**  And I had a few different marketing clients at that point.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:06:28):**  And I decided to say goodbye to some of my other clients and go all in with Farming Secrets.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:06:35):**  And we're now at a point of basically setting myself up as the succession plan from Helen  
**[0:06:42-0:06:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:06:42):**  and Hugo and how I can bring the business and all the knowledge that's been captured  
**[0:06:47-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:06:47):**  over the years to the new generation of farmers and keep the business legacy going beyond.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:06:53):**  Well, that's super exciting, but it must be daunting.  
**[0:06:57-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:06:57):**  That's no small task.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:06:58):**  There's such a body of work behind Farming Secrets and their contact network and their  
**[0:07:03-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:07:03):**  educational platform.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:07:05):**  You've got quite a bit of work ahead of you.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:07:08):**  I do.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:07:09):**  I do.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:07:10):**  I love a big challenge and I love to bite off more than what I can chew.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:07:12):**  I just tend to chew faster.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:07:15):**  It's a good space to be in.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:07:16):**  And it's really easy when it aligns with your values.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:07:19):**  And there's a real sense of fulfillment and work of impact that's being completed each  
**[0:07:26-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:07:26):**  day.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:07:27):**  And of course, like with anything in life, it goes up and down and we have our moments.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:07:30):**  But in the most times, it's really rewarding to hear the success stories and really getting  
**[0:07:37-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:07:37):**  that insight.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:07:38):**  And we'll probably cover this a little bit more later on.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:07:40):**  But Farming Secrets have been doing and capturing information for the last 13 years.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:07:45):**  And there's kind of this tipping point that's happening now where people are starting to  
**[0:07:48-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:07:48):**  identify as regenerative farming practices or holistic management.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:07:55):**  And now there's people putting their hands up and saying, I want to identify as a farmer  
**[0:08:00-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:08:00):**  that is this way, where for the last 13 years, Farming Secrets has really kind of struggled  
**[0:08:05-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:08:05):**  with getting people to realize that this is a way of farming that is more profitable.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:08:10):**  And the great news is that we have case studies from people who started 10 years ago who have  
**[0:08:16-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:08:16):**  gotten so much results that they now are part of the expert network and are also now educated  
**[0:08:23-0:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:08:23):**  to share this.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:08:24):**  Man, that's really exciting.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:08:25):**  And along those lines, let's start to sort of unpack a lot of the broad strokes of what  
**[0:08:32-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:08:32):**  has been learned in this 13 years of investigation.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:08:35):**  And now that it's starting to become more of a movement and gain traction, and like  
**[0:08:40-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:08:40):**  you said, people are starting to embrace it and want to be identified with it.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:08:45):**  Let's figure out exactly what we're talking about and some of the commonalities between  
**[0:08:50-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:08:50):**  farming systems around the world that you and the founders have found that really work.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:08:58):**  And so we're talking here about the systems that are kind of diverging from what we consider  
**[0:09:04-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:09:04):**  as conventional or industrial agriculture and are working with nature in order to create  
**[0:09:10-0:09:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:09:10):**  the abundance and the yields and the profits that are needed to maintain a good farming  
**[0:09:16-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:09:16):**  business.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:09:19):**  And I just want to really stress on the fact that it's not so much the tactics.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:09:27):**  Everyone always wants to know how it's all done and the nuts and bolts.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:09:31):**  And that's definitely really a key point, but it really starts on a deeper level.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:09:36):**  And I think what's really starting to happen now is that people are getting to a point  
**[0:09:41-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:09:41):**  where they've gone, enough is enough.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:09:43):**  And they're starting to really see and feel the evidence that we are driving our systems  
**[0:09:50-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:09:50):**  into the ground and that resources are starting to run out.  
**[0:09:54-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:09:54):**  There are wild storms.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:09:56):**  There is people eating and they're still hungry because they're not nourished.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:10:02):**  And we're all getting to this point where we're questioning what we're being told or  
**[0:10:07-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:10:07):**  who's done the research.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:10:12):**  And we have access to information, which never really happened in a lot of generations beforehand.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:10:18):**  You would get told some information, you'd take it for face value.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:10:22):**  But now we hear something, and this is why I love the way that my brain questions everything  
**[0:10:27-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:10:27):**  and wants to be curious.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:10:29):**  We go and do our own research.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:10:31):**  And yes, it's the internet and everyone can put up whatever they want.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:10:34):**  But what we're starting to see now is so many results of people doing, you know, we talk  
**[0:10:41-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:10:41):**  about this new way of farming and branching off from conventional, but in a really weird  
**[0:10:45-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:10:45):**  roundabout way, we're actually going back to the way that it used to be done.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:10:49):**  And this is, you know, kind of more of a traditional, natural, holistic way that mother nature intended  
**[0:10:56-0:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:10:56):**  the food system to work on.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:10:58):**  And so, you know, there's this system that kind of got implanted into the human race  
**[0:11:01-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:11:01):**  of how farming should be that was influenced by machinery and the Industrial Revolution  
**[0:11:07-0:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:11:07):**  and the ability to take a magic pill or put an input onto the land and have some miracle  
**[0:11:14-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:11:14):**  growth.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:11:15):**  And while those reports and statistics are correct, because that's exactly what happened,  
**[0:11:20-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:11:20):**  we get into a point now where that is starting to break and run out.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:11:24):**  And there's a lot of research where it says, you know, there is only probably another,  
**[0:11:29-0:11:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:11:29):**  you know, 60 cycles of, you know, 60 or so cycles of food that can be produced from the  
**[0:11:36-0:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:11:36):**  land that we have, because it's just becoming more and more depleted.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:11:40):**  And we're having to modify seeds to cope with these chemical inputs.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:11:45):**  And we all just kind of go in, really, I'm not sure if this is what I want to be consuming.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:11:51):**  And let me do my own research and let me grow my own food.  
**[0:11:55-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:11:55):**  And then all of a sudden, there's this realisation of, wow, this tomato does not taste like the  
**[0:12:00-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:12:00):**  tomato I used to eat.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:12:03):**  And you know, there's a lot of, you know, there's a lot of things happening in the planet  
**[0:12:08-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:12:08):**  with a lot of people wanting to, you know, live smaller and the tiny house movement,  
**[0:12:12-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:12:12):**  people want to live, you know, with less things and the minimalistic movement.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:12:15):**  We're kind of going back to, you know, traditional ways of things being done where we just happy  
**[0:12:20-0:12:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:12:20):**  and content with less.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:12:22):**  And the food system being less complicated is definitely something that a lot of humans  
**[0:12:26-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:12:26):**  are feeling like needs to be repaired.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:12:31):**  And we, you know, and it's not something that's broken.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:12:33):**  So it's not something that we need to change because it used to work.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:12:37):**  It just needs to be repaired back to the way it used to be, where maybe we need to grow  
**[0:12:41-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:12:41):**  food, you know, in our own backyards, in our own local villages and community gardens.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:12:47):**  And we're starting to see an abundance of that.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:12:50):**  People are replanting public spaces with fruit trees.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:12:53):**  So that way people can pick fruit and eat and go foraging.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:12:57):**  You know, those are all really great movements that even now councils are starting to support.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:13:02):**  I couldn't agree more.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:13:04):**  And I think that observation is really important that it is more of a mindset than any of the  
**[0:13:08-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:13:08):**  techniques specifically.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:13:10):**  And so to get back to that question, would you say that the commonalities really are  
**[0:13:14-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:13:14):**  a change in mindset of the practitioners of the farmers themselves?  
**[0:13:18-0:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:13:18):**  Or taking sort of a, I wouldn't say an alternative approach because it really is an original  
**[0:13:23-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:13:23):**  one to looking at yield and profit as so much more than money or quantity, but rather a  
**[0:13:31-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:13:31):**  holistic idea of health for all the life forms that are kind of within their management on  
**[0:13:37-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:13:37):**  their site?  
**[0:13:38-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:13:38):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:13:39):**  And I think it is definitely a mindset thing because unfortunately, you know, we speak  
**[0:13:45-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:13:45):**  to a lot of farmers every day and one of the things that keeps coming up is, well, this  
**[0:13:51-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:13:51):**  is the way that we've always done it.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:13:53):**  And what we're forgetting to realize is that's what you realize is happening as a farmer  
**[0:13:58-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:13:58):**  with the generations that you know were alive to teach you.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:14:02):**  It's not the way that it was always done.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:14:05):**  And you know, some traditions stay in families for a long time, other traditions kind of  
**[0:14:10-0:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:14:10):**  fade away.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:14:12):**  And so just opening up people's minds to realize that there is a different way.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:14:17):**  And I'm not saying it's a better way because sometimes it could be not the right thing  
**[0:14:21-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:14:21):**  for that farmer.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:14:22):**  And with Farming Secrets, we definitely take this approach where every new farmer we work  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:14:28):**  with gets onboarded to know what their outcomes and situations are because there are so many  
**[0:14:33-0:14:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:14:33):**  environmental factors when it comes to farming.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:14:36):**  And we never claim to be the experts to know everyone.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:14:39):**  We kind of refer to ourselves as the glue.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:14:41):**  We just know who we can point you in the direction to help you with the outcome that you're looking  
**[0:14:46-0:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:14:46):**  to achieve.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:14:48):**  And some of the new terminologies that we're trying to encourage farmers to look at is,  
**[0:14:53-0:14:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:14:53):**  you know, profit per acre.  
**[0:14:55-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:14:55):**  And so you take a lot of, you know, Joel Sullivan's work where he stacks enterprises on top of  
**[0:15:01-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:15:01):**  his farms.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:15:02):**  It's no longer just about growing one monoculture type of food or product or fiber or resource.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:15:08):**  It's about, you know, stacking other enterprises on top of that to increase your profits per  
**[0:15:14-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:15:14):**  acre, which means that farmers can now start thinking they can reduce their land and make  
**[0:15:20-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:15:20):**  more money.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:15:21):**  You reduce their overheads and make more money.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:15:24):**  And for some farmers, it's not even about the money.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:15:27):**  I love a case like a case study or an experience that happened with us at a field day recently  
**[0:15:32-0:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:15:32):**  where the husband and wife were selling the farm and they were putting all their plans  
**[0:15:37-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:15:37):**  together to sell the farm out of the family.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:15:41):**  And they had everything really ready to go up, to go.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:15:45):**  And then the kids came back for Christmas and went, we've heard about this regenerative  
**[0:15:49-0:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:15:49):**  farming and we're really intrigued that we can leave the planet a better place than we've  
**[0:15:53-0:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:15:53):**  found it.  
**[0:15:54-0:16:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:15:54):**  And mum and dad, if you make the farm regenerative, we will take the farm over.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:16:00):**  And so the parents threw the plans of succession and handing the farm over to a stranger or  
**[0:16:05-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:16:05):**  an investor in the bin and went out to work to return their farm in a regenerative way  
**[0:16:10-0:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:16:10):**  because the kids were more interested in leaving that parcel of land better than the way that  
**[0:16:15-0:16:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:16:15):**  they found it.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:16:16):**  And so it's not about money.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:16:18):**  It's not about profit.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:16:20):**  It's not about yield.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:16:21):**  It's about the impact and the why and the purpose and the meaningfulness that that farmer  
**[0:16:27-0:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:16:27):**  could leave as their impact on the planet.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:16:29):**  And that's a different way of thinking about it.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:16:33):**  And you go, well, if we grow really great food and it's nutritionist, you know, nutritional,  
**[0:16:38-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:16:38):**  and it has great results.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:16:40):**  And if that fails, we're putting carbon back into the soil and we're leaving the planet  
**[0:16:45-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:16:45):**  better.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:16:46):**  And so that's a great win, even if it is a ruined crop or a bad year.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:16:52):**  You know, there is no bad years when the saving the planet becomes the why and the purpose.  
**[0:16:57-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:16:57):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:16:58):**  Yeah, it gives an entirely different framework, looking at what your objectives are.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:17:02):**  It's not just a matter of putting out products and, you know, getting things done within  
**[0:17:08-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:17:08):**  a timeframe or whatever metrics, you know, that have kind of governed the way that massive  
**[0:17:13-0:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:17:13):**  farm enterprises have have kind of moved on and reframes it into something that is, I  
**[0:17:21-0:17:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:17:21):**  guess, larger than a single generation and looks at a timeframe that affects so many  
**[0:17:28-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:17:28):**  people and generations down the line as well.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:17:32):**  So with this shift in mindset, let's start first about like, how did we get here?  
**[0:17:38-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:17:38):**  You touched on this a little bit earlier about how sort of large vested interests, little  
**[0:17:43-0:17:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:17:43):**  after World War Two, started to convince farmers that large machinery and chemicals were the  
**[0:17:48-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:17:48):**  only way to manage their land.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:17:51):**  How was that able to be effective when farming had sort of followed this sort of tradition  
**[0:17:57-0:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:17:57):**  of multi enterprises and working with the ecosystem up until that point?  
**[0:18:03-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:18:03):**  Yeah, so I think it's a few different systems working together.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:18:07):**  I think, you know, I don't want to call out any, you know, any one or, you know, any particular  
**[0:18:12-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:18:12):**  group, but it's a lot of systems working together.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:18:16):**  It's population growth, you know, how do we feed, you know, how do we feed more people?  
**[0:18:21-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:18:21):**  And that's the problem everyone tried to solve, not how do we make more nutrient dense food?  
**[0:18:27-0:18:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:18:27):**  So humans can eat less, you know, this whole, you know, I call it BS in regards to having  
**[0:18:34-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:18:34):**  to eat four meals a day, you know, six meals a day and big grazers and all that.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:18:38):**  I really question whether that's actually necessary, or whether that's corporate research  
**[0:18:42-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:18:42):**  that says buy more, consume more, you know, and, you know, there's so many, you know,  
**[0:18:48-0:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:18:48):**  there's marketing, you know, marketing is to convince you that you need bigger, better,  
**[0:18:52-0:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:18:52):**  faster, shinier, and more of it.  
**[0:18:55-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:18:55):**  And so that puts the wrong pressure on the system that then goes, well, we don't, we  
**[0:19:00-0:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:19:00):**  don't grow enough.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:19:01):**  So then the research is, well, how do we grow more?  
**[0:19:03-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:19:03):**  And then the research goes out to solve that problem.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:19:08):**  And, you know, the science hypothesis is always defined at the start of research.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:19:14):**  And so it's very easy to pull in all the data that supports that argument that if we input  
**[0:19:20-0:19:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:19:20):**  this or we do this, we farm this way, that it will yield to two more.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:19:25):**  And that might be true in a controlled environment.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:19:28):**  But then there's environmental factors that matter.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:19:31):**  There's climate, there's floods, there's drought, there's, you know, frost, there's so many  
**[0:19:35-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:19:35):**  different things that can change the outcome of that yield.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:19:39):**  And then you go back to the experts.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:19:43):**  And they say, well, you are low on this, so put this in.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:19:48):**  And the system is designed to machine more, which consumes more fuel that's driven by  
**[0:19:55-0:20:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:19:55):**  the, you know, that resource hungry industry that then says, input this because you're  
**[0:20:03-0:20:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:20:03):**  low on that, which then causes another problem because it takes out an animal out of the  
**[0:20:08-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:20:08):**  ecosystem or the bees start disappearing.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:20:11):**  So there's no pollinators.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:20:13):**  And it's a ripple effect.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:20:14):**  And then it's kind of like going to the doctors and say, I've got a pain in my shoulder.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:20:18):**  And they give you a pill.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:20:19):**  But then that pill gives you a stomach ache.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:20:22):**  So then there's another pill to solve the stomach ache.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:20:24):**  But then that makes you feel dizzy.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:20:25):**  So then you take another pill not to be dizzy.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:20:27):**  All of a sudden you're on three pills.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:20:29):**  And we've forgotten that the original problem was the shoulder.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:20:33):**  And the food system works exactly the same.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:20:38):**  It's the effect and the problem that kind of one thing leads to another to another.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:20:43):**  And then originally we forget what was the original problem we're trying to solve.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:20:47):**  And that's what I think we're at now where everyone's looking back going, well, hang  
**[0:20:50-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:20:50):**  on a minute.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:20:51):**  Why don't we just eat less?  
**[0:20:53-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:20:53):**  As humans, we are living in a world of abundance.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:20:56):**  You can now go through a drive through and get a very high calorie meal that you're not  
**[0:21:00-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:21:00):**  even hungry.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:21:01):**  You're just eating because, oh, it's lunchtime because someone told you that you have to  
**[0:21:05-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:21:05):**  eat between 12 and one.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:21:07):**  There is no understanding of the sun and the cycles and anything like that.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:21:11):**  The moon, we're not eating as the way we used to when we used to feel hungry.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:21:16):**  We don't go through feast and famine like we used to.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:21:19):**  And so we are in a system that just relies on us to consume and eat more.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:21:25):**  And there's a lot of evidence that shows that we need that, but there's also probably a  
**[0:21:31-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:21:31):**  lot of research that needs to be done that proves that we don't need that, which that's  
**[0:21:34-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:21:34):**  not what's being funded.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:21:36):**  When I really like what you mentioned how there are so many other ways of seeing the  
**[0:21:40-0:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:21:40):**  consequences of this mentality, even away from farming, like through the healthcare  
**[0:21:45-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:21:45):**  system, through the way that we eat, certainly the way that we work, how it's regimented  
**[0:21:49-0:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:21:49):**  by industry rather than necessarily the work that needs to get done.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:21:54):**  We seem to be in a time of upheaval of all of these ideas that have been entrenched in  
**[0:21:59-0:22:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:21:59):**  our culture for a relatively very short period of time, but in that time have become ubiquitous  
**[0:22:06-0:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:22:06):**  and stabilized.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:22:11):**  And so with this rethinking of the structure of how we do things and what the motivations  
**[0:22:17-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:22:17):**  are behind them, where do you see some of the conclusions coming out that lead people  
**[0:22:23-0:22:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:22:23):**  into rethinking their management practices of their land?  
**[0:22:27-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:22:27):**  Yeah, I think we're in a really interesting space now because obviously, not to put a  
**[0:22:34-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:22:34):**  time onto this interview, but we've just gone through COVID and we've gone through a lot  
**[0:22:38-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:22:38):**  of riots that are happening around the world and protests.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:22:42):**  And we're at a point now where we just feel like something's not working and we're not  
**[0:22:48-0:22:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:22:48):**  trusting our news source, we're not trusting our feeds anymore.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:22:53):**  We're really questioning everything.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:22:57):**  But one thing that has really stood out is that a lot of Australians, because obviously  
**[0:23:01-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:23:01):**  I'm an Australian, I see a lot of the inputs that are happening in Australia, is that a  
**[0:23:06-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:23:06):**  lot of Australians are really going, hang on a minute, we got taught a history at school  
**[0:23:10-0:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:23:10):**  that doesn't actually match the history that was.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:23:13):**  And so now with the access of information, let me go and learn and a big, like all the  
**[0:23:17-0:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:23:17):**  top selling books and podcasts and audio books at the moment are all books about the Aboriginal  
**[0:23:24-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:23:24):**  movement and the traditional land owners.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:23:27):**  And one thing that really stands out for me is that they observed the land.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:23:31):**  They were really good or great at observing and really knowing what needed to happen,  
**[0:23:38-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:23:38):**  where and what.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:23:39):**  And what we've lost is that ability to observe our farms and analyse it from a holistic point  
**[0:23:46-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:23:46):**  of view and go, this paddock needs this, this area requires this.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:23:52):**  And over here, I'm going to do this experiment to just fulfil my own curiosity.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:23:57):**  And so we treat it like a one size fits all.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:24:01):**  We go, the entire area requires this type of treatment.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:24:06):**  And that causes a lot of problems.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:24:08):**  And so what I feel like we really need to do is just slow down and just look and watch.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:24:15):**  And a lot of people in this space, and Gay Brown mentions this in his book, Nicole Masters  
**[0:24:23-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:24:23):**  refers to this in her book as well, that we just need to really have those broad ideas  
**[0:24:29-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:24:29):**  when we stop, walk away from the farm and watch what's happening.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:24:35):**  And that's what I really feel like farmers are missing is because they're chasing the  
**[0:24:40-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:24:40):**  next yield.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:24:41):**  They're never giving their farm the ability to stop and just have a bit of a respite and  
**[0:24:45-0:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:24:45):**  not only their farm, but themselves, their own mind, their own spirit to be more connected  
**[0:24:52-0:24:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:24:52):**  and just observe the wildlife, observe the animals and realise that the ecosystem is  
**[0:24:56-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:24:56):**  missing crucial creatures and not just above ground, but really below the ground.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:25:03):**  You know, my kind of learnings and advice that I give to farmers a lot these days is,  
**[0:25:10-0:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:25:10):**  you know, we all look at the livestock that's above the ground, but there's more livestock  
**[0:25:14-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:25:14):**  below the ground that we don't even consider.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:25:16):**  And below ground tells us more about how things are working above ground.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:25:22):**  So instead of trying to fix the problem above the ground, let's go below the ground and  
**[0:25:26-0:25:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:25:26):**  see what the readings are of your soil and all the microbes and analyse that and learn  
**[0:25:33-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:25:33):**  how to read those kind of triggers to fix everything that we can actually see.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:25:39):**  And like we were talking about in the beginning with the commonalities, that's one of the  
**[0:25:43-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:25:43):**  most prominent ones that I've heard throughout the interviews that I've done in this series  
**[0:25:47-0:25:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:25:47):**  on regenerative agriculture is that once we start to pull things out of balance from the  
**[0:25:53-0:25:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:25:53):**  way that a healthy ecosystem should be, when we start to remove, you know, specific change  
**[0:25:59-0:26:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:25:59):**  agents, whether they're predators, whether they're microbes in the soil, whether they're  
**[0:26:04-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:26:04):**  herbivores, or whatever the natural system was being maintained as before we started  
**[0:26:09-0:26:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:26:09):**  to alter it, we then have to supplement that work or that presence with some sort of artificial,  
**[0:26:16-0:26:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:26:16):**  I guess, change maker, whether it's machinery, whether it's fertilisers, whether it's irrigation  
**[0:26:22-0:26:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:26:22):**  or any of these other things that are considered essential for modern farming.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:26:27):**  I mean, when we think about it, all of those services were performed by the ecosystem before  
**[0:26:32-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:26:32):**  we started to pull it out of balance.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:26:34):**  And the beauty in this that I've really heard from a lot of people is that when you start  
**[0:26:40-0:26:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:26:40):**  to put the pieces back together and reestablish balance and order, you don't have to be a  
**[0:26:46-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:26:46):**  specialist in everything.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:26:47):**  You don't have to know the exact nutrient ratios to grow this crop or any of these other  
**[0:26:55-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:26:55):**  metrics that we go into so much detail in in scientific research.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:27:01):**  You can leave it in the hands of the life forms that were specialised at doing those  
**[0:27:06-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:27:06):**  things just by reestablishing that order.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:27:10):**  I absolutely agree that if we just leave it in the hands of Mother Nature, like all the  
**[0:27:14-0:27:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:27:14):**  rainforests around the world have no one tilling it, have no one putting any inputs into the  
**[0:27:19-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:27:19):**  rainfalls, and yet they're lush and grow like crazy.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:27:23):**  And I understand that we can't bring that into the farming system.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:27:27):**  However, we definitely just need to learn a lot from that and go, well, Mother Nature  
**[0:27:31-0:27:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:27:31):**  had a system or has a system that works for us.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:27:35):**  What gets in the way and what I see all the time is ego and network.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:27:40):**  Unfortunately, the farming system has gotten to the point where there's a bit of a pride  
**[0:27:45-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:27:45):**  of how long we spend doing the task.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:27:48):**  If we know we spent X amount inoculating weeds with poison or we sit on a tractor until there's  
**[0:27:55-0:27:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:27:55):**  a bit of a net worth that's put on that.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:27:57):**  And one of the biggest struggles that we have when talking to farmers who are going through  
**[0:28:01-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:28:01):**  this transition is that whole question of what am I going to do if we just leave it  
**[0:28:06-0:28:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:28:06):**  in the hands of Mother Nature?  
**[0:28:08-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:28:08):**  And again, that comes back to mindset where it's spend time with your family, go to your  
**[0:28:13-0:28:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:28:13):**  kids plays, go to the soccer days, the field days, the local markets.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:28:18):**  Like there are things that you can now do with this free time that you've gotten because  
**[0:28:23-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:28:23):**  Mother Nature and the microbes in the ground are going to do all the heavy lifting for  
**[0:28:28-0:28:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:28:28):**  you.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:28:29):**  And we have gotten to that point where our net worth is linked by the hustle or how hard  
**[0:28:34-0:28:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:28:34):**  do we work or how many hours we're sitting on a tractor doing things.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:28:40):**  And yeah, again, it's just a mindset shift that it can happen.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:28:45):**  And it's not something that happens overnight.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:28:47):**  You don't wake up one morning and go, I'm a regenerative farmer and I don't need to  
**[0:28:51-0:28:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:28:51):**  go on the tractor anymore.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:28:53):**  It's something that you need to do with someone holding your hand and a mentor and other people  
**[0:28:59-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:28:59):**  that think the same that can really guide you through that change and someone to lean  
**[0:29:05-0:29:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:29:05):**  on when things aren't working or you need a bit of a course correction.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:29:09):**  And I mean, so this all sounds well and good, but like you were saying, it is a transition  
**[0:29:13-0:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:29:13):**  process and to shift from an industrial farming management method over to a regenerative one  
**[0:29:21-0:29:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:29:21):**  takes some time.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:29:22):**  It requires educational resources.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:29:25):**  Mentorships can be helpful.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:29:27):**  And one of the things that I've heard from these other interviews as well is that the  
**[0:29:31-0:29:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:29:31):**  larger motivator in many cases is the profitability that can be gained from working with nature,  
**[0:29:37-0:29:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:29:37):**  which up until recently has seemed counterintuitive.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:29:41):**  People think that all of these systems have been optimized over years for profitability  
**[0:29:46-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:29:46):**  and for business reasons, but it actually turns out that managing holistically can lead  
**[0:29:52-0:29:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:29:52):**  to much bigger profits.  
**[0:29:53-0:29:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:29:53):**  How have you seen that correlation between ecological management practices and farm profitability?  
**[0:29:59-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:29:59):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:30:00):**  And yeah, so the main observation that I see is that I guess, you know, I come from the  
**[0:30:06-0:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:30:06):**  business startup world and there's this big kind of thinking of what they call lean startup  
**[0:30:12-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:30:12):**  and it's about running your business lean.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:30:15):**  And I know that farmers are now starting to also get around these systems and it's really  
**[0:30:20-0:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:30:20):**  that ethos of working smarter, not harder.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:30:24):**  The profitability will increase.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:30:27):**  Like it's not a matter of if, it's almost a matter of when.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:30:31):**  The resilience that farmers have to get to that finishing line is the real struggle.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:30:36):**  Unfortunately, we have farmers who have their backs up against the walls.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:30:41):**  They have bills to pay, they have loans to pay back.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:30:45):**  The initiative really needs to be how do those farmers get support during that transition  
**[0:30:50-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:30:50):**  period?  
**[0:30:51-0:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:30:51):**  And I love the movement of crowdfunding or in America, it's big to support like a CSA,  
**[0:30:58-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:30:58):**  a community supported agriculture system that hasn't really happened here in Australia.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:31:03):**  And I love the ability of, you know, like even Kickstarter, you can give money to a  
**[0:31:07-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:31:07):**  campaign and wait a year or so until you get your product.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:31:11):**  And we're starting to see that happen with farming as well, where there are a group of  
**[0:31:15-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:31:15):**  people who will sign up to a CSA and say, we want to give you money upfront so you can  
**[0:31:20-0:31:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:31:20):**  transition your farm over the next 12 months.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:31:23):**  And we're happy to get our reward in 12 to 24 months when your food is grown in a regenerative  
**[0:31:30-0:31:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:31:30):**  mindset.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:31:31):**  And so we're starting to see lifelines kind of handed out in that regards where farmers  
**[0:31:36-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:31:36):**  cannot go to that shortcut that they know will give them the yield to pay this month's  
**[0:31:43-0:31:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:31:43):**  bills or this quarter's bills or this year's bills.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:31:47):**  We need to start thinking, what's the five to 10 year plan on this farm and not season  
**[0:31:53-0:31:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:31:53):**  to season or yield to yield.  
**[0:31:55-0:31:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:31:55):**  And that's one of the other problems that I've kind of identified.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:31:58):**  And I love the movement of syntropic farming, not to throw another buzzword out, but I've  
**[0:32:04-0:32:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:32:04):**  been really researching this syntropic farming system that works kind of with companion planting  
**[0:32:11-0:32:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:32:11):**  and having this 10 to 20 year plan on your farm where you will grow food in amongst young  
**[0:32:19-0:32:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:32:19):**  trees that those trees will grow in 10 years time.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:32:23):**  And they will also be a profit in 10 years time because you plant them closer than what  
**[0:32:29-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:32:29):**  they need to be.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:32:30):**  And then you thin them out, they create revenue, but then the trees are established in the  
**[0:32:36-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:32:36):**  density that they need to thrive in.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:32:39):**  And it creates other inputs into the soil through the dropping of leaves and through  
**[0:32:46-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:32:46):**  the other animals that those trees attract and the other plants that you can grow around  
**[0:32:52-0:32:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:32:52):**  these trees.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:32:53):**  And so this linear monocropping kind of gets broken down.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:32:57):**  It becomes more about hunting and gathering through these food forests.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:33:03):**  And what I love about it is that the farmers are planning for that 10 to 15 year plan.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:33:08):**  And really, if you're going to hand their farm over to your kids or keep it in the family,  
**[0:33:13-0:33:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:33:13):**  that's really what they want.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:33:14):**  They don't want to see month to month paychecks.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:33:18):**  They think, well, I might as well just go get a job and have off farm jobs because that's  
**[0:33:22-0:33:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:33:22):**  the same kind of reward and input that I'm getting.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:33:26):**  And so this long term thinking is really kind of what needs to happen.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:33:32):**  And so the profits will come, but the resilience of the farmer may not be there initially because  
**[0:33:38-0:33:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:33:38):**  there are other forces forcing them to make quick, quick wins rather than the long term  
**[0:33:45-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:33:45):**  delayed gratification that can come with regen farming.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:33:48):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:33:49):**  And so now that we've sort of given an idea of the mentality that comes through this,  
**[0:33:54-0:34:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:33:54):**  the commonalities that you found in working with this wide range of farms and practitioners  
**[0:34:00-0:34:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:34:00):**  that have started to make this transition, could you maybe tell me a story or two from  
**[0:34:04-0:34:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:34:04):**  the practitioners that you've seen and highlighted through Farming Secrets that are emblematic  
**[0:34:10-0:34:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:34:10):**  of this transition that you were talking about and give a roadmap or an inspirational idea  
**[0:34:17-0:34:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:34:17):**  of what it could look like for someone who is transitioning from an industrial farming  
**[0:34:22-0:34:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:34:22):**  model?  
**[0:34:23-0:34:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:34:23):**  Yeah.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:34:24):**  I wish Helen and Hugo were here because they have an abundance of stories and know firsthand  
**[0:34:27-0:34:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:34:27):**  all the stats and figures.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:34:28):**  And I'm kind of learning through them.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:34:31):**  But we've seen some really good results and we have a whole heap of success stories on  
**[0:34:36-0:34:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:34:36):**  our website.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:34:37):**  In fact, so what happened with Farming Secrets is we would go to a field day and record the  
**[0:34:43-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:34:43):**  content at these field days so we could then send it 10 years ago on DVDs to other farming  
**[0:34:49-0:34:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:34:49):**  members around the world.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:34:51):**  And that's where the name came is that we wanted to share the secrets that farmers were  
**[0:34:55-0:34:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:34:55):**  having to every other farmer around the world, hence Farming Secrets.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:34:59):**  And what's happened is that so many of the students that were in those classrooms 10  
**[0:35:06-0:35:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:35:06):**  years ago are now experts sharing more of their stories.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:35:11):**  And there's been a whole heap of positive case studies.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:35:15):**  One that kind of is in my mind is of a dairy farmer.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:35:20):**  And what they did is they realised that they had a lot of waste outputs in their farm as  
**[0:35:26-0:35:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:35:26):**  well.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:35:27):**  And so when you start observing and that whole holistic closed loop system, you start realising  
**[0:35:32-0:35:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:35:32):**  that a problem is actually a solution to something else.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:35:37):**  And so waste management in dairy is a big problem.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:35:43):**  And so they were using that waste into compost that they would then put in that compost tea  
**[0:35:48-0:35:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:35:48):**  back onto their farm, onto their pastures, which then the cows would eat.  
**[0:35:53-0:35:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:35:53):**  And so the milk quality then started increasing.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:35:57):**  And they were fortunate enough to be in a community that really backed them and supported  
**[0:36:01-0:36:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:36:01):**  them.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:36:02):**  And that's one of the other elements that I really see with Regen Ag is that community  
**[0:36:06-0:36:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:36:06):**  support that if you share your vision and what you are wanting to achieve, people will  
**[0:36:12-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:36:12):**  get behind you and really support you.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:36:15):**  I think the whole universe is kind of getting to a point now where we are understanding  
**[0:36:19-0:36:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:36:19):**  that not everything has an instant gratification.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:36:22):**  We want to have that delayed gratification.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:36:25):**  And so by looking at the problem of the cows that were being milked, having all this waste,  
**[0:36:31-0:36:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:36:31):**  they realised that that waste could be used to put back into their farm by a different  
**[0:36:39-0:36:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:36:39):**  vehicle.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:36:40):**  We've seen a lot of success with a lot of farmers doing cover cropping or cell grazing  
**[0:36:47-0:36:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:36:47):**  and just really observing the land and going, well, this paddock looks a little bit too  
**[0:36:51-0:36:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:36:51):**  short still.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:36:52):**  Let me not put any grazers on here yet.  
**[0:36:56-0:36:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:36:56):**  Let me wait a week or two.  
**[0:36:58-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:36:58):**  And having even little micro delays or taking cows off paddocks just that one day sooner  
**[0:37:07-0:37:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:37:07):**  means that the grass grows back more lush and with more nutrient rather than eating  
**[0:37:12-0:37:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:37:12):**  it down too low.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:37:14):**  But it really comes from observing.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:37:16):**  So there are just so many success stories, I guess.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:37:22):**  I can't quote you the stats and the figures, but this dairy farm went off and launched  
**[0:37:27-0:37:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:37:27):**  a whole new brand of milk and the cancel was on board.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:37:31):**  They did this massive launch in the city of Melbourne where they had this amazing amount  
**[0:37:36-0:37:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:37:36):**  of people turn up to buy this milk that was grass fed and the farm was holistically managed  
**[0:37:44-0:37:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:37:44):**  with a regenerative approach to it.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:37:48):**  And they had media there interviewing everyone.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:37:50):**  There was people dressed up as cows, giving everyone free milk, which was probably a real  
**[0:37:54-0:37:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:37:54):**  big attraction.  
**[0:37:55-0:38:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:37:55):**  But that all came because they thought differently and they questioned the system and when I  
**[0:38:01-0:38:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:38:01):**  could possibly do it a bit different or have the land work for me.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:38:09):**  And yeah, it's just one of those situations where you really just have to stop and slow.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:38:17):**  We also have Colin Sice.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:38:19):**  We worked with Colin Sice, well, Helen and Hugo did many years ago.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:38:23):**  He's kind of pioneering the pioneer of cover cropping.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:38:27):**  And his story is that it was a little bit out of an unfortunate event.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:38:32):**  There was an actual disaster that kind of caused him to lose everything.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:38:36):**  And he had to really rebuild from scratch and he had this blank canvas.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:38:40):**  So he thought, let me do it a bit differently.  
**[0:38:42-0:38:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:38:42):**  Colin Sice was one of the early day supporters of Farming Secrets.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:38:47):**  He's done a lot of video content for us.  
**[0:38:49-0:38:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:38:49):**  We've filmed him at numerous field days.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:38:52):**  And recently he was featured in the 2040 field talking about regenerative farming.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:38:57):**  And we were very humbled to kind of know that we've seen his journey from being a student  
**[0:39:02-0:39:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:39:02):**  to now featured in a documentary, educating and spreading his message of cover cropping  
**[0:39:08-0:39:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:39:08):**  and how that can really help your farm ecosystem.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:39:13):**  And you mentioned a minute ago about some of the main practices that are helping people  
**[0:39:18-0:39:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:39:18):**  to transition their land like cover cropping and cell grazing or holistic managed grazing  
**[0:39:25-0:39:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:39:25):**  practices.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:39:26):**  What have you found are some of the most key things that people focus on that once fixed  
**[0:39:32-0:39:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:39:32):**  sort of take care of many others?  
**[0:39:34-0:39:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:39:34):**  It kind of goes back to that analogy you were talking about, you know, giving a painkiller  
**[0:39:37-0:39:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:39:37):**  for a shoulder problem or shoulder pain and it leading to all sorts of other symptoms  
**[0:39:44-0:39:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:39:44):**  down the line.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:39:45):**  Well, at the same time, there are things you can do to the root of problems that solve  
**[0:39:49-0:39:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:39:49):**  all sorts of other symptoms so you don't have to keep sort of playing whack-a-mole with  
**[0:39:53-0:39:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:39:53):**  every minor thing that comes up.  
**[0:39:56-0:39:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:39:56):**  What are some of those things that you found been effective for the farmers that you've  
**[0:39:59-0:40:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:39:59):**  worked with and profiled through Farming Secrets?  
**[0:40:03-0:40:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:40:03):**  Yeah, I want to give tactics, but my natural default is to be a bit more mindset driven.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:40:12):**  It's actually just being open that there could be a different way.  
**[0:40:16-0:40:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:40:16):**  My biggest advice for that is by a microscope and start understanding what's happening under  
**[0:40:25-0:40:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:40:25):**  your feet.  
**[0:40:26-0:40:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:40:26):**  Take an interest.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:40:28):**  Now, what's really difficult in this sector, and I struggle with this as well, is there's  
**[0:40:33-0:40:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:40:33):**  really big words with letters that apparently are silent and I don't know how to pronounce  
**[0:40:38-0:40:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:40:38):**  any of this stuff.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:40:39):**  And that's okay because we just need to know, you know, the thing is people go, well, I  
**[0:40:44-0:40:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:40:44):**  don't know what all these microbes names are and what they do.  
**[0:40:47-0:40:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:40:47):**  And I go, yeah, but you also don't know the names of the chemicals that are in your fertilizer,  
**[0:40:50-0:40:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:40:50):**  but you still use it.  
**[0:40:52-0:40:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:40:52):**  So take the same approach about it.  
**[0:40:55-0:41:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:40:55):**  Understand that there is this life form happening underneath your feet and take more of an interest  
**[0:41:01-0:41:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:41:01):**  of what's happening there.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:41:05):**  And really building up the organic matter in your soil solves a lot of the drought problems,  
**[0:41:10-0:41:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:41:10):**  the flooding problems, the topsoil runoff problems of erosion.  
**[0:41:16-0:41:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:41:16):**  Grass grows with so much more nutrient that then gets eaten by the livestock or whether  
**[0:41:22-0:41:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:41:22):**  you're growing produce that nutrient density goes into the food.  
**[0:41:29-0:41:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:41:29):**  Understanding what happens under the ground is going to solve a lot of the above the ground  
**[0:41:33-0:41:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:41:33):**  problems.  
**[0:41:34-0:41:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:41:34):**  And so by a microscope or learn more about the below the ground ecosystem, the soil food  
**[0:41:41-0:41:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:41:41):**  web, however you want to refer to it.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:41:45):**  There is an abundance of information out there.  
**[0:41:47-0:41:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:41:47):**  There's heaps of experts now.  
**[0:41:51-0:41:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:41:51):**  There are labs dedicated to doing more sophisticated soil tests.  
**[0:41:55-0:41:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:41:55):**  You don't need to understand all that.  
**[0:41:58-0:42:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:41:58):**  It's very similar again to go to the doctor's analogy because that's how everyone kind of  
**[0:42:02-0:42:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:42:02):**  gets things, but when you go for a blood test, you don't really understand when you look  
**[0:42:06-0:42:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:42:06):**  at that report what everything means.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:42:09):**  But you have a practitioner to give you layman's terms in it and you need to treat your farm  
**[0:42:13-0:42:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:42:13):**  the same way.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:42:14):**  He's get a soil test.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:42:16):**  You don't need to understand what it all means, but have someone explain it to you in a way  
**[0:42:20-0:42:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:42:20):**  where it says these are the common things that we see here.  
**[0:42:23-0:42:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:42:23):**  And from experience, you need to be doing X, Y and Z.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:42:27):**  And it may be cover cropping.  
**[0:42:28-0:42:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:42:28):**  It may be cell grazing.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:42:31):**  It may be a whole heap of different approaches.  
**[0:42:37-0:42:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:42:37):**  How you get there is really difficult to give advice on because it's very different from  
**[0:42:42-0:42:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:42:42):**  neighbor to neighbor.  
**[0:42:44-0:42:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:42:44):**  That's what's really difficult is you really need that personalized experience and knowing  
**[0:42:52-0:42:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:42:52):**  what you're trying to achieve.  
**[0:42:55-0:42:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:42:55):**  Here in Australia, we have a carbon credit scheme and a lot of farmers are trying to  
**[0:42:59-0:43:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:42:59):**  get carbon into their soil so they can make money from that through the carbon scheme.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:43:05):**  Some farmers just that doesn't align with their values, but they want to measure their  
**[0:43:09-0:43:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:43:09):**  carbon so they know how much they're putting back into the soil just for their own personal  
**[0:43:14-0:43:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:43:14):**  goals.  
**[0:43:15-0:43:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:43:15):**  So you don't need to go and get certified for carbon credits if that's not what you  
**[0:43:19-0:43:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:43:19):**  want.  
**[0:43:20-0:43:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:43:20):**  But people give advice on that and they go, well, I don't want carbon credits.  
**[0:43:23-0:43:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:43:23):**  I can't be a region farmer.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:43:25):**  And that's where the system kind of breaks down as we need to understand what each individual  
**[0:43:28-0:43:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:43:28):**  person's goals and outcomes are and design a plan and a pathway for them specifically.  
**[0:43:34-0:43:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:43:34):**  Yeah, it seems like anytime we start to break things down into isolated parts, like whether  
**[0:43:41-0:43:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:43:41):**  regenerative farming is defined by putting carbon back in the soil rather than creating  
**[0:43:47-0:43:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:43:47):**  healthy ecosystems that obtain a yield, you know, or looking at a certain nutrient in  
**[0:43:54-0:44:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:43:54):**  the soil or trying to optimize for one monoculture plant.  
**[0:44:00-0:44:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:44:00):**  As soon as we start to break things apart and separate their connections, then everything  
**[0:44:06-0:44:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:44:06):**  starts to fall apart with it.  
**[0:44:08-0:44:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:44:08):**  And the more things are observed as whole systems, as sort of the sum and even more  
**[0:44:15-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:44:15):**  so than all of the parts inside of them.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:44:19):**  That's where these kind of key observations can be made like, oh, maybe this is missing  
**[0:44:24-0:44:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:44:24):**  from the system because there's a broken link here.  
**[0:44:27-0:44:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:44:27):**  That's something that we can attend to.  
**[0:44:29-0:44:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:44:29):**  Or even what naturally occurring element of this ecosystem can be put back in or nurtured  
**[0:44:37-0:44:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:44:37):**  somehow or given the inputs that it needs to thrive so that it creates this connection  
**[0:44:43-0:44:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:44:43):**  which is currently missing.  
**[0:44:45-0:44:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:44:45):**  And that seems to be, like you were saying, the key mindset or observational differences  
**[0:44:50-0:44:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:44:50):**  between going in there with a microscope and trying to reduce everything down to its parts.  
**[0:44:54-0:44:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:44:54):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:44:56-0:44:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:44:56):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:44:57-0:45:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:44:57):**  And nutrient dense food is really the key.  
**[0:45:01-0:45:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:45:01):**  Your yields could be less, but you're growing better food that people then pay more for.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:45:07):**  And so another kind of way of looking at food is, you know, it's nutrient dollar index is  
**[0:45:14-0:45:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:45:14):**  how much nutrients am I getting for the dollars I'm paying?  
**[0:45:19-0:45:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:45:19):**  You know, we can't compare apples with apples anymore.  
**[0:45:22-0:45:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:45:22):**  It's really being able to understand how much nutritional value that food has and then go,  
**[0:45:30-0:45:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:45:30):**  well, I'm willing to pay $2 more a kilo because this food is better quality and I can actually  
**[0:45:36-0:45:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:45:36):**  eat less and get more nourished.  
**[0:45:39-0:45:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:45:39):**  And that's from a consumer point of view.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:45:41):**  And we're starting to see that where people will buy better quality food.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:45:46):**  Here in Australia anyway, we see that people in restaurants are starting to put where produce  
**[0:45:51-0:45:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:45:51):**  comes from.  
**[0:45:52-0:45:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:45:52):**  It's no longer a steak on a plate.  
**[0:45:56-0:46:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:45:56):**  It's a grass fed, 18, 40 day aged steak from Mary and Jill's farm, 400 meters down the road.  
**[0:46:09-0:46:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:46:09):**  And people want to know exactly where their food's coming from and that story behind it.  
**[0:46:13-0:46:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:46:13):**  Yeah, and it makes sense, especially because we've been disconnected from our food for  
**[0:46:17-0:46:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:46:17):**  so long.  
**[0:46:18-0:46:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:46:18):**  But one last thing that I really wanted to touch on before we wrap it up here, and that's  
**[0:46:24-0:46:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:46:24):**  trying to understand what some of the biggest roadblocks to making ecological management  
**[0:46:29-0:46:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:46:29):**  practices to the norm around the world currently are.  
**[0:46:32-0:46:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:46:32):**  And certainly it's different in different places around the world.  
**[0:46:34-0:46:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:46:34):**  You can use Australia as your example or some other place that you know of.  
**[0:46:38-0:46:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:46:38):**  Is it that many people still don't realize that this is possible?  
**[0:46:43-0:46:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:46:43):**  Or are there other factors holding it back?  
**[0:46:46-0:46:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:46:46):**  Yeah, I think it's as human nature to do what's common for us.  
**[0:46:54-0:47:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:46:54):**  It's easy, I guess, if you need to go and join a gym, it's easier not to.  
**[0:47:00-0:47:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:47:00):**  And in the back of your mind, you know, I should really join the gym.  
**[0:47:03-0:47:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:47:03):**  I want to get more fit.  
**[0:47:04-0:47:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:47:04):**  I want to get strong strength.  
**[0:47:05-0:47:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:47:05):**  I want to build up some muscle.  
**[0:47:08-0:47:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:47:08):**  And you know what you want to do and the intention could be there, but actually taking that action  
**[0:47:13-0:47:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:47:13):**  can be hard.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:47:14):**  Or we join for a month and then cancel because it's easier not to go.  
**[0:47:17-0:47:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:47:17):**  I think it's with that in everything in life.  
**[0:47:21-0:47:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:47:21):**  And this is exactly the same situation is I think a lot of farmers know that change  
**[0:47:27-0:47:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:47:27):**  is needed or they want to do things differently, but it's very easy to fall back into what  
**[0:47:33-0:47:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:47:33):**  is common and what's the path of least resistance, I guess.  
**[0:47:39-0:47:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:47:39):**  This is why the mindset and the value of why you're doing this needs to be greater than  
**[0:47:44-0:47:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:47:44):**  the effort to deliver.  
**[0:47:46-0:47:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:47:46):**  And so, you know, one of the other things that has happened recently, too, with the  
**[0:47:53-0:47:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:47:53):**  whole pandemic and COVID-19 is that the importing gates have stopped.  
**[0:47:58-0:48:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:47:58):**  And so farmers are getting to a point where they can't buy the chemicals they would normally  
**[0:48:02-0:48:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:48:02):**  buy all the inputs that they would normally be inputting.  
**[0:48:05-0:48:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:48:05):**  And so they go in, well, hang on a minute.  
**[0:48:07-0:48:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:48:07):**  I remember someone talking about a natural way of doing it or a different way of doing  
**[0:48:11-0:48:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:48:11):**  it.  
**[0:48:12-0:48:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:48:12):**  Let me go and explore that.  
**[0:48:13-0:48:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:48:13):**  And sometimes this is what people need.  
**[0:48:15-0:48:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:48:15):**  You know, there are so many stories of the smoker quitting smoking after they have the  
**[0:48:20-0:48:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:48:20):**  lung cancer diagnosis or someone eats healthy after they have a heart attack.  
**[0:48:25-0:48:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:48:25):**  Like humans need this critical situation to happen to then have that kind of wake up call.  
**[0:48:32-0:48:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:48:32):**  And the same thing is what I'm observing is that we're getting people bringing up and  
**[0:48:37-0:48:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:48:37):**  going, oh, I can't get what I normally would get.  
**[0:48:39-0:48:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:48:39):**  Tell me about this other alternative way of farming.  
**[0:48:43-0:48:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:48:43):**  And we go, oh, interesting.  
**[0:48:44-0:48:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:48:44):**  Now you kind of have a bit of an open.  
**[0:48:46-0:48:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:48:46):**  And so they're being forced to listen.  
**[0:48:48-0:48:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:48:48):**  And it's a really positive thing in my in my eyes is that we're kind of forcing people  
**[0:48:54-0:48:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:48:54):**  to change their way of thinking.  
**[0:48:56-0:49:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:48:56):**  And sometimes that's what humans need as that wake up call, because they won't wake up one  
**[0:49:01-0:49:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:49:01):**  day and go, I want to do it.  
**[0:49:03-0:49:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:49:03):**  You know, you know, in a regenerative way, that could be a little bit more work initially.  
**[0:49:09-0:49:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:49:09):**  And it's really the opposite.  
**[0:49:11-0:49:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:49:11):**  You know, once farmers do get great results from this, they do have to do less for it  
**[0:49:16-0:49:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:49:16):**  because Mother Nature and all the microbes do all the work for them.  
**[0:49:21-0:49:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:49:21):**  You know, so, yeah, it's just that open mindedness that willing to try things differently.  
**[0:49:28-0:49:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:49:28):**  And that real the easy way to do it is like, you know, to use the gym analogy is you don't  
**[0:49:34-0:49:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:49:34):**  hit the gym every day of the week and exhaust yourself.  
**[0:49:37-0:49:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:49:37):**  You might go once every two weeks and build up from there and go, you know, build up your  
**[0:49:42-0:49:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:49:42):**  rhythm.  
**[0:49:43-0:49:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:49:43):**  Regenerative farming transition is the same.  
**[0:49:45-0:49:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:49:45):**  Start with, you know, one acre, start with one paddock, start with one crop, one area  
**[0:49:51-0:49:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:49:51):**  and do that differently.  
**[0:49:52-0:49:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:49:52):**  And maybe one year it's bad and year two it's bad.  
**[0:49:56-0:49:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:49:56):**  And then year three, you hit the jackpot.  
**[0:49:58-0:50:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:49:58):**  And that one, that good year could make up for the last four years of losses.  
**[0:50:04-0:50:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:50:04):**  You know, and so it's that kind of being willing to take that risk and that leap of faith.  
**[0:50:10-0:50:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:50:10):**  And it isn't really a risk anymore because we have so many farmers case studying their  
**[0:50:14-0:50:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:50:14):**  abundance results over the years, over the last decade or so.  
**[0:50:19-0:50:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:50:19):**  So it is really the most least riskiest time to start farming this way.  
**[0:50:25-0:50:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:50:25):**  Yeah, that's a, it's an important observation there.  
**[0:50:28-0:50:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:50:28):**  And it does really seem like we're in this sort of watershed moment.  
**[0:50:32-0:50:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:50:32):**  It's what gives me hope that what we're going through now in retrospect could have been  
**[0:50:38-0:50:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:50:38):**  perhaps some of the most positive changes for our global society.  
**[0:50:43-0:50:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:50:43):**  And it seems like you and Farming Secrets have really put together the body of work  
**[0:50:48-0:50:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:50:48):**  to help this transition along in order for it to be a positive event in the long run.  
**[0:50:55-0:51:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:50:55):**  And with that said, can you tell our listeners a little more about how they can get in contact  
**[0:51:00-0:51:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:51:00):**  and find more information and resources?  
**[0:51:02-0:51:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:51:02):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:51:03-0:51:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:51:03):**  Well, Farming Secrets was built on this is really just going out and helping farmers  
**[0:51:09-0:51:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:51:09):**  achieve what success look like for them.  
**[0:51:12-0:51:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:51:12):**  And so we really became the glue to people, that community, I guess the word that kind  
**[0:51:19-0:51:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:51:19):**  of gets thrown around now is the tribe or like-minded people.  
**[0:51:23-0:51:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:51:23):**  And so Farming Secrets is a membership model where you pay to gain access to a community  
**[0:51:31-0:51:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:51:31):**  of people who may have gone through that process originally, or even more powerful going through  
**[0:51:37-0:51:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:51:37):**  it with you.  
**[0:51:38-0:51:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:51:38):**  So you can learn together and learn out loud.  
**[0:51:40-0:51:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:51:40):**  We have an array of courses that are available as well that can get people started to really  
**[0:51:45-0:51:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:51:45):**  understand what's happening below their feet or what regenerative farming can do for them  
**[0:51:52-0:51:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:51:52):**  or what they needed to look out for to be better observers of their land.  
**[0:51:58-0:52:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:51:58):**  And so we have a, you know, array of courses, we have a member body of people who are going  
**[0:52:03-0:52:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:52:03):**  through it or have been through it to support and lean on each other.  
**[0:52:07-0:52:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:52:07):**  And so if that is something that kind of feels like you would like to be more involved with  
**[0:52:13-0:52:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:52:13):**  then farmingsecrets.com is the website.  
**[0:52:17-0:52:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:52:17):**  And we have heaps of information there, resources, downloads, videos, links off to our YouTube.  
**[0:52:24-0:52:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:52:24):**  There's, you know, decades worth of video footage.  
**[0:52:27-0:52:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:52:27):**  And the good stuff, the good thing about this information is that it never really ages,  
**[0:52:32-0:52:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:52:32):**  even if it was recorded 10 years ago, it's still relevant because it's somewhat, it's  
**[0:52:38-0:52:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:52:38):**  just the way mother nature works.  
**[0:52:40-0:52:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:52:40):**  And so things that were being voiced 10 years ago still matter today.  
**[0:52:46-0:52:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:52:46):**  But the one thing that I just want everyone to really realise is you don't have to go  
**[0:52:50-0:52:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:52:50):**  out and be the success story overnight.  
**[0:52:53-0:52:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:52:53):**  This is a process and a journey, and that's what we're really interested in.  
**[0:52:57-0:53:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:52:57):**  We, our goal is to turn students into experts.  
**[0:53:02-0:53:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:53:02):**  So when you come on board, we understand where you're at, what you want to achieve and how,  
**[0:53:08-0:53:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:53:08):**  you know, our success is your success.  
**[0:53:11-0:53:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:53:11):**  And so once you've become a successful farmer, you're encouraged to be an expert.  
**[0:53:17-0:53:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:53:17):**  And we've got so many people in our community who have become the success story, who then  
**[0:53:21-0:53:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:53:21):**  just want to teach it to other people and put courses together or do, you know, farm  
**[0:53:26-0:53:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:53:26):**  tours, virtual farm tours, where they'll take our members through their farm and show how  
**[0:53:32-0:53:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:53:32):**  it's all working.  
**[0:53:34-0:53:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:53:34):**  And that's what I really, really love is this learning out loud to community where everyone's  
**[0:53:40-0:53:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:53:40):**  researching and kind of adding value.  
**[0:53:42-0:53:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:53:42):**  And we have this compounding effect of knowledge and information.  
**[0:53:47-0:53:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:53:47):**  And yeah, it's just, it is that kind of space of like-minded people where you don't feel  
**[0:53:52-0:53:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:53:52):**  alienated when you bring up an idea or a thought.  
**[0:53:56-0:54:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:53:56):**  And you know, as Joel Sullivan says, like, you want to be that lunatic farmer.  
**[0:54:01-0:54:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:54:01):**  And we have a group of lunatic farmers who are encouraging everyone to be more lunatic  
**[0:54:05-0:54:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:54:05):**  every day and question the system, question what they're doing, thinking out loud and  
**[0:54:11-0:54:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:54:11):**  sharing those results and outcomes.  
**[0:54:15-0:54:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:54:15):**  It's very exciting.  
**[0:54:16-0:54:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:54:16):**  Now, Ray, I really want to thank you for taking the time to break this down and explain it  
**[0:54:20-0:54:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:54:20):**  better for myself and the listeners.  
**[0:54:22-0:54:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:54:22):**  And I really hope that we can stay in touch.  
**[0:54:25-0:54:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:54:25):**  I look forward to keeping an eye on the new resources that are coming out and very excited  
**[0:54:31-0:54:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:54:31):**  to see this organization grow and thrive.  
**[0:54:33-0:54:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:54:33):**  Awesome.  
**[0:54:34-0:54:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:54:34):**  Excellent.  
**[0:54:35-0:54:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:54:35):**  And I think that's a really important point because it's one thought is everything you're  
**[0:54:37-0:54:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:54:37):**  doing doesn't matter.  
**[0:54:39-0:54:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:54:39):**  So even just listening to this podcast has changed your future, the world's future.  
**[0:54:44-0:54:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:54:44):**  And that is really powerful that everything you're doing matters.  
**[0:54:48-0:54:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:54:48):**  Be conscious about that.  
**[0:54:49-0:54:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:54:49):**  The way that you shop, what you buy, your voting power with your wallet, it all matters.  
**[0:54:55-0:54:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:54:55):**  So it doesn't matter how little it is.  
**[0:54:56-0:55:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:54:56):**  It might seem like it doesn't impact, but it definitely does.  
**[0:55:00-0:55:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:55:00):**  So keep doing what you're doing.  
**[0:55:01-0:55:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-milidoni/#t=0:55:01):**  Thank you for having us on the show and really excited to share it around.

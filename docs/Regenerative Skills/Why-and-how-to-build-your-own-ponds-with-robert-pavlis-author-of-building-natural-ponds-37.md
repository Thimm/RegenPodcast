**[0:01:26-0:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:01:26):**  Have you ever felt completely bogged down by the weight of current events and news?  
**[0:01:30-0:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:01:30):**  Things like climate change, government corruption, war and violence seem to be the norm and hard  
**[0:01:34-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:01:34):**  to get away from.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:01:35):**  I know these things affect me deeply and that's why I'm always looking for positive news  
**[0:01:40-0:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:01:40):**  and media about solutions and inspiring change.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:01:44):**  That's why I'm proud to say that I've partnered with one of my favorite sources for just those  
**[0:01:47-0:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:01:47):**  things.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:01:48):**  New Society Publishers are book publishers that focus on putting out great books and  
**[0:01:52-0:01:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:01:52):**  positive solutions for individuals and organizations seeking to change their lives so that they  
**[0:01:58-0:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:01:58):**  can go on to change the world for the better.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:02:00):**  And what's more, their company mandate goes far beyond the single bottom line of profit.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:02:05):**  They actually care deeply, not only about what they publish but also about how they  
**[0:02:09-0:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:02:09):**  do business.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:02:10):**  They believe in the authors they take on and the works they bring to the marketplace.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:02:15):**  From sustainable living to progressive parenting, New Society Publishers have the books you  
**[0:02:19-0:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:02:19):**  need to help build a better world.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:02:21):**  In fact the author that I'm interviewing today, Robert Pavlis, and his book Building  
**[0:02:25-0:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:02:25):**  Natural Ponds are published by them.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:02:28):**  And if you stay tuned at the end of this interview, I'll tell you how you can be eligible to win  
**[0:02:32-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:02:32):**  your own copy of the Permaculture Market Garden.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:02:35):**  So stick around for that after the interview.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:02:38):**  Alright, so in this episode I'm going to try something just a little bit different because  
**[0:02:42-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:02:42):**  I'm actually not in Guatemala for this interview.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:02:45):**  I'm visiting my family in Minnesota right now and I'm here with my younger brother,  
**[0:02:49-0:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:02:49):**  Arthur, who has agreed to do the introduction for me this time.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:02:52):**  So here's Arthur.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:02:53):**  Hey everyone, we're really excited about today's guest, Robert Pavlis.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:02:58):**  Robert is a master gardener who has designed and cultivated his own world-class private  
**[0:03:03-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:03:03):**  botanical garden on his property in Ontario, Canada.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:03:07):**  He is also the author of both Gardening Myths and Building Natural Ponds.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:03:11):**  Today's episode will be focusing on natural ponds through Robert's successes and learning  
**[0:03:16-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:03:16):**  experience in mimicking nature to bring all the benefits of a pond into his garden environment.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:03:22):**  In this interview, Robert talks in detail about the increased biodiversity both in the  
**[0:03:26-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:03:26):**  water and along the shores that a pond attracts.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:03:30):**  We go into pond lining options, simple diagnostics for water quality, design considerations,  
**[0:03:35-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:03:35):**  and much more.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:03:36):**  Now some of you Permese and regenerative landscaping folks might find that this interview is a  
**[0:03:41-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:03:41):**  bit heavy on the residential and gardening perspective.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:03:44):**  You'd be right.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:03:46):**  So I would challenge you to leave comments on the Abundant Edge Facebook page or in the  
**[0:03:50-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:03:50):**  comment section under this episode on the website if you'd like to challenge any of  
**[0:03:53-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:03:53):**  the information in this interview or offer a different perspective on pond construction.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:03:58):**  Honestly though, I think just about anyone will find a goldmine of information in here.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:04:03):**  Robert does a fantastic job of breaking down the design and installation into really easy  
**[0:04:08-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:04:08):**  to follow steps that we know will empower you to build a pond of your own.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:04:12):**  Now if that's the case, then stay tuned at the end of this interview to see how you can  
**[0:04:16-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:04:16):**  win your very own copy of the book Building Natural Ponds.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:04:20):**  Now I'll turn things over to Robert Pavlis.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:04:22):**  Hey Robert, how are you today?  
**[0:04:24-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:04:24):**  It's such a pleasure to have you to join me.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:04:26):**  It's great to be here.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:04:29):**  Thanks for having me.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:04:30):**  My pleasure now, before we jump into the questions, could you tell our listeners about yourself  
**[0:04:34-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:04:34):**  and how you became passionate about botanical gardening and natural ponds?  
**[0:04:39-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:04:39):**  Well, I've been gardening for a long time.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:04:44):**  So I started gardening when I was about 21.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:04:49):**  I've always been interested in trying to figure out how to streamline gardening and use ideas  
**[0:04:59-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:04:59):**  from nature to try and make gardening simpler.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:05:02):**  I've also always been interested in trying to find out what the real facts are about  
**[0:05:08-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:05:08):**  certain aspects of gardening, why we do things and why things work and why things don't work.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:05:16):**  My background is both in chemistry and biochemistry.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:05:20):**  And then I moved on into business and marketing and spent most of my life actually developing  
**[0:05:26-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:05:26):**  a software company.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:05:28):**  So gardening and ponds is really just a hobby of mine.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:05:33):**  But my business allowed me to take early retirement and spend more time on my gardens.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:05:40):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:05:41):**  Now to get us started, could you explain for us why someone would want a pond in their  
**[0:05:46-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:05:46):**  yard or ecosystem and some of the benefits that natural ponds specifically bring?  
**[0:05:54-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:05:54):**  There's a lot of reasons.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:05:57):**  Some people want a pond to attract wildlife.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:06:01):**  So people today are planting things for things like butterflies, for instance.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:06:08):**  But if you have a pond, then you start attracting all kinds of other things, different types  
**[0:06:12-0:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:06:12):**  of frogs and toads, dragonflies.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:06:16):**  I have quite a few different kinds of dragonflies now on the property since I've put in a pond.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:06:22):**  So there's that interest in having nature come to your garden, which is both a benefit  
**[0:06:29-0:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:06:29):**  and a negative aspect, right?  
**[0:06:32-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:06:32):**  Some of that nature you really don't want to come to your pond.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:06:35):**  A lot of people get a pond to have fish.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:06:39):**  Fish is still a really popular hobby and pond lets you add that to your garden.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:06:46):**  From a gardener's perspective, there's also aesthetic reasons for having it.  
**[0:06:50-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:06:50):**  I think it adds a very unique element to the garden and is a good place, a focal point  
**[0:07:01-0:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:07:01):**  in the garden.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:07:02):**  You can put plants all around it.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:07:05):**  So there are really lots of reasons.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:07:07):**  People just like sitting there and watching it, watching the fish or watching the animals.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:07:13):**  If it's a pond with some moving water, then you also have the noise that comes from having  
**[0:07:20-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:07:20):**  the waterfall.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:07:23):**  And so that's also attractive in a garden.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:07:26):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:07:27):**  Now, could you talk a little bit more about how a natural pond fits into a garden landscape?  
**[0:07:32-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:07:32):**  You talked about the biodiversity that it tends to bring.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:07:35):**  Maybe use yours as an example since I know you have an incredible botanical garden in  
**[0:07:39-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:07:39):**  southern Ontario where you live.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:07:42):**  So I bought a property about 12 years ago now.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:07:48):**  It's about six acres.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:07:51):**  Most of it is wooded but some of it is open.  
**[0:07:55-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:07:55):**  When I moved here, I decided to have a very large garden.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:07:58):**  So I now have the largest private garden.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:08:02):**  My design around the house is a bit more formal but as it moves away from the house, my design  
**[0:08:10-0:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:08:10):**  becomes much more natural looking.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:08:14):**  My large pond is actually a fair distance from the house.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:08:18):**  I wanted it to look as natural as possible.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:08:23):**  Ideally I want people, when they see it, to think that it's always been there, that it  
**[0:08:28-0:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:08:28):**  hasn't been man-made.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:08:30):**  So from a design perspective, I think that's really important.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:08:37):**  It's not a necessity for a pond.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:08:39):**  You can have a very formal pond but a lot of people like to make it look more natural.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:08:46):**  So then it becomes a combination of water and plants and rocks put together in such  
**[0:08:53-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:08:53):**  a way that it really looks as if man did not make this pond.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:08:58):**  If you can get to that point, then I think you've accomplished something.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:09:02):**  So that's always been my goal with both parts of my garden and my ponds.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:09:07):**  Have you found that it creates sort of a microclimate around the area that affects the way that  
**[0:09:12-0:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:09:12):**  your plants grow?  
**[0:09:15-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:09:15):**  I don't think so.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:09:20):**  Most ponds are lined so if you're going to line the pond, then the soil around the pond  
**[0:09:26-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:09:26):**  is actually quite dry.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:09:28):**  It's no wetter than anywhere else in your garden.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:09:31):**  So it doesn't become a wet area.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:09:35):**  I imagine there's a bit more humidity around the pond and maybe the temperature is slightly  
**[0:09:41-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:09:41):**  lower, but I don't think that really changes the way the plants grow.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:09:48):**  What it does do though is it has a different wildlife there.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:09:52):**  The insects you see, the reptiles you see and so on are quite different and much more  
**[0:09:59-0:10:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:09:59):**  populous near a pond than away from it.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:10:03):**  I can walk around my garden all day and not see any leopard frogs and if I go to the pond,  
**[0:10:08-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:10:08):**  I can easily count 20 of them.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:10:11):**  So the life that's living there is quite different.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:10:14):**  The animal life.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:10:16):**  The plant life is really only going to be different if you let it happen naturally.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:10:24):**  If you plant things, then whatever you plant is what you have in the pond.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:10:29):**  In fact, in my large pond, I now have two different species of bulrushes and neither  
**[0:10:35-0:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:10:35):**  one has been planted.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:10:37):**  They both started growing on their own the second year I had the pond.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:10:41):**  So that seed somehow blew in from some other pond in the neighborhood, I guess, and they  
**[0:10:46-0:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:10:46):**  started growing.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:10:48):**  So some of the plants will just grow naturally like that.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:10:52):**  Yeah, it really sounds like it just sort of attracts life to it.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:10:56):**  So how do natural ponds keep their water clean and how can you ensure that your pond water  
**[0:11:01-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:11:01):**  stays healthy with natural methods?  
**[0:11:05-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:11:05):**  So let me take you back a bit and how this whole thing started.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:11:09):**  Sure.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:11:10):**  As I said, my pond, I have a pond and then I have a large waterfall and the large waterfall  
**[0:11:17-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:11:17):**  was made in the more traditional way of using pumps, although I don't use any filters.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:11:23):**  I do have a pump to move the water up top the hill and have it flow back down again.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:11:28):**  So then I decided, well, I want this pond and it's farther away from the house and it's  
**[0:11:33-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:11:33):**  in a wooded area.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:11:35):**  And I thought, okay, well, one of the problems is I don't have electricity there.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:11:40):**  So to have a pond, I need to run electricity up there.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:11:44):**  And I really didn't want to do that.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:11:47):**  And I started thinking about it and thought, well, in nature, there's no pumps and there's  
**[0:11:52-0:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:11:52):**  no filters.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:11:54):**  These ponds just exist all on their own.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:11:58):**  So why wouldn't that work if I make the pond?  
**[0:12:01-0:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:12:01):**  So I did a lot of research and everything I came across said that that won't work.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:12:07):**  Everybody was convinced that if you have a liner in your pond, that makes it unnatural  
**[0:12:13-0:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:12:13):**  and then you need to clean it and filter it and pump water and use chemicals and all the  
**[0:12:18-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:12:18):**  other things.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:12:20):**  But nobody could explain why that was the case.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:12:24):**  So I finally decided, you know what, I'm just going to give it a try and see what happens.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:12:30):**  And if it doesn't work well, then I guess I have to run some hydro up there and get  
**[0:12:33-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:12:33):**  a pump going.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:12:35):**  So I built this with a liner.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:12:39):**  I designed it right from the start so I could grow a lot of plants in the pond.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:12:45):**  And that's a critical point because most ponds are designed with few plants and a pump.  
**[0:12:55-0:12:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:12:55):**  And I decided to go with lots of plants and no pump.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:12:59):**  So I have these planting shells around the pond which take up a good part of the surface  
**[0:13:04-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:13:04):**  area of the water.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:13:07):**  And the theory is, and this pond's now been in place for over 10 years so it's really  
**[0:13:12-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:13:12):**  no longer a theory.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:13:15):**  But the water stays clean if there is a lower amount of algae and bacteria in the water.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:13:22):**  And particularly the algae is the problem.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:13:25):**  And algae grows when there's lots of sun, lots of nutrients.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:13:31):**  Well if there's lots of other plants, they use up the nutrients so there isn't any left  
**[0:13:36-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:13:36):**  for the algae.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:13:38):**  So the reason the water stays clean is because the plants are your natural filtration system.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:13:43):**  They're taking all the nutrients and using it to grow.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:13:48):**  And once the nutrient level gets low enough, algae can't grow.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:13:51):**  So algae needs higher nutrients than most other plants.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:13:57):**  And so you can have plants growing just fine, but the algae stops growing.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:14:02):**  Once the algae stops growing, then you start having clean water.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:14:07):**  And it really is that simple.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:14:09):**  Now it also helps to keep nutrients out of your pond.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:14:12):**  So there's certain things you do.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:14:14):**  You can't fill the pond with a huge number of fish because fish poop in the water and  
**[0:14:21-0:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:14:21):**  add nutrients.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:14:23):**  So you have to watch how many fish you have and balance that against how many plants you  
**[0:14:27-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:14:27):**  have.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:14:29):**  But the bottom line is, once you get that balance, the water stays clean.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:14:37):**  The plants in fact are limited in the amount of growth they can have because they can only  
**[0:14:44-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:14:44):**  grow if there's enough nutrients.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:14:46):**  And if they use up too much nutrients, they just slow down a little bit.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:14:50):**  But you've got to have enough plants to make sure you get to that point.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:14:54):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:14:55-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:14:55):**  Now let's go back and talk about that a little bit because I know that a lot of the people  
**[0:14:59-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:14:59):**  that I've worked with who are interested in natural ponds also want to have fish, either  
**[0:15:03-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:15:03):**  for aesthetic reasons or even for harvesting.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:15:06):**  Could you tell me a little about how fish function in these ponds and how can you maintain  
**[0:15:11-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:15:11):**  them in a healthy way without chemicals or pumps?  
**[0:15:15-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:15:15):**  Again, it comes back to the balance.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:15:19):**  Having a certain number of fish balanced with the plants that you have.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:15:26):**  So I can put, I run goldfish in my pond and I just keep the numbers down and the nutrients  
**[0:15:35-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:15:35):**  that the fish add are used up by the plants.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:15:40):**  If I put too many fish in, I'll start having a problem.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:15:44):**  So the key is to balance how many fish you have and how many plants you have so that  
**[0:15:50-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:15:50):**  you don't overdo the fish.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:15:52):**  The other thing you try to do is limit the nutrients that the fish have.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:15:57):**  So for instance, when I put fish in my pond, I don't feed them.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:16:03):**  I want those fish to eat what's in the pond.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:16:06):**  If I start throwing a lot of food in there, the food is more nutrients, the fish will  
**[0:16:11-0:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:16:11):**  eat them, process it and I get more nutrients in the pond.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:16:15):**  So I never feed fish in the pond.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:16:19):**  I just let them go natural.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:16:21):**  Now if you have a larger pond and you're trying to raise fish and that's your primary goal,  
**[0:16:27-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:16:27):**  you probably would end up feeding those fish.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:16:30):**  But those ponds typically are much larger and deeper and so you still have to maintain  
**[0:16:38-0:16:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:16:38):**  a balance of not too many fish.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:16:41):**  If you cram the fish in there, then you'll end up with a pond that has too many nutrients  
**[0:16:48-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:16:48):**  and then you'll have algae problems and then you have all kinds of other problems.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:16:52):**  So is that the main indicator that your system is sort of falling out of balance, is just  
**[0:16:56-0:17:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:16:56):**  the appearance of algae or are there other things that you can look out for?  
**[0:17:02-0:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:17:02):**  Algae is the biggest problem and all ponds will have some algae.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:17:06):**  So there's no such thing as a pond free algae or a pond without algae.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:17:13):**  The key is that it's there and it doesn't grow very much.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:17:17):**  As soon as it starts growing, particularly the filamentous type algae which forms this  
**[0:17:23-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:17:23):**  kind of scum on the water.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:17:25):**  As soon as you see that, you know that you have too much sun and too many nutrients.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:17:34):**  Both of them play a factor.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:17:37):**  So the nutrients we've talked about, the other one is sun so it's very good to have plants  
**[0:17:43-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:17:43):**  on top of the water.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:17:44):**  So water lilies are great because they kind of shade the pond.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:17:48):**  But as long as you don't see the algae growing, you're fine.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:17:53):**  So in my pond for instance, I've never tested the water.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:17:57):**  I have no idea what the water is.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:18:01):**  I have some idea of the kind of water we have in this area.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:18:04):**  It's very hard water.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:18:07):**  I use my well to fill the pond and then after that whatever the pond does to it, I don't  
**[0:18:16-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:18:16):**  know.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:18:17):**  I don't test for nitrates, I don't test pH, I don't test for any of those things.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:18:21):**  I just leave it alone.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:18:24):**  Every once in a while I do top it up because unfortunately we don't get enough rain here  
**[0:18:28-0:18:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:18:28):**  to keep it topped up.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:18:31):**  And so once or twice a summer I'll bring the level up to a higher level.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:18:36):**  But other than that, I don't do anything else to the pond.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:18:39):**  I never change the water.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:18:42):**  I just top it up once in a while.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:18:45):**  Sure.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:18:46):**  Now what are some of the primary design considerations when it comes to ponds and what are some of  
**[0:18:51-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:18:51):**  the things that you can do to make them more natural looking?  
**[0:18:56-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:18:56):**  Well one of the things I suggest is to actually go out and look at real ponds.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:19:02):**  So go into the woods, find some ponds that you know are what I call native ponds and  
**[0:19:10-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:19:10):**  that there hasn't been a lot of development around, there hasn't been a lot of activity  
**[0:19:14-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:19:14):**  by people.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:19:16):**  So they look pretty much the way they did 50, 100 years ago.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:19:20):**  And just ask yourself why does this look natural?  
**[0:19:26-0:19:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:19:26):**  So if you go through this process there are certain things that help you out.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:19:33):**  One is that natural ponds tend to be a little messy.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:19:38):**  So if you see someone's pond in the backyard and you know it's sort of a certain shape  
**[0:19:44-0:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:19:44):**  and it's all clean and there's no logs laying around and so on it starts looking unnatural.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:19:52):**  As soon as you start putting a few logs in there, you leave a few weeds here and there  
**[0:19:56-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:19:56):**  and it's cleaned up less it starts looking more natural.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:20:02):**  Selection of rocks can be very important too.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:20:05):**  So again if you go and look at these ponds you won't find a pond in the woods where every  
**[0:20:12-0:20:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:20:12):**  rock is the same size around the pond.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:20:16):**  They're all different sizes, you know, large ones, small ones, round ones, square ones,  
**[0:20:21-0:20:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:20:21):**  different colors, whatever happens to be in that area.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:20:25):**  So when you're building your pond you want to do the same thing.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:20:27):**  You want to have a large mixture of types of rocks.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:20:32):**  Another thing I notice is that when I look at a natural pond there's almost always rocks  
**[0:20:38-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:20:38):**  in the water, not just around the edge.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:20:41):**  There's this in the shallow area you'll see rocks sticking out.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:20:46):**  Particularly as the summer goes along and the water levels drop, these rocks become  
**[0:20:51-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:20:51):**  more and more prominent.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:20:53):**  And so you can design the ponds you actually have some rocks in the water that again adds  
**[0:20:58-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:20:58):**  to the natural look of the place.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:21:03):**  One of the secrets to both allowing you to have enough plants and to design it to look  
**[0:21:11-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:21:11):**  natural is to make sure you can't see the liner.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:21:19):**  And most designs don't do that.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:21:25):**  So if you go and get yourself a book on making ponds, if you follow the instructions you  
**[0:21:30-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:21:30):**  will see the liner when you're finished.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:21:34):**  And that was something that really bothered me because I really don't want to see the  
**[0:21:37-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:21:37):**  liner.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:21:39):**  So what I do is I use planting shelves all the way around the outside of the pond and  
**[0:21:44-0:21:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:21:44):**  those planting shelves are somewhere around 6 to 10 inches deep.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:21:50):**  And those get filled with rocks and they cover the liner and once the water goes up high  
**[0:21:58-0:22:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:21:58):**  enough over the shelves I don't see the liner.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:22:02):**  So you can build a pond and not see the liner.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:22:07):**  And those planting shelves are hiding the liner but they're also giving you a perfect  
**[0:22:11-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:22:11):**  place to put all your plants.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:22:13):**  So these shelves now get filled with plants and they're keeping your water clean.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:22:23):**  I see some really nice ponds in pictures and so on.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:22:29):**  And if you see the liner it just kind of spoils the whole impact.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:22:33):**  Yeah, I agree.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:22:35):**  It kind of takes you out of that ecosystem that they're trying to create there.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:22:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:22:40):**  Now actually that's great because that's what I want to talk about next because I know there's  
**[0:22:42-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:22:42):**  a number of different ways to seal ponds from leaking.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:22:46):**  Could you talk a bit about how a few of these options work, which ones are available and  
**[0:22:52-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:22:52):**  which personally would you recommend?  
**[0:22:55-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:22:55):**  Well I think there are really only two ways you can seal the pond.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:23:02):**  So what I would recommend for most people, particularly if you're building a smaller  
**[0:23:07-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:23:07):**  pond in a backyard, is just get a liner.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:23:11):**  Now there are two kinds of liners that you can get.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:23:14):**  There's the flexible rubber liner and then there's what they call a hard shell.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:23:21):**  So if you're building a very small pond the hard shell works quite well.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:23:26):**  It's very easy to install.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:23:28):**  You sort of dig a hole, stick it in and you're done.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:23:32):**  And you know exactly what the pond's going to look like because this shell is already  
**[0:23:37-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:23:37):**  pre-made and is made out of plastic.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:23:39):**  So you know exactly what it's going to look like.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:23:42):**  The problem with the pre-made ones is that they tend to be on the smaller size.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:23:49):**  So if you want a big pond they're difficult to get.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:23:53):**  They don't have planting shelves.  
**[0:23:56-0:23:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:23:56):**  You're sort of stuck with the design that happens to be in the store when you go to  
**[0:23:59-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:23:59):**  buy them.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:24:00):**  They change the design very easily.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:24:03):**  If you use a rubber liner on the other hand you can make it any shape you want.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:24:09):**  And you can make it as large as you want.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:24:11):**  You can actually join these pieces of rubber together quite easily and make really huge  
**[0:24:16-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:24:16):**  ponds with the rubber liner.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:24:19):**  So I think most people should probably use the rubber liner unless they're doing a relatively  
**[0:24:24-0:24:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:24:24):**  small pond.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:24:26):**  And the rubber is, you use a 40 mil rubber that's designed for ponds and you're pretty  
**[0:24:34-0:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:24:34):**  much guaranteed not to have any leaks for at least a dozen years.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:24:40):**  Don't cheap out and use some other kind of plastics.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:24:43):**  It's just not worth it.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:24:45):**  The effort to replace that or fix a hole is just too big and it just isn't worth the money.  
**[0:24:54-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:24:54):**  The other alternative is to have a pond that naturally seals itself.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:25:00):**  And that requires a certain type of soil, usually a higher clay level.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:25:06):**  The problem with those kind of ponds is that they're never 100% sealed.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:25:11):**  So there's always some seepage out of the pond.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:25:17):**  So they work well if you have some water coming in constantly.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:25:22):**  So if you're in an area that gets lots of rain, then that's not a problem.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:25:27):**  Or if you build this pond, say at the bottom of a hill, where you get runoff on the hill  
**[0:25:32-0:25:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:25:32):**  whenever it rains and it runs into your pond.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:25:35):**  Or you have a spring on the property and you can direct the spring water to the pond.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:25:41):**  But clay lined ponds always leak a little bit.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:25:47):**  And you really need to have this constant addition of water.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:25:52):**  Now to make a clay pond, you can do it a couple different ways.  
**[0:25:55-0:26:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:25:55):**  Some people are lucky enough that their soil just has a high clay level and all you really  
**[0:26:00-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:26:00):**  have to do is dig the hole and fill it with water and it will sit there.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:26:05):**  Other people will bring clay in and have someone actually layer it around the pond and make  
**[0:26:13-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:26:13):**  a six inches to a foot thick clay layer everywhere and let that seal the pond.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:26:23):**  You can buy some commercial products that are clay type product that actually expand  
**[0:26:28-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:26:28):**  when they get wet and they seal it.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:26:33):**  But those all leak a little bit and it's really hard to predict how much leaky you're going  
**[0:26:39-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:26:39):**  to get with those.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:26:42):**  So if you're building, particularly if you're building a big pond, probably worthwhile talking  
**[0:26:47-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:26:47):**  to someone who's familiar with the soil in your area and knows exactly how fast it's  
**[0:26:54-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:26:54):**  going to leak out the water.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:26:59):**  So those are the two options.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:27:01):**  You can use a clay liner.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:27:05):**  One way you can test that is just dig some pilot holes that are as deep as you want your  
**[0:27:10-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:27:10):**  pond to be, fill them with water a couple of times and just see what happens.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:27:15):**  If that water runs away fairly quickly then you probably can't use that option.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:27:23):**  Now you may still be able to dig the hole and buy commercial clay or bring some clay  
**[0:27:27-0:27:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:27:27):**  in and do it that way.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:27:30):**  But that I think becomes less of a do it yourself project and more of a hire an expert who knows  
**[0:27:36-0:27:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:27:36):**  how to make a clay lined pond so it's done right.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:27:40):**  Sure.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:27:41):**  So, now what are some of the concerns that people often have about installing ponds and  
**[0:27:47-0:27:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:27:47):**  perhaps the maintenance that usually comes with unnatural ponds?  
**[0:27:51-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:27:51):**  How are natural ones different?  
**[0:27:54-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:27:54):**  Well probably the biggest fear I think most people have is getting a hole in the pond  
**[0:28:01-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:28:01):**  and having it leak out.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:28:06):**  And that actually happens very rarely.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:28:10):**  So called leaks are in waterfalls where the water is actually running over top of the  
**[0:28:15-0:28:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:28:15):**  liner.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:28:17):**  You very seldom actually get holes in the liner.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:28:21):**  If you do they can be patched.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:28:23):**  The tricky part is finding the hole.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:28:25):**  But once you've found the hole you can just put a patch on very similar to patching a  
**[0:28:30-0:28:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:28:30):**  bicycle tire.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:28:31):**  It's a special glue that you have and you buy a patch and you stick it on and let it  
**[0:28:35-0:28:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:28:35):**  dry and the liner is good as new.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:28:41):**  The algae is a big problem.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:28:45):**  People are concerned about that.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:28:49):**  As far as maintenance goes, as I said my pond really isn't any maintenance.  
**[0:28:54-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:28:54):**  I haven't done a thing to my pond all year.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:28:57):**  I don't even scoop the leaves out in the bottom in the fall.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:29:01):**  I just leave them there.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:29:03):**  Although that's not a bad idea to clean out any fallen leaves that have accumulated in  
**[0:29:10-0:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:29:10):**  the fall and get them out of there.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:29:12):**  That will pull nutrients out and make it easier next year because you'll start with less nutrients.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:29:21):**  When you start going to equipment then you have all kinds of maintenance jobs that you  
**[0:29:26-0:29:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:29:26):**  have to do.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:29:27):**  If you have a pump you almost certainly have a pre-filter on that which needs to be cleaned  
**[0:29:32-0:29:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:29:32):**  on a regular basis.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:29:34):**  That pump may go into a regular biological filter.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:29:40):**  Those biological filters have various kinds of material in there, sponges and different  
**[0:29:46-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:29:46):**  types of little bits of plastic and so on.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:29:48):**  They need to be cleaned once in a while.  
**[0:29:53-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:29:53):**  People who have a lot of fish, so now we have a group of people who their main reason for  
**[0:30:00-0:30:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:30:00):**  having a pond really is to have koi.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:30:05):**  Koi are beautiful fish but they get big.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:30:09):**  They are very dirty fish.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:30:11):**  They produce a lot of nutrients and they're a bit more fussy on the water quality.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:30:20):**  Those people typically end up treating the water regularly, measuring nitrate levels  
**[0:30:26-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:30:26):**  to make sure they don't get too high.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:30:29):**  They now have a pond where they've crammed in a lot of fish into a small pond.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:30:36):**  They like that because you can see the fish really well and they enjoy the fish and the  
**[0:30:40-0:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:30:40):**  fish is the reason for being there so this works for them.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:30:44):**  As soon as you do that you're way off balance for the pond which means now you have more  
**[0:30:50-0:30:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:30:50):**  mechanical systems and more chemical systems to try and keep everything alive.  
**[0:30:56-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:30:56):**  That's the tradeoff and that's on a continuum.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:31:03):**  Some people with only a few koi in a big pond but most people with koi typically end up  
**[0:31:09-0:31:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:31:09):**  having quite a few after all and they grow which is the other problem you have to be  
**[0:31:14-0:31:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:31:14):**  aware of.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:31:15):**  You have a pond that's a certain size and you figure okay I can have 12 inch of fish  
**[0:31:21-0:31:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:31:21):**  and you can't buy 12 one inch fish because now they're all 12 inches.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:31:27):**  So they grow and you have to get rid of those fish now because you have too many or you  
**[0:31:33-0:31:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:31:33):**  have to do something else to keep the water clean.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:31:39):**  So could you tell me a little as well about some of the most common mistakes that people  
**[0:31:43-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:31:43):**  make or the things that they overlook when they're putting in a pond?  
**[0:31:51-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:31:51):**  Well from my perspective when I look at ponds and in fact a good way to see ponds before  
**[0:31:57-0:32:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:31:57):**  you build your own is to go on some garden tours.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:32:03):**  Most cities now have some sort of garden tours and there's always a couple with ponds in  
**[0:32:06-0:32:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:32:06):**  them.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:32:10):**  We actually have in Toronto we have a pond association and they have a garden tour every  
**[0:32:16-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:32:16):**  year and every garden on the tour has ponds.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:32:20):**  The tour is really more about the ponds and the gardens and that lets you go and see a  
**[0:32:24-0:32:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:32:24):**  lot of different types of ponds and different designs and so on and it gives you a good  
**[0:32:29-0:32:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:32:29):**  idea of what you like and don't like.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:32:33):**  Probably number one mistake people make is not making it big enough.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:32:38):**  I mean it's not really a mistake but what happens is you very seldom find people who  
**[0:32:46-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:32:46):**  wish they had made the pond smaller.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:32:49):**  It's kind of like having a shed right?  
**[0:32:51-0:32:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:32:51):**  The shed is never big enough.  
**[0:32:54-0:32:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:32:54):**  And once you have that pond you wish well if it was a little bigger I could grow different  
**[0:32:58-0:33:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:32:58):**  kinds of plants, I could have more fish.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:33:02):**  A larger pond is easier to take care of too because the balance isn't quite as critical.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:33:07):**  It doesn't get out of balance as easily.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:33:11):**  So most people wish they had a bigger pond.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:33:14):**  So make it as big as you can possibly make it.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:33:21):**  I mean other than that you have to get the equipment right.  
**[0:33:24-0:33:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:33:24):**  So one of the big questions I had when I built my waterfall is what size of pump do I need?  
**[0:33:34-0:33:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:33:34):**  And that's a really hard question to answer.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:33:37):**  And I spent a lot of time researching it.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:33:39):**  There's lots of formulas and calculations and so on.  
**[0:33:43-0:33:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:33:43):**  But in the end it really comes down to what you perceive as the right amount of water  
**[0:33:49-0:33:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:33:49):**  coming over a waterfall.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:33:51):**  Are you the kind who likes a Niagara Falls kind of effect?  
**[0:33:56-0:33:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:33:56):**  Or do you want more of a trickle effect?  
**[0:33:58-0:33:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:33:58):**  Right.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:33:59):**  What's the volume you're looking at?  
**[0:34:01-0:34:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:34:01):**  Yeah.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:34:02):**  And it's really hard to figure that out.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:34:06):**  And in the end I pretty much guessed at buying a pump.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:34:13):**  And it worked out about what I wanted.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:34:17):**  But that's hard.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:34:18):**  And probably the only way to really figure that out is to go and find someone who has  
**[0:34:23-0:34:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:34:23):**  a waterfall of the size that you want with the flow rate that you want and find out what  
**[0:34:30-0:34:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:34:30):**  kind of pump they use.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:34:32):**  And here where the key thing is the gallons per hour.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:34:37):**  But the height that you have to pump is also important.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:34:42):**  Because you can have a pump with really high flow rate, but it can't move water very high.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:34:50):**  And so if you build a waterfall that's six feet high it might have very little flow.  
**[0:34:56-0:35:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:34:56):**  The flow rate and the height it has to push the water are related to each other.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:35:02):**  That's one of the reasons it's hard to calculate.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:35:05):**  The other mistake I've seen that's related to that is the hose going from the pump to  
**[0:35:13-0:35:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:35:13):**  the top of the waterfall should be as big as possible.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:35:18):**  So most people think that the pump has to overcome gravity to lift water.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:35:24):**  And that just makes common sense, right?  
**[0:35:26-0:35:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:35:26):**  I'm going to have a waterfall that's six feet high.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:35:28):**  I've got to lift that water up six feet.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:35:31):**  And that's the gravity that's making that pump work.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:35:33):**  Well it turns out that's only partially true.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:35:37):**  A much bigger effect is the friction that you get inside the tubes.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:35:43):**  So I was at a nursery once and they had a little display and this waterfall was only  
**[0:35:47-0:35:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:35:47):**  a foot high.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:35:50):**  And the guy was explaining to me how yeah he had to go to a bigger pump because he wasn't  
**[0:35:53-0:35:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:35:53):**  getting the flow rate he wanted.  
**[0:35:56-0:36:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:35:56):**  But the hose was about an inch in diameter.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:36:00):**  And my waterfall uses a four inch PVC pipe.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:36:04):**  So I get very little friction going up that pipe.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:36:08):**  And as a result I don't lose much flow rate as I go up to the top of the waterfall.  
**[0:36:14-0:36:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:36:14):**  So you have to have a large outlet tube on your pump.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:36:21):**  And ideally the inlet's large too.  
**[0:36:24-0:36:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:36:24):**  But mostly on the outlet because that's usually the longer piece of tubing.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:36:29):**  So that's another reason to stay away from the mechanical things because every time you  
**[0:36:37-0:36:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:36:37):**  add one of these things it might not be quite what you want.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:36:41):**  And there's lots of other things to buy.  
**[0:36:44-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:36:44):**  There's UV sterilizers, you know do you need one of those?  
**[0:36:49-0:36:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:36:49):**  How often do you have to replace the lamps?  
**[0:36:51-0:36:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:36:51):**  How many lamps?  
**[0:36:52-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:36:52):**  Sure yeah it just gets more complex from there.  
**[0:36:54-0:37:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:36:54):**  It gets more and more and more complicated and more expensive and more maintenance and  
**[0:37:00-0:37:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:37:00):**  these things break down and have to be replaced and so on.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:37:04):**  And then on the other side you have well dig a hole, put in this liner, put some stones  
**[0:37:10-0:37:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:37:10):**  and plants around it and don't do anything.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:37:14):**  I agree yeah.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:37:15):**  It's an easy choice.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:37:18):**  Well the thing you miss is the little waterfall right?  
**[0:37:21-0:37:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:37:21):**  So it really comes down.  
**[0:37:23-0:37:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:37:23):**  If that waterfall is important you do need a pump.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:37:26):**  So when I built my waterfall I decided to keep it simple and I do have a pump.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:37:33):**  I do have a leaf trap on the inlet side which you pretty much need to keep large pieces  
**[0:37:39-0:37:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:37:39):**  out of the pump.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:37:41):**  But I don't have a filter.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:37:43):**  And so I figured well you know I have a, my waterfall raises up about 20 feet.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:37:49):**  It's actually five little ponds all joined together with smaller waterfalls.  
**[0:37:55-0:38:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:37:55):**  And all that rock and all that material in there and I put lots of plants in there.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:38:00):**  Those are all my biofilters.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:38:03):**  And so I never put in a biofilter and I don't use UV sterilizers and I don't use any chemicals.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:38:11):**  I can have goldfish in there.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:38:14):**  I don't right now because I actually took the goldfish out so the frogs breed better.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:38:22):**  So I have lots of frogs and the goldfish.  
**[0:38:25-0:38:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:38:25):**  But I even though I have a pump I've kept it simple.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:38:28):**  Basically I have a pump and that's it.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:38:30):**  All the other stuff I left out.  
**[0:38:34-0:38:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:38:34):**  And I'm letting the rocks become the surface where all the bacteria live and those are  
**[0:38:41-0:38:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:38:41):**  cleaning my water.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:38:43):**  And so those are my biofilters.  
**[0:38:45-0:38:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:38:45):**  But rather than having a separate mechanical container I have it in the pond.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:38:51):**  I just let the natural stones and plant roots be my biofilter.  
**[0:38:56-0:38:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:38:56):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:38:57):**  Yeah it's remarkable what mother nature can take care of when you just give her the tools  
**[0:39:03-0:39:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:39:03):**  to do her job.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:39:04):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:39:06):**  And that's been my approach to all aspects of it.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:39:10):**  Certainly.  
**[0:39:11-0:39:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:39:11):**  Now we've covered a lot of things here.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:39:12):**  We did waterfalls, we talked about the aesthetics, possibility of fish.  
**[0:39:16-0:39:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:39:16):**  How could you design for something larger like a natural swimming pool?  
**[0:39:20-0:39:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:39:20):**  And what would be the main differences in design considerations and managing the health  
**[0:39:24-0:39:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:39:24):**  of the water?  
**[0:39:27-0:39:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:39:27):**  So this is more popular in Europe than it is in North America but it seems to be catching  
**[0:39:33-0:39:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:39:33):**  on.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:39:35):**  So the idea is let's make a natural pond without pumps, without filters, but let's have an  
**[0:39:43-0:39:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:39:43):**  area for swimmers.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:39:45):**  So we can still have some fish although most people don't bother with the fish now.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:39:50):**  They want a definite area for swimmers.  
**[0:39:54-0:39:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:39:54):**  And it's really no different than a natural pond.  
**[0:39:58-0:40:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:39:58):**  You still have planting shelves so you want one area for your plants and those are going  
**[0:40:03-0:40:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:40:03):**  to clean your water and another area for swimmers.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:40:09):**  And most people will make the pond bigger so that they have enough area for swimming  
**[0:40:15-0:40:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:40:15):**  around in.  
**[0:40:16-0:40:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:40:16):**  But there's really no difference.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:40:19):**  Now the one thing you might want to do is to put in a pump now to circulate water.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:40:24):**  So you might have a little waterfall but you don't need to do that.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:40:29):**  But there is value in moving that water around for a couple of reasons.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:40:34):**  Now we have a large central area where the swimmers are and the plants are on the side  
**[0:40:40-0:40:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:40:40):**  and it's nice to move that water around a little more because the water will be cleaner  
**[0:40:44-0:40:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:40:44):**  that way.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:40:46):**  It also tends to keep it a little warmer that way because you don't have these cold pockets  
**[0:40:52-0:40:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:40:52):**  in the bottom of your swimming area.  
**[0:40:55-0:41:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:40:55):**  So sometimes people will actually add pumps but they don't really add filtration systems.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:41:00):**  They take the water from where the swimmers are, pump it to where the plants are and let  
**[0:41:05-0:41:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:41:05):**  the water run through the plants back towards where the swimmers are.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:41:11):**  And as it's going through the gravel and the plants roots it gets cleaned.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:41:17):**  So you're moving water around a little more for the swimmers.  
**[0:41:22-0:41:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:41:22):**  But other than that and the size there really isn't a lot of difference.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:41:30):**  Natural ponds we try to make them kind of odd shaped usually.  
**[0:41:34-0:41:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:41:34):**  Swimming area is better if it's kind of rectangular.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:41:37):**  The planting area can be irregular but the swimming area a lot of people will make it  
**[0:41:41-0:41:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:41:41):**  rectangular.  
**[0:41:42-0:41:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:41:42):**  Yeah, I've seen that.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:41:45):**  You want them usually deeper.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:41:46):**  So for swimmers you want four, five, six feet deep whereas ponds are generally more like  
**[0:41:53-0:41:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:41:53):**  three feet, four feet deep.  
**[0:41:56-0:42:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:41:56):**  So there's some small differences but as far as actually putting them together and the  
**[0:42:02-0:42:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:42:02):**  way they work they're really the same thing.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:42:06):**  Now I'm a big believer that natural ponds are beautiful and healthy additions for almost  
**[0:42:10-0:42:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:42:10):**  anyone but especially in residential settings.  
**[0:42:13-0:42:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:42:13):**  But I know that it's rarely ever as simple as just getting started digging.  
**[0:42:17-0:42:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:42:17):**  Could you talk about the permitting process and how someone might get started investigating  
**[0:42:21-0:42:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:42:21):**  the regulations around ponds in their area?  
**[0:42:25-0:42:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:42:25):**  Oh, okay.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:42:27):**  Well it's usually fairly simple.  
**[0:42:29-0:42:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:42:29):**  Phone, you know, the organization that's in charge of where you are.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:42:34):**  So in Canada it's usually the city or if you're out in the country it's probably a county  
**[0:42:41-0:42:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:42:41):**  office somewhere.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:42:43):**  And just phone them and see what the regulations are.  
**[0:42:47-0:42:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:42:47):**  The regulations in Guelph are kind of unusual I think.  
**[0:42:51-0:42:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:42:51):**  At least I thought they were odd.  
**[0:42:53-0:42:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:42:53):**  So I phoned the city and said I want to put in this pond.  
**[0:42:57-0:42:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:42:57):**  Do I need to fence it?  
**[0:42:59-0:43:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:42:59):**  Because in our city you certainly need a fence around a swimming area.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:43:05):**  And the answer was well what is the main purpose of this?  
**[0:43:08-0:43:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:43:08):**  Is it for swimming or is it a pond?  
**[0:43:10-0:43:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:43:10):**  And I said it's a pond.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:43:11):**  And he says well in that case there are no regulations.  
**[0:43:15-0:43:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:43:15):**  If it's for swimming you've got to fence it.  
**[0:43:20-0:43:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:43:20):**  But each district is going to be different.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:43:22):**  So you have to find out someone who knows what the regulations are for your area.  
**[0:43:28-0:43:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:43:28):**  It's possible that it needs to be fenced in.  
**[0:43:31-0:43:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:43:31):**  If I was in a typical suburb type area where the houses are close together and there's  
**[0:43:39-0:43:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:43:39):**  kids running around the neighborhood and so on it's probably a really good idea to fence  
**[0:43:43-0:43:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:43:43):**  it in.  
**[0:43:45-0:43:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:43:45):**  I wouldn't want neighbor kids running through my backyard and into the pond.  
**[0:43:50-0:43:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:43:50):**  So even if the regulations don't require fencing it's probably a good idea to have your back  
**[0:43:55-0:43:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:43:55):**  sure you just don't want that liability.  
**[0:43:57-0:43:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:43:57):**  You don't want to take a chance.  
**[0:43:59-0:44:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:43:59):**  I mean I can tell you that my grandchildren when they were little they loved the pond.  
**[0:44:05-0:44:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:44:05):**  But we stand right beside them because we knew they couldn't get out and they couldn't  
**[0:44:09-0:44:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:44:09):**  swim.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:44:10):**  So kids are drawn to water and you really have to be careful.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:44:19):**  In a typical backyard pond the only regulation I really know of is fencing.  
**[0:44:26-0:44:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:44:26):**  And there probably is a regulation about how close it could be to the neighbor's fence  
**[0:44:32-0:44:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:44:32):**  like to the property line.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:44:35):**  So most cities have some ordinance that says anything you build has to be three feet away  
**[0:44:42-0:44:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:44:42):**  from the property line or something like that.  
**[0:44:44-0:44:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:44:44):**  So there is probably something to that effect.  
**[0:44:48-0:44:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:44:48):**  I would imagine too in any sort of urban or even suburban area you want to definitely  
**[0:44:54-0:44:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:44:54):**  double check where the utility or water lines might be underground too before you start  
**[0:44:58-0:44:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:44:58):**  digging.  
**[0:44:59-0:45:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:44:59):**  Yeah, so particularly hydro and most jurisdictions now will check that for you for free.  
**[0:45:08-0:45:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:45:08):**  So always check before you start digging.  
**[0:45:14-0:45:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:45:14):**  And other than that it's work.  
**[0:45:17-0:45:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:45:17):**  Now again if you're doing digging you kind of figure out how you're going to dig it.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:45:23):**  Are you going to do this by hand or are you going to bring in some equipment and can you  
**[0:45:29-0:45:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:45:29):**  bring in equipment?  
**[0:45:31-0:45:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:45:31):**  A lot of houses these days there isn't a room to bring in an excavator into the backyard  
**[0:45:38-0:45:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:45:38):**  to dig a hole.  
**[0:45:39-0:45:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:45:39):**  So you kind of figure out how that's going to work.  
**[0:45:43-0:45:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:45:43):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:45:44-0:45:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:45:44):**  Well, digging is just work so.  
**[0:45:47-0:45:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:45:47):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah for sure.  
**[0:45:49-0:45:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:45:49):**  It's definitely been my experience.  
**[0:45:52-0:45:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:45:52):**  So wonderful.  
**[0:45:53-0:45:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:45:53):**  Now before I let you go could you tell our listeners about some of the other resources  
**[0:45:57-0:46:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:45:57):**  that you have available and where they can get in touch with you and find out more.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:46:03):**  All right.  
**[0:46:04-0:46:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:46:04):**  So I do have a blog, well let's call it a website under my name.  
**[0:46:11-0:46:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:46:11):**  So robertpavlos.com and you can reach most of my things from there.  
**[0:46:18-0:46:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:46:18):**  Some of my books are on there and my websites are listed there as a launching point to these  
**[0:46:24-0:46:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:46:24):**  other areas.  
**[0:46:26-0:46:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:46:26):**  I have a website called gardenmyths.com and it's really a blog so I post there usually  
**[0:46:34-0:46:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:46:34):**  once a week and I look at all kinds of different myths to do with gardening.  
**[0:46:41-0:46:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:46:41):**  Some of them to do with ponds but mostly gardening.  
**[0:46:45-0:46:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:46:45):**  So what do we know about gardening?  
**[0:46:47-0:46:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:46:47):**  That's not true.  
**[0:46:48-0:46:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:46:48):**  How do you get rid of slugs and you know when should you prune your trees and is it better  
**[0:46:54-0:46:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:46:54):**  to plant your trees in the spring or fall?  
**[0:46:57-0:47:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:46:57):**  So I look at all those sorts of things.  
**[0:47:00-0:47:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:47:00):**  So that's gardenmyths.com and I also have a second blog called gardenfundamentals.com  
**[0:47:08-0:47:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:47:08):**  which is more general gardening information.  
**[0:47:13-0:47:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:47:13):**  So I did a post there for instance how to tell which type of hydrangeas you have.  
**[0:47:20-0:47:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:47:20):**  People always have problems with hydrangeas.  
**[0:47:22-0:47:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:47:22):**  They're trying to figure out why they don't bloom and should they prune them and when  
**[0:47:26-0:47:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:47:26):**  should they prune them and so on.  
**[0:47:28-0:47:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:47:28):**  And the problem is that they don't actually know which type they have.  
**[0:47:32-0:47:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:47:32):**  So this one post helped people figure out the type and once you know the type then you  
**[0:47:37-0:47:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:47:37):**  know how to take care of it.  
**[0:47:39-0:47:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:47:39):**  So that's gardenfundamentals.com.  
**[0:47:43-0:47:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:47:43):**  And I've written two books.  
**[0:47:46-0:47:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:47:46):**  One is the sort of subject we've been talking about here, Building Natural Ponds.  
**[0:47:53-0:47:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:47:53):**  You'll find that on all my websites.  
**[0:47:55-0:47:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:47:55):**  There'll be links there or you can get it from Amazon.  
**[0:47:59-0:48:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:47:59):**  Sure and I'll be sure to link to all these websites and resources you're talking about  
**[0:48:02-0:48:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:48:02):**  on the show notes for the podcast as well.  
**[0:48:05-0:48:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:48:05):**  Okay great.  
**[0:48:06-0:48:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:48:06):**  And then the second book I've written is called Garden Myths.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:48:11):**  And so I published that last year and it's got about 120 different kind of gardening  
**[0:48:17-0:48:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:48:17):**  myths that I discuss.  
**[0:48:18-0:48:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:48:18):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:48:19-0:48:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:48:19):**  Well hey Robert, thank you so much for taking the time today.  
**[0:48:23-0:48:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:48:23):**  It was a real pleasure talking to you.  
**[0:48:25-0:48:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:48:25):**  I'll have to have you on again to talk more about gardening myths and fundamentals next  
**[0:48:28-0:48:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:48:28):**  time.  
**[0:48:29-0:48:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:48:29):**  Well that'd be great.  
**[0:48:30-0:48:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:48:30):**  Nice talking to you.  
**[0:48:32-0:48:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:48:32):**  Cheers.  
**[0:48:33-0:48:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:48:33):**  Well take care.  
**[0:48:34-0:48:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:48:34):**  Bye.

**[0:49:35-0:49:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:49:35):**  So before we wrap up this show for the week, I've got some exciting news about the upcoming  
**[0:49:38-0:49:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:49:38):**  months.  
**[0:49:39-0:49:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:49:39):**  And I'm joined here now with my good friend and founder of Atitlán Organics, Shad Goodsy.  
**[0:49:43-0:49:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:49:43):**  Hey buddy, what's new?  
**[0:49:45-0:49:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:49:45):**  Oh man, so much is happening.  
**[0:49:48-0:49:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:49:48):**  First off though, I just want to say thanks for having me, man.  
**[0:49:51-0:49:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:49:51):**  I really love your podcast and I actually had a great time doing that interview back  
**[0:49:55-0:49:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:49:55):**  in one of the earlier episodes.  
**[0:49:57-0:50:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:49:57):**  Anyway, probably what's most exciting is our new collaboration between Atitlán Organics  
**[0:50:02-0:50:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:50:02):**  and Abundant Edge.  
**[0:50:03-0:50:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:50:03):**  As you know, we've been offering permaculture design courses for over six years now and  
**[0:50:08-0:50:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:50:08):**  they really have become a staple here in Lake Atitlán.  
**[0:50:11-0:50:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:50:11):**  In particular though, the intro to permaculture course is just an amazing way for travelers,  
**[0:50:17-0:50:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:50:17):**  gardeners, architects, basically anyone to fully immerse themselves in this new paradigm  
**[0:50:22-0:50:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:50:22):**  of permaculture design.  
**[0:50:24-0:50:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:50:24):**  Like honestly, you can't take this course and still see the world the same way afterward.  
**[0:50:29-0:50:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:50:29):**  Yeah, that's for sure.  
**[0:50:30-0:50:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:50:30):**  It's life changing.  
**[0:50:31-0:50:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:50:31):**  But like I said, what I'm most excited about is that now, thanks to our collaboration,  
**[0:50:37-0:50:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:50:37):**  we're going to be able to offer your natural building course immediately after every one  
**[0:50:42-0:50:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:50:42):**  of our intro to permaculture courses.  
**[0:50:44-0:50:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:50:44):**  Literally, this two week offering is like possibly the most complete package that I  
**[0:50:49-0:50:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:50:49):**  know of available anywhere.  
**[0:50:52-0:50:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:50:52):**  Basically with these two courses alone, I think that someone should have everything  
**[0:50:56-0:51:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:50:56):**  they need to start their own regenerative project or just their own regenerative lifestyle.  
**[0:51:02-0:51:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:51:02):**  That's what I'm excited about, man.  
**[0:51:04-0:51:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:51:04):**  But yeah, what about you?  
**[0:51:05-0:51:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:51:05):**  What's going on?  
**[0:51:06-0:51:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:51:06):**  Man, well, you know already that me and the abundant edge team are gearing up for a big  
**[0:51:10-0:51:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:51:10):**  season as well.  
**[0:51:11-0:51:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:51:11):**  I mean, starting in November, we'll be breaking ground on a regenerative farming demonstration  
**[0:51:16-0:51:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:51:16):**  site, which is of course, right down the hill from your farm.  
**[0:51:19-0:51:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:51:19):**  We'll be building animal pens, a classroom, outdoor kitchens and lounge areas connected  
**[0:51:25-0:51:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:51:25):**  to houses.  
**[0:51:26-0:51:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:51:26):**  And it's all going to be made out of natural materials.  
**[0:51:28-0:51:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:51:28):**  I mean, the site is going to serve as a demonstration farm for perennial and regenerative farming  
**[0:51:33-0:51:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:51:33):**  methods for years and years to come.  
**[0:51:36-0:51:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:51:36):**  And we'll even be offering courses and internship opportunities to people who want to learn  
**[0:51:39-0:51:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:51:39):**  for themselves about how to build with natural materials and set up their own farms.  
**[0:51:45-0:51:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:51:45):**  Heck yeah, that sounds amazing, man.  
**[0:51:48-0:51:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:51:48):**  And honestly, this is just about the best place in the world to learn all these things  
**[0:51:51-0:51:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:51:51):**  too.  
**[0:51:52-0:51:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:51:52):**  I mean, this little town of Sununah in the gorgeous tropical mountains of Guatemala,  
**[0:51:56-0:52:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:51:56):**  like right here on the shores of Lake Atitlan, it's one of the most beautiful places in the  
**[0:52:00-0:52:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:52:00):**  world.  
**[0:52:01-0:52:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:52:01):**  On top of that, you have this traditional indigenous Mayan culture that's still rich  
**[0:52:06-0:52:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:52:06):**  and alive.  
**[0:52:07-0:52:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:52:07):**  And probably my favorite part is that we have this world international community of alternative  
**[0:52:13-0:52:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:52:13):**  people that are open to new ideas and really putting things into practice.  
**[0:52:17-0:52:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:52:17):**  I mean, within walking distance of the bamboo guest house, you've got loads of things going  
**[0:52:21-0:52:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:52:21):**  on.  
**[0:52:22-0:52:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:52:22):**  We got the projects that we've already talked about, but you also have yoga retreat centers.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:52:26):**  You have Charlie Rendell's natural bamboo building school.  
**[0:52:30-0:52:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:52:30):**  You have Love Probiotics.  
**[0:52:31-0:52:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:52:31):**  You've got Fungi Academy.  
**[0:52:33-0:52:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:52:33):**  And honestly, loads more alternative blow your mind type stuff.  
**[0:52:37-0:52:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:52:37):**  I honestly just feel like this is where it's all happening.  
**[0:52:40-0:52:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:52:40):**  Yeah, man, it really does.  
**[0:52:41-0:52:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:52:41):**  And I want to get as many people as possible in on these projects, but we've got to make  
**[0:52:45-0:52:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:52:45):**  sure that they've got the skills first.  
**[0:52:47-0:52:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:52:47):**  So what do you say?  
**[0:52:48-0:52:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:52:48):**  Let's offer a big discount to those who sign up for both courses.  
**[0:52:51-0:52:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:52:51):**  I mean, all food and lodging and the amazing bamboo guest house is already included in  
**[0:52:56-0:53:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:52:56):**  the tuition, so this will be like the best deal that we've ever offered.  
**[0:53:00-0:53:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:53:00):**  That's a great idea, because I mean, people can still take just one course if that's what  
**[0:53:04-0:53:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:53:04):**  they're into or if they can't make the full two weeks, but this will actually make the  
**[0:53:07-0:53:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:53:07):**  two courses more accessible to even a wider audience of people.  
**[0:53:11-0:53:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:53:11):**  That way more people can get the knowledge that they need to get started doing what they  
**[0:53:16-0:53:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:53:16):**  want to do.  
**[0:53:17-0:53:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-robert-pavlis/#t=0:53:17):**  So hey, to all of you listening out there, we really want passionate and driven people

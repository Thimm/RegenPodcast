### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 31 Dec 2021 06:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:00:00):**  This is Regenerative Skills, the podcast helping you to learn the skills and solutions to create  
**[0:00:09-0:00:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:00:09):**  an abundant and connected future.  
**[0:00:11-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:00:11):**  I'm your host, Oliver Gautier.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:00:14):**  All right, hello and welcome back everyone and a happy new year to all of you.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:00:20):**  This episode will be a bit different from the usual interviews as I want to take the  
**[0:00:24-0:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:00:24):**  opportunity to end this fifth season by giving a recap of the previous year and sharing some  
**[0:00:29-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:00:29):**  of the projects and inspirations that I have for this year to come.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:00:33):**  Make sure that you stay with me until the end as well because I have some exciting announcements  
**[0:00:37-0:00:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:00:37):**  to make about what's coming up in the next season and some ways that you can get involved  
**[0:00:41-0:00:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:00:41):**  and benefit directly as well.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:00:43):**  So I'm sure I don't need to tell any of you this, but 2021 has been a very unique  
**[0:00:50-0:00:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:00:50):**  year.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:00:51):**  After the real brunt of the pandemic in 2020, I believe no one really knew what to expect,  
**[0:00:57-0:00:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:00:57):**  least of all me.  
**[0:00:58-0:01:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:00:58):**  Here in Spain, we've gone through wave after wave of contaminations and restrictions and  
**[0:01:04-0:01:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:01:04):**  even confinements that have followed all of that.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:01:06):**  At the moment, we've entered into another soft lockdown and restrictions threatened  
**[0:01:11-0:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:01:11):**  to divide this population between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:01:16):**  And I personally am so exhausted from hearing that we're living in unprecedented times.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:01:22):**  At this point to me, it just sounds like a fancy admission that nobody knows what they're  
**[0:01:26-0:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:01:26):**  doing and trying to sound professional in their guesses and their predictions.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:01:31):**  It's really hard to have confidence in this shaky social structure and erratic economic  
**[0:01:36-0:01:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:01:36):**  systems that dictate so much of how we live.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:01:40):**  And yet there are some simple and timeless aspects of life that continue to bring me  
**[0:01:44-0:01:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:01:44):**  hope and inspiration as we head into another year that is sort of shrouded in a fog of  
**[0:01:50-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:01:50):**  uncertainty.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:01:52):**  And so for me, that has been and always will be my family.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:01:57):**  I am the oldest of five children in my family.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:02:01):**  And though us kids and my parents all live really quite far apart, I feel closer to them  
**[0:02:07-0:02:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:02:07):**  than ever.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:02:08):**  I've had the incredible fortune to reconnect with my parents and many of my mom's British  
**[0:02:12-0:02:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:02:12):**  side of the family in a short trip to England on the Isle of Ban that my partner and I took  
**[0:02:17-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:02:17):**  earlier this year.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:02:19):**  And tomorrow, just after this episode has come out, I will have gone to meet my sister  
**[0:02:24-0:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:02:24):**  Emily and her precious three little daughters, the youngest of whom, little Lou Jane, was  
**[0:02:28-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:02:28):**  born earlier this year and I haven't even met before.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:02:32):**  They get to stay here for a whole month since school vacations in Kuwait where they live  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:02:36):**  are really very generous and I'm so excited to take them on outdoor learning adventures  
**[0:02:41-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:02:41):**  every morning while they're here.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:02:43):**  We've already started calling it jungle school and I have so many activities planned.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:02:49):**  Now on top of all of this hope that my family brings, I've also noticed a real shift in  
**[0:02:54-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:02:54):**  general consciousness in the last couple of years.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:02:57):**  Maybe it's just me because of the line of work that I'm in, but I've seen a huge leap  
**[0:03:01-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:03:01):**  in interest in everything from ecosystem restoration and reforestation projects to growing your  
**[0:03:07-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:03:07):**  own food, developing resilient communities, and building with natural materials.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:03:12):**  Very rarely do I feel like I'm the weird one out in groups of new people when I'm talking  
**[0:03:16-0:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:03:16):**  about these topics anymore.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:03:18):**  And less and less do I have to explain common terms and the importance of things like biodiversity,  
**[0:03:23-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:03:23):**  cycling carbon in the soil, and building bioregional security.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:03:27):**  It's also encouraging to see all kinds of ecological neighborhood projects and community  
**[0:03:31-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:03:31):**  cleanups as well.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:03:32):**  Now that we still have a very long way to go to make these ideas and actions a central  
**[0:03:37-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:03:37):**  part of our collective culture, it definitely makes me happy to see how big of a leap in  
**[0:03:43-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:03:43):**  this direction that we have been taking, and even at the government and industry levels  
**[0:03:48-0:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:03:48):**  which are usually ones that lag the furthest behind.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:03:50):**  And this is really to the credit to all of you who are listening, for sharing these ideas  
**[0:03:55-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:03:55):**  and their importance with people around you in ways that aren't antagonistic, but are  
**[0:04:00-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:04:00):**  inviting and inspiring.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:04:02):**  I know it's so easy to get combative with others who you see working against these efforts  
**[0:04:06-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:04:06):**  and spreading misinformation, but you have done the hard work of listening deeply and  
**[0:04:12-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:04:12):**  finding ways to communicate compassionately.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:04:15):**  And it's having a real effect, I can see it, it's really noticeable, and I commend all  
**[0:04:19-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:04:19):**  of you and encourage you to keep persevering, even if it takes a while to see the results.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:04:25):**  You really can and have been making a difference.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:04:29):**  Now another aspect of my life that keeps me hopeful is the company that I work for, Climate  
**[0:04:34-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:04:34):**  Farmers, which has entered into its second year as a startup and we have so many ambitious  
**[0:04:39-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:04:39):**  and courageous projects planned.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:04:42):**  I get to work with a team of some of my best friends and people that I truly admire on  
**[0:04:46-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:04:46):**  challenging tasks of helping farmers across Europe to transition to regenerative management  
**[0:04:51-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:04:51):**  of their farms.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:04:53):**  Together this last year we organized a really unique conference in Germany with the Besch  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:04:57):**  organization at the Farmers' Castle in Schwabisch Hall, and I got to meet some of my heroes  
**[0:05:02-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:05:02):**  in the regenerative ag world while we worked to write a manifesto on the future of regenerative  
**[0:05:07-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:05:07):**  agriculture in Europe, based on outcomes and results to help guide agricultural policy  
**[0:05:13-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:05:13):**  across the continent.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:05:15):**  In another big win this year, our transition finance and tech team are nearing the launch  
**[0:05:19-0:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:05:19):**  of what are likely the highest quality carbon credits on the market, based on multiple ecosystem  
**[0:05:25-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:05:25):**  health indicators that go far beyond just carbon sequestered, and use open source satellite  
**[0:05:29-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:05:29):**  monitoring technology for verifiable and transparent results.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:05:34):**  They've also been working to create collaborations with other actors in the ag tech space in  
**[0:05:38-0:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:05:38):**  order to collaborate, share resources, and accelerate the movement towards a truly regenerative  
**[0:05:43-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:05:43):**  future for farming that rewards best practices for local ecosystems, economies, and the health  
**[0:05:48-0:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:05:48):**  of farmers and their businesses rather than incentivizing destructive practices the way  
**[0:05:52-0:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:05:52):**  the current subsidy system does.  
**[0:05:55-0:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:05:55):**  I also want to give a special shout out to the incredible farmers that I've gotten to  
**[0:05:59-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:05:59):**  work with in our pioneer programs this last year.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:06:02):**  To Joao, Francisco, Manuel, Carlo and Coralee, Michel, Hannes, Dobiemar, Josephine, Alessandro,  
**[0:06:10-0:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:06:10):**  Juan Pablo, Henry, Torbjorn, and David for all of your incredible efforts to steward  
**[0:06:16-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:06:16):**  your land and improve the health and biodiversity while managing a farm business in such challenging  
**[0:06:21-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:06:21):**  times.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:06:22):**  It's nothing short of heroic the work that you do, really, and I feel so fortunate and  
**[0:06:27-0:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:06:27):**  so nervous for the huge tasks ahead, but I know that with such a talented and dedicated  
**[0:06:32-0:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:06:32):**  group of people that we'll be able to accomplish amazing things.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:06:36):**  In fact, our CEO, Ivo Deggen, put out a great little end of the year Christmas greeting  
**[0:06:41-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:06:41):**  on our Instagram page to talk about some of what we've accomplished in the last year with  
**[0:06:44-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:06:44):**  a clip from the whole team at the end, so check that out if you have time.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:06:48):**  I'll put a link in the show notes.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:06:51):**  Now along these same lines, if you're working in agriculture or ecological restoration of  
**[0:06:57-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:06:57):**  any kind, anywhere in Europe especially, be sure to stay tuned throughout the upcoming  
**[0:07:01-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:07:01):**  year because I've got some exciting opportunities and resources that are in development and  
**[0:07:05-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:07:05):**  will be coming out soon.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:07:07):**  One example that I can already reveal is that I can now help pretty much anyone on the continent  
**[0:07:12-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:07:12):**  who is working on reforestation, at pretty much any scale, to get free trees and planting  
**[0:07:18-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:07:18):**  assistance.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:07:19):**  But don't worry, I'll give the details about this at the end of this episode.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:07:23):**  Now another aspect of my work that has been an absolute joy has been working with new  
**[0:07:27-0:07:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:07:27):**  society publishers.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:07:28):**  Now they've been the sponsor of this podcast since long before I ever had a following,  
**[0:07:33-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:07:33):**  and they believed in the quality of the information and interviews enough to stick with me as  
**[0:07:37-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:07:37):**  this show has slowly grown.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:07:39):**  They're such a unique company in the world of publishing because they're only a small  
**[0:07:43-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:07:43):**  group of dedicated people gathered on little Gabriola Island off the coast of Western Canada  
**[0:07:48-0:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:07:48):**  who are committed to publishing the books that will help to build a better world.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:07:53):**  And I was fortunate enough to visit with them shortly before I moved to Spain and I got  
**[0:07:56-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:07:56):**  to meet them in person.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:07:58):**  They all live the lifestyles that they promote in their books, from growing their own food  
**[0:08:02-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:08:02):**  and gardens and their individual homesteads, to capturing rainwater and working in the  
**[0:08:07-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:08:07):**  community, all the way to the ethics of the business itself, which is owned by the employees,  
**[0:08:13-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:08:13):**  and even the books are only printed on post-consumer recycled paper produced entirely in North  
**[0:08:18-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:08:18):**  America.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:08:19):**  I was so inspired by their way of doing business that I made a little documentary of what I  
**[0:08:23-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:08:23):**  learned, which you can also find on their website.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:08:26):**  Now, there is one more big piece of news that I've been holding close to my chest this last  
**[0:08:31-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:08:31):**  couple of months, but things are finally looking good enough that I can share it with all of  
**[0:08:35-0:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:08:35):**  you.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:08:36):**  Now, back in October, my partner Alba and I put a reserve payment down on a property  
**[0:08:43-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:08:43):**  after over two years of constant searching.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:08:45):**  She and I have been looking for a place where we could bring our families together and provide  
**[0:08:49-0:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:08:49):**  for ourselves and our community since we decided to give our relationship a go and I moved  
**[0:08:54-0:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:08:54):**  to Spain back in August of 2019.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:08:56):**  Now, of course, so many things have come up in that time that threaten to derail our dream,  
**[0:09:02-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:09:02):**  not the least of which was the pandemic that tanked our chances at a house that we tried  
**[0:09:05-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:09:05):**  for literally in February of 2020, right before the lockdowns.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:09:10):**  But thanks in large part to our mutual support of one another and so much encouragement from  
**[0:09:14-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:09:14):**  our families, we continued to save everything that we could until we finally had enough  
**[0:09:19-0:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:09:19):**  to put down a down payment.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:09:21):**  Now, this will be a lifelong project with a lot of potential that will unfold in the  
**[0:09:25-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:09:25):**  years ahead.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:09:26):**  And together, we want to bring you along in this journey of learning and collaboration.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:09:31):**  So I'll be publishing as many of the steps in this process as I can find time for.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:09:36):**  We're in a really unique situation at the moment where we reserve the place, but we  
**[0:09:41-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:09:41):**  haven't bought it just yet.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:09:43):**  It's kind of weird in other places that I've heard of how you buy properties, but it's  
**[0:09:47-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:09:47):**  fairly common here in Spain.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:09:50):**  This is one of the larger challenges that we have in the short term, since we will need  
**[0:09:54-0:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:09:54):**  to navigate the financing before our deadline of October the 12th.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:09:58):**  We're currently looking into all of the financial aid and subsidy options that exist in Europe,  
**[0:10:03-0:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:10:03):**  as well as building our business plans in order to look for a loan and possibly even  
**[0:10:07-0:10:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:10:07):**  investment.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:10:08):**  Now, even though I have quite a bit of experience with ecological projects by now, business  
**[0:10:14-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:10:14):**  and finance is really new for me, and I'm looking for all the help that I can get.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:10:19):**  Though that of course is a very necessary part of the process, I am most excited of  
**[0:10:24-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:10:24):**  course about the projects and designs that I'll be planning in the coming months for  
**[0:10:28-0:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:10:28):**  the house and for the 3 hectares of land surrounding it.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:10:32):**  So let's talk first about the building because it's quite unique.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:10:35):**  Quickly before I get started with this description, if you're the type of person who needs to  
**[0:10:39-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:10:39):**  see pictures for these descriptions to make sense, you can follow along with the upcoming  
**[0:10:43-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:10:43):**  descriptions with the pictures on the Regenerative Skills Instagram account because I've just  
**[0:10:47-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:10:47):**  made a post there that should help this all make more sense.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:10:50):**  So let's go!  
**[0:10:51-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:10:51):**  Okay, so when we were searching real estate listings online, the first thing that stood  
**[0:10:56-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:10:56):**  out about this place was the little stone bridge that crosses the river to the house.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:11:01):**  It turns out that both the bridge and the original building of the house are over 1000  
**[0:11:06-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:11:06):**  years old.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:11:07):**  They were built during Roman times and the earliest records of the place date back to  
**[0:11:11-0:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:11:11):**  the year 937.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:11:14):**  A lot of you who have lived in Europe all your lives are probably thinking, yeah it's  
**[0:11:17-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:11:17):**  no big deal, there are old buildings and castles scattered all over the place here.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:11:22):**  But for me, having grown up mostly in the US and living in countries that don't have  
**[0:11:26-0:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:11:26):**  as much old architecture, I was floored by this.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:11:30):**  Now for most of its life, this building functioned as a mill, which is where it gets its name,  
**[0:11:34-0:11:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:11:34):**  Molide Bujons.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:11:36):**  We believe that it was in the 60s or 70s when the mill wheel was removed and the renovations  
**[0:11:41-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:11:41):**  began.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:11:42):**  Since then, there were two annexes added to the main structure.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:11:45):**  There's a large dining hall which was used as a restaurant space until about 3 years  
**[0:11:48-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:11:48):**  ago, and an addition to the living space on the north side.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:11:52):**  Now the building has been quite well maintained and it has been continuously inhabited until  
**[0:11:57-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:11:57):**  recently.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:11:58):**  The thick stone walls of the original structure and the more recent additions are totally  
**[0:12:03-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:12:03):**  stable.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:12:05):**  So far as we can tell, there's only one structural issue which is a rotted vega or  
**[0:12:09-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:12:09):**  support beam in the cavernous basement.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:12:12):**  And we're looking at it with a structural engineer and this is probably one of the first  
**[0:12:15-0:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:12:15):**  renovation projects that we'll be looking to work on.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:12:18):**  The trick is that the valley in which the property sits in is one of the coldest little  
**[0:12:22-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:12:22):**  microclimates in all of Catalunya.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:12:25):**  Nighttime winter temperatures have already reached minus 7 degrees Celsius this December,  
**[0:12:30-0:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:12:30):**  and I've heard of it getting as low as minus 15, which is only 5 degrees Fahrenheit.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:12:36):**  And while that's nothing for Minnesota where I spent most of my adolescence, it's quite  
**[0:12:41-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:12:41):**  something for an area where it's rare for temperatures to drop below freezing.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:12:45):**  Now because this building is so old, weatherproofing and insulation will likely be a big priority,  
**[0:12:51-0:12:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:12:51):**  as will sustainable heating and power options since the house currently has an antiquated  
**[0:12:55-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:12:55):**  gas oil central heating system.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:12:58):**  The big advantage of the house is that there's a lot of space.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:13:02):**  Because the site has been run as a hostel for many years, there are enough rooms and  
**[0:13:05-0:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:13:05):**  bathrooms to run a rural tourism business once we're able to get through all of the  
**[0:13:09-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:13:09):**  necessary renovations.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:13:15):**  The dining hall has great potential as an event and a teaching space, as do the grounds  
**[0:13:19-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:13:19):**  outside with access to the little waterfall and the swimming area in the river.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:13:25):**  My partner's big dream in the beginning is to renovate the entrance and old kitchen  
**[0:13:29-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:13:29):**  at the front of the building into an agrobotiga, or a farm store.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:13:34):**  She has an amazing aesthetic eye since she has worked as a graphic designer for a long  
**[0:13:38-0:13:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:13:38):**  time and is behind many of our town's holiday posters and event promotions.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:13:43):**  She's already planning how to organize everything and make it beautiful and inviting, which  
**[0:13:46-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:13:46):**  is great because I like to build stuff but I'm not nearly as focused on that stuff.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:13:51):**  Now together we're already making plans to connect with local growers and producers  
**[0:13:55-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:13:55):**  to offer their products in the community since there are no other general goods stores for  
**[0:13:59-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:13:59):**  at least a 15 minute drive around us.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:14:03):**  Now we've heard from the neighbors that the previous owners used to sell food from  
**[0:14:06-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:14:06):**  their garden and did quite well since there are two campgrounds and a little neighborhood  
**[0:14:10-0:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:14:10):**  of houses that really enjoy the convenience of that location.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:14:15):**  Ever since we put down the reserve payment I've been doing tons of research and I began  
**[0:14:20-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:14:20):**  building a 3D model of the house based on the plans that we have, which I plan to play  
**[0:14:24-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:14:24):**  around with as we come up with ideas for the configuration of the store and the other rooms,  
**[0:14:29-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:14:29):**  and I've included a snapshot of the model in the pictures as well.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:14:33):**  I of course intend to use natural and locally sourced materials in every application that  
**[0:14:38-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:14:38):**  I can, and I plan to work with natural building schools and teachers from this area, as well  
**[0:14:42-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:14:42):**  as drawing from my own experience from working with earthen materials in the US and Ecuador,  
**[0:14:47-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:14:47):**  the Philippines, Senegal, and Guatemala to steward this beautiful historic building for  
**[0:14:51-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:14:51):**  the generations after us.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:14:53):**  Alright, now let's talk about the land around the building itself.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:14:58):**  So the house is situated on the edge of La Riera Major, a small tributary of the River  
**[0:15:04-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:15:04):**  Terre, which winds its way up to Girona and out to the Mediterranean.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:15:09):**  The water catchment comes mostly from the Moncey National Park, which is just south  
**[0:15:13-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:15:13):**  of us, and that means that the water is remarkably clean compared to other waterways in the region.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:15:19):**  Now while the mill was functioning back in the day, the previous owners also ran a small  
**[0:15:23-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:15:23):**  fishery, both of which were fed by a series of old dams.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:15:27):**  But back in 2018, when the Catalan Water Authority was rehabilitating these waterways, they removed  
**[0:15:33-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:15:33):**  all of the dams in order to help the fish gain access to higher waters for spawning  
**[0:15:38-0:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:15:38):**  upstream.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:15:39):**  Now, though I certainly support this effort, in the following years, tons of sediment were  
**[0:15:44-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:15:44):**  washed downstream and a major storm in 2020 further eroded the riverbanks to the point  
**[0:15:50-0:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:15:50):**  where now the water level is a couple of meters lower than it has been for over a thousand  
**[0:15:54-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:15:54):**  years.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:15:56):**  Many of the trees that were planted along the banks dried out as a result and died,  
**[0:16:01-0:16:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:16:01):**  which seems to be destabilizing the edges even further.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:16:08):**  The three hectares of the land included in the purchase are not one continuous parcel.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:16:14):**  The original land has been subdivided and parceled out among family inheritances for  
**[0:16:18-0:16:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:16:18):**  some time and so the portions that are now coming with the house are actually seven mostly  
**[0:16:24-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:16:24):**  discontinuous plots.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:16:27):**  And the one along the river to the north is where the trees are drying out.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:16:33):**  The largest plot is along the southern bank of the river below the house.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:16:37):**  You can see all of this on the base map in the pictures.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:16:41):**  And that parcel is about 1.5 hectares of flood zone pasture.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:16:46):**  In the past, they grew poplar trees there on about a 20-year rotation for lumber, but  
**[0:16:51-0:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:16:51):**  the trees have long since been harvested and the soil left there is essentially just river  
**[0:16:55-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:16:55):**  sand and sediment.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:16:57):**  My initial idea is to plant a very dense orchard of traditional fruit trees, bushes, and perennial  
**[0:17:03-0:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:17:03):**  species, but I'm still gathering information and I don't want to jump to any conclusions  
**[0:17:06-0:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:17:06):**  before my research is done.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:17:15):**  The next largest parcel is directly above the house on a very steep and rocky slope.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:17:20):**  On that slope, there are mostly home oak trees or ensina and because of its southern exposure  
**[0:17:26-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:17:26):**  and the higher elevation from where the house is, this may become a site for photovoltaic  
**[0:17:31-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:17:31):**  installation in the future since it doesn't have much potential for cultivation because  
**[0:17:35-0:17:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:17:35):**  of the angle and the panels could be raised and the existing trees allowed to grow with  
**[0:17:40-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:17:40):**  kind of only occasional pollarding so that they don't need to block the panels but also  
**[0:17:44-0:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:17:44):**  don't need to be killed.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:17:46):**  The logs could then be used to grow mushrooms, chipped for mulch, or used as fuel wood.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:17:51):**  Now the last parcel of interest is a funky little triangle above the road that runs along  
**[0:17:55-0:17:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:17:55):**  the north side of the river above the house.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:17:58):**  This was used as a garden space by many previous owners and it is divided into I think 3 or  
**[0:18:03-0:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:18:03):**  4 terraces?  
**[0:18:04-0:18:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:18:04):**  I can't really tell for sure yet because the plot is so overgrown with brambles and  
**[0:18:08-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:18:08):**  brush that I can't even see the terraces anymore.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:18:11):**  A few struggling fruit trees are still there but are definitely in need of some love.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:18:15):**  In the short term, I'm probably looking at planting a tree nursery there, since I'll  
**[0:18:20-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:18:20):**  need a lot of trees and shrubs for the habitat restoration projects along the river, and  
**[0:18:24-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:18:24):**  I'll likely need to plant a significant line of hedgerows and living fences around  
**[0:18:27-0:18:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:18:27):**  the various plots to keep wild boar and deer at bay while the fruit trees and the perennials  
**[0:18:32-0:18:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:18:32):**  get established.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:18:34):**  Eventually this will likely be the site of the main veggie garden because it's out  
**[0:18:38-0:18:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:18:38):**  of the floodplain and has ideal southern exposure.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:18:41):**  So those are some of the particulars of the site itself.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:18:44):**  For those of you who are interested in following along the design and development process,  
**[0:18:48-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:18:48):**  let me give you an idea of the major factors and data of the area.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:18:53):**  So one of the reasons why I'm going into such detail in explaining all of this is because  
**[0:18:57-0:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:18:57):**  I'm now going into the third season of teaching the last module of the Ecosystem Restoration  
**[0:19:01-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:19:01):**  Design course run by Gaia Education Online.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:19:05):**  And in my process of designing for the site, I'm going through my own design process  
**[0:19:09-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:19:09):**  so that my students can see that I really do use this process for myself and my clients,  
**[0:19:14-0:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:19:14):**  and I'm not just teaching them things to do for the sake of doing it.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:19:18):**  And there are still a lot of the pieces that I'm putting together, I'm still in the  
**[0:19:20-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:19:20):**  early stages of research, but I'll start from the top.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:19:24):**  So the community of Bruges is situated in eastern central Catalunya near the historic  
**[0:19:29-0:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:19:29):**  city of Vic in the county of Usona.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:19:32):**  This area has a long agricultural history, mostly of growing grains and raising pigs.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:19:38):**  The area around us is all forested mountains, which are part of the pre-coastal range.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:19:42):**  There isn't a lot of agriculture specifically in our area, though there are some small orchards,  
**[0:19:48-0:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:19:48):**  and the town to the east of us is the most famous in Catalunya for growing Christmas  
**[0:19:52-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:19:52):**  trees.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:19:53):**  The community sits in between two protected natural parks, or Espaes Naturales, of the  
**[0:19:58-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:19:58):**  UNESCO Biosphere site of the Moncén and Las Guirillas y Savasona, the second of which  
**[0:20:04-0:20:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:20:04):**  begins just across the bridge from the house.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:20:07):**  Now I encourage you to look up both places because they're spectacular and are home  
**[0:20:11-0:20:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:20:11):**  to some incredible wildlife, and I'll share some links in the show notes.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:20:16):**  So though most people associate Catalunya with the Mediterranean climate of Barcelona  
**[0:20:20-0:20:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:20:20):**  and both the Costa Brava and the Costa del Sol, which isn't wrong, the interior is  
**[0:20:25-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:20:25):**  actually a CFB classification on the Kappengiger map, making it a temperate oceanic climate.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:20:32):**  The frost dates here put the land somewhere in the 7B to 8A area of the hardiness zones,  
**[0:20:38-0:20:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:20:38):**  and the microclimate makes the house quite cold in the winter because of its low situation  
**[0:20:42-0:20:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:20:42):**  in the valley, which means it loses the sun quite early.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:20:45):**  I've even heard from the neighbors that live just a little bit higher above that there  
**[0:20:49-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:20:49):**  can be a difference of 5 degrees Celsius between their place and ours.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:20:54):**  Now we traditionally average about 650 millimeters of rain a year, but this is an erratic average  
**[0:20:59-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:20:59):**  at best.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:21:00):**  For example, 2020 got over 800 millimeters, and this year we won't likely reach 500.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:21:08):**  The soil on site is looking like it will be one of the primary challenges.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:21:12):**  It's almost completely sand.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:21:14):**  Now that's not just in our area down in the river Flood Valley, but all around us,  
**[0:21:19-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:21:19):**  and I know this because there are three active sand and gravel mines within walking distance  
**[0:21:23-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:21:23):**  of the house.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:21:25):**  I'm not sure exactly what the mineral composition yet, it's one of the things I've got on  
**[0:21:28-0:21:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:21:28):**  my list to figure out.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:21:29):**  I've also taken a number of soil samples already and have been using the microbio-meter  
**[0:21:34-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:21:34):**  to measure microbial levels and bacteria to fungi ratios as well.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:21:39):**  At the moment, those levels look to be quite low, and so making compost and adding organic  
**[0:21:44-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:21:44):**  matter along with adding bioinoculants will probably be a big part of early development  
**[0:21:49-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:21:49):**  projects on the land.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:21:51):**  I've also been putting a lot of time into creating sitemaps for the base of the design  
**[0:21:54-0:21:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:21:54):**  that I'll be developing along with the business plans.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:21:58):**  The fact is that it's just far too big of a property to be a simple homestead, and both  
**[0:22:03-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:22:03):**  my partner and I feel inspired to do something that really involves the local community and  
**[0:22:07-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:22:07):**  helps to promote education and the advancement of the regenerative movement in our area.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:22:12):**  Now fortunately, Catalunya has many incredible companies and organizations that we're in  
**[0:22:17-0:22:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:22:17):**  the process of partnering with that promote local and traditional production, land management,  
**[0:22:22-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:22:22):**  and ecological restoration.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:22:24):**  Much more than trying to be the leaders and innovators in this field, I'm motivated to  
**[0:22:28-0:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:22:28):**  play a supporting role and to dedicate our efforts to assisting those working at a larger  
**[0:22:32-0:22:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:22:32):**  scale and welcoming newcomers into these projects as well.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:22:37):**  Now the history of this place that we'll be stewarding has really helped to confirm the  
**[0:22:42-0:22:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:22:42):**  ideas that I've long held about the concept of ownership.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:22:45):**  This place has housed and nourished so many generations before me, and so long as I don't  
**[0:22:50-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:22:50):**  destroy what has been built and cared for, it will hopefully do the same for many generations  
**[0:22:55-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:22:55):**  after me.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:22:57):**  So how can I say that I ever own this place, even after the mortgage has paid off?  
**[0:23:02-0:23:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:23:02):**  If anything outlives you or has existed long before you, can you really say that you own  
**[0:23:07-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:23:07):**  it?  
**[0:23:08-0:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:23:08):**  At best we'll be paying for access, and knowing this really makes it sink in for me that we  
**[0:23:13-0:23:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:23:13):**  have a profound responsibility to care for the legacy of this place, to leave it better  
**[0:23:17-0:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:23:17):**  than we found it, and to pass it on to others who are committed to doing the same.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:23:24):**  Now I have painted a pretty rosy picture of the site and the building up until now, partly  
**[0:23:28-0:23:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:23:28):**  because I'm completely in love with it, but it's important to acknowledge that every site  
**[0:23:33-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:23:33):**  has its challenges.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:23:34):**  I kind of glossed over the sandy soil situation and the low light access in the valley coupled  
**[0:23:39-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:23:39):**  with low temperatures, but these might turn out to be quite limiting factors for what  
**[0:23:43-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:23:43):**  we can grow there.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:23:44):**  The financial situation is something that I've probably downplayed as well, given the  
**[0:23:48-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:23:48):**  fact that we spent all of our life savings on the down payment and will need a lot of  
**[0:23:52-0:23:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:23:52):**  luck and hard work if we're to finalize the purchase.  
**[0:23:56-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:23:56):**  All of the clients that I've ever worked with have voiced concerns over not having enough  
**[0:24:00-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:24:00):**  financial capital to realize what they want in the time that they want, even the wealthiest  
**[0:24:05-0:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:24:05):**  ones, so I'm going to do my best to not fall into that trap of thinking.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:24:10):**  I know from experience that a lack of financial capital can be overcome with abundant capital  
**[0:24:15-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:24:15):**  in other forms, abundant creativity and patience.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:24:19):**  So I'll be relying heavily on these resources instead of always trying to solve challenges  
**[0:24:23-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:24:23):**  with money.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:24:24):**  There are also a lot of tight restrictions on what we can build and how we can renovate  
**[0:24:28-0:24:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:24:28):**  the building because of its historical registration, and this could also prove to be a big limitation.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:24:34):**  The forest and the river around us also present some real challenges, I told you that a lot  
**[0:24:38-0:24:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:24:38):**  of the land is within a flood zone, and I believe that the 100 year flood predictions  
**[0:24:43-0:24:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:24:43):**  even include the area of the house itself.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:24:46):**  The forest, being as dense as it is, depending on how it's managed, could also really prove  
**[0:24:51-0:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:24:51):**  to be a fire risk.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:24:52):**  There have been a lot of wildfires in nearby areas in Catalunya in previous years, and  
**[0:24:58-0:25:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:24:58):**  so forestry management is going to be a real challenge, especially because I don't have  
**[0:25:02-0:25:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:25:02):**  access to most of it.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:25:04):**  That same forest and the river also has problems with invasive species, which I say in quotes,  
**[0:25:09-0:25:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:25:09):**  because I don't really share the perspective of many of the government agencies that those  
**[0:25:13-0:25:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:25:13):**  species need to be eradicated, the way they're currently trying to do by injecting poisons  
**[0:25:18-0:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:25:18):**  into the hardy black locust trees that pop up everywhere.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:25:21):**  It's certainly going to be something that we need to manage, probably for the rest of  
**[0:25:24-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:25:24):**  our lives though.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:25:26):**  Now in my case, the language is also going to be a big part of my learning curve.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:25:30):**  Though I feel quite competent in Spanish, the interior of Catalunya is where there is  
**[0:25:34-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:25:34):**  a very strong separatist movement to secede from the rest of Spain, and people are very  
**[0:25:39-0:25:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:25:39):**  adamant about speaking Catalan, even though they all speak Spanish as well.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:25:44):**  I have a lot of respect for these efforts to preserve especially regional languages,  
**[0:25:47-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:25:47):**  and certainly sympathize with this sentiment due to all of the repression from the government  
**[0:25:51-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:25:51):**  in Madrid in recent history, and so I plan to make a real effort to learn the language.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:25:56):**  The simple truth of being a foreigner puts a big responsibility on me to take the time  
**[0:26:00-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:26:00):**  to learn and adapt to the culture and the social expectations of my new home.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:26:05):**  Though this is a responsibility that I fully embrace, it doesn't really make it any easier.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:26:10):**  Luckily though, I've been working hard on this for the last two and a half years since  
**[0:26:13-0:26:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:26:13):**  I've been here, and I've made some real progress, but this year I'm really going to treat it  
**[0:26:17-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:26:17):**  as a job.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:26:18):**  I've lived in other countries where immigrants like myself, especially those in privileged  
**[0:26:22-0:26:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:26:22):**  positions who often refer to themselves as expats, have lived in a place for decades  
**[0:26:27-0:26:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:26:27):**  with no effort towards assimilating or learning to communicate, and I'm determined not to  
**[0:26:31-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:26:31):**  be that type of traveler.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:26:33):**  As much as a personal passion project, this is going to be a journey of growth and community  
**[0:26:37-0:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:26:37):**  integration for me.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:26:39):**  From a lifetime of travel, I've learned over and over again that the best way to effectively  
**[0:26:43-0:26:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:26:43):**  contribute to the place where you reside is to work to deeply understand the nuances of  
**[0:26:48-0:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:26:48):**  the story of the place where you are, and the people who are sharing that place with  
**[0:26:52-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:26:52):**  you.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:26:54):**  So with that, I invite you to come with me on this journey.  
**[0:26:57-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:26:57):**  Up until now, this podcast has mostly focused on the interviews that I've done with people  
**[0:27:01-0:27:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:27:01):**  whose work and ideas have inspired me, and that I've been learning from.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:27:05):**  And though these interviews will still be a big part of the show, I'll also be sharing  
**[0:27:09-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:27:09):**  the journey of design, learning, and development that I'll be going through on this new project,  
**[0:27:15-0:27:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:27:15):**  much like the first two seasons when I was building the little homestead with my friends  
**[0:27:18-0:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:27:18):**  Neil and Jeremy in Guatemala.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:27:21):**  Though my main work since this show began has been to help to design and build these  
**[0:27:25-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:27:25):**  types of projects for others, and I've learned a lot and gained valuable experiences in the  
**[0:27:29-0:27:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:27:29):**  process, there is always something new to learn, and unexpected challenges along the  
**[0:27:35-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:27:35):**  way.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:27:36):**  I'll also be sharing pictures and videos on the Regenerative Skills social media accounts  
**[0:27:40-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:27:40):**  whenever I can make time to do that so you can follow along with me.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:27:44):**  And if you're a member of the Discord channel, you'll also get to see a lot more of the personal  
**[0:27:48-0:27:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/getting-ready-for-another-year-of-regeneration-season-5-finale/#t=0:27:48):**  and private side of this journey that I'm just not as comfortable sharing with the general

**[0:05:37-0:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-reality-of-natural-building-and-designing-for-your-climate-with-ziggy-liloia-from-the-year-of-mud-086/#t=0:05:37):**  taking a big interest right from the get-go once I had the opportunity to work with some

**[0:05:52-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-reality-of-natural-building-and-designing-for-your-climate-with-ziggy-liloia-from-the-year-of-mud-086/#t=0:05:52):**  But it was originally there in Missouri where I made some friends, community members who  
**[0:06:00-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-reality-of-natural-building-and-designing-for-your-climate-with-ziggy-liloia-from-the-year-of-mud-086/#t=0:06:00):**  were building and just sort of got experience as I went along.

**[0:06:21-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-reality-of-natural-building-and-designing-for-your-climate-with-ziggy-liloia-from-the-year-of-mud-086/#t=0:06:21):**  But we'll probably get to that later.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-reality-of-natural-building-and-designing-for-your-climate-with-ziggy-liloia-from-the-year-of-mud-086/#t=0:06:25):**  At the time, this was, I guess, let's see, 2007, 2008, which doesn't sound like a long  
**[0:06:32-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-reality-of-natural-building-and-designing-for-your-climate-with-ziggy-liloia-from-the-year-of-mud-086/#t=0:06:32):**  time ago.

**[0:06:39-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-reality-of-natural-building-and-designing-for-your-climate-with-ziggy-liloia-from-the-year-of-mud-086/#t=0:06:39):**  that information is available and information is communicated, the literature available,  
**[0:06:46-0:06:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-reality-of-natural-building-and-designing-for-your-climate-with-ziggy-liloia-from-the-year-of-mud-086/#t=0:06:46):**  et cetera.

**[0:06:54-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-reality-of-natural-building-and-designing-for-your-climate-with-ziggy-liloia-from-the-year-of-mud-086/#t=0:06:54):**  low and the accessibility because as I said earlier, I didn't have any carpentry experience,  
**[0:07:01-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-reality-of-natural-building-and-designing-for-your-climate-with-ziggy-liloia-from-the-year-of-mud-086/#t=0:07:01):**  any real construction experience of any kind.

**[0:07:07-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-reality-of-natural-building-and-designing-for-your-climate-with-ziggy-liloia-from-the-year-of-mud-086/#t=0:07:07):**  I should probably look into doing this because I don't have the skills, I don't have the  
**[0:07:13-0:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-reality-of-natural-building-and-designing-for-your-climate-with-ziggy-liloia-from-the-year-of-mud-086/#t=0:07:13):**  financial resources to do something more complicated.

**[0:07:23-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-reality-of-natural-building-and-designing-for-your-climate-with-ziggy-liloia-from-the-year-of-mud-086/#t=0:07:23):**  definitely ignored quite a few other important aspects of Cobb as a building material, especially  
**[0:07:32-0:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-reality-of-natural-building-and-designing-for-your-climate-with-ziggy-liloia-from-the-year-of-mud-086/#t=0:07:32):**  in that climate.

**[0:07:40-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-reality-of-natural-building-and-designing-for-your-climate-with-ziggy-liloia-from-the-year-of-mud-086/#t=0:07:40):**  well and then selecting the correct material for your climate and context.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-reality-of-natural-building-and-designing-for-your-climate-with-ziggy-liloia-from-the-year-of-mud-086/#t=0:07:45):**  So let's break down the steps that you went through as you were evaluating the materials  
**[0:07:51-0:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-reality-of-natural-building-and-designing-for-your-climate-with-ziggy-liloia-from-the-year-of-mud-086/#t=0:07:51):**  that you had on hand.

**[0:07:58-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-reality-of-natural-building-and-designing-for-your-climate-with-ziggy-liloia-from-the-year-of-mud-086/#t=0:07:58):**  Tell us a little bit about the structure itself, the dimensions and what it included and some  
**[0:08:04-0:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-reality-of-natural-building-and-designing-for-your-climate-with-ziggy-liloia-from-the-year-of-mud-086/#t=0:08:04):**  of the main things that you learned while building it.

**[0:08:12-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-reality-of-natural-building-and-designing-for-your-climate-with-ziggy-liloia-from-the-year-of-mud-086/#t=0:08:12):**  It was under, well, around, say 200 square feet.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-reality-of-natural-building-and-designing-for-your-climate-with-ziggy-liloia-from-the-year-of-mud-086/#t=0:08:19):**  Basically it was a bedroom, a glorified bedroom.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-reality-of-natural-building-and-designing-for-your-climate-with-ziggy-liloia-from-the-year-of-mud-086/#t=0:08:21):**  There was no kitchen, no bathroom, no even electric facilities or functions.

**[0:08:44-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-reality-of-natural-building-and-designing-for-your-climate-with-ziggy-liloia-from-the-year-of-mud-086/#t=0:08:44):**  and also at the time, my kind of sky high idealism that I was going to live without  
**[0:08:50-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-reality-of-natural-building-and-designing-for-your-climate-with-ziggy-liloia-from-the-year-of-mud-086/#t=0:08:50):**  electricity in my house and try to do everything as basically as possible.

**[0:09:05-0:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-reality-of-natural-building-and-designing-for-your-climate-with-ziggy-liloia-from-the-year-of-mud-086/#t=0:09:05):**  And the, what was your other question?

**[0:09:25-0:09:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-reality-of-natural-building-and-designing-for-your-climate-with-ziggy-liloia-from-the-year-of-mud-086/#t=0:09:25):**  Sure.

**[0:26:33-0:26:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:26:33):**  these the three big general problems in the annual areas here in Brazil is the soil compaction,  
**[0:26:43-0:26:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:26:43):**  the nematode population, and also the root disease.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:26:46):**  This is the three big challenges that we are in general now.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:26:50):**  But when we look for these, the ecosystem, very well developed using cover crops, increasing

**[0:27:05-0:27:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:27:05):**  the needs of the, the promoted biodiversity with different species, different root as

**[0:27:16-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:27:16):**  I think that is the point, for example, for annual crops in Brazil, we have a, if you  
**[0:27:23-0:27:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:27:23):**  go in general areas, so in general evaluation, our, our average of the soybean grain is not  
**[0:27:30-0:27:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:27:30):**  so high, but it is around 3.2 tons per hectare.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:27:37):**  But you have very good farmers that I visited just now here in the zoo.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:27:41):**  They in this morning, so that farm that they're using for 20, 30 years work with the biodiversity  
**[0:27:49-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:27:49):**  using different species to take into account the nutrients into the soil, looking forward  
**[0:27:55-0:28:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:27:55):**  to improve as more as more the biological approach, the, the, the attributes of the  
**[0:28:00-0:28:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:28:00):**  biological aspects.

**[0:28:08-0:28:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:28:08):**  So I think that the, like I said, at the beginning, the, these are real diagnostic or diagnosis  
**[0:28:16-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:28:16):**  within all aspects, all contests is very important because you have some areas that the people  
**[0:28:23-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:28:23):**  are doing, like we got more than 20, 30, 40, 50 years and it makes it all is a lot of chemical  
**[0:28:30-0:28:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:28:30):**  nutrients, but the problem is the equilibrium of nutrients.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:28:33):**  We have many of them that we, 200 parts per million, 300 parts per million of potassium  
**[0:28:40-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:28:40):**  and potassium 116, the power of sanitization.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:28:43):**  So if you put more, you, you, you cook the roots of the bean or the crops.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:28:49):**  So the important point is also to check this and improve biodiversity, which biodiversity,  
**[0:28:56-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:28:56):**  which species that you can add with biological products, biological approach of the, the  
**[0:29:02-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:29:02):**  organ is that you can increase during this year using many areas, this pesticide.

**[0:29:10-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:29:10):**  Many times we have a physical problem and this happened.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:29:13):**  They in animal area, they buy a very good equipment with like a chisel, very strong

**[0:29:22-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:29:22):**  I'm not using more.

**[0:36:19-0:36:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:36:19):**  Look, if you know how your body works, very simply, your body is self healing, self organizing,

**[0:39:58-0:40:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:39:58):**  I look at the three free things of farming, which is the sun, rain and carbon dioxide.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:40:04):**  You take those three free things, I put them through my catalyst, which is soil and I make

**[0:40:16-0:40:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:40:16):**  Everything else is taking money from you and giving it to somebody else to make a profit.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:40:21):**  So for me as a farmer and a farm advisor, it's trying to get back to the absolute basics.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:40:28):**  It's looking at a healthy ecosystem, a healthy soil will provide more money due to the fact  
**[0:40:34-0:40:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:40:34):**  it will convert the sun's energy, the carbon dioxide and the precipitation that falls into  
**[0:40:39-0:40:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:40:39):**  more yield, more profit, because the healthier that soil is, the more I will actually produce  
**[0:40:45-0:40:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:40:45):**  and therefore the more money I earn.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:40:48):**  So I don't know how simple you want to get Ray, but for me, that's really going right  
**[0:40:52-0:40:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:40:52):**  back to basics.  
**[0:40:54-0:40:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:40:54):**  And you know what, it works.  
**[0:40:56-0:41:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:40:56):**  It really does work when you start removing the bolt ons, you know, and it's how we get

**[0:41:07-0:41:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:41:07):**  that with thought, with biomimicry.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:41:09):**  But I think one of the most important concepts in this whole regenerative system is to look  
**[0:41:16-0:41:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:41:16):**  at the things that are provided for us.

**[0:41:21-0:41:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:41:21):**  I want to give my farm to my children in a far better way than my father, unbeknown to

**[0:41:34-0:41:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:41:34):**  It worked and it was great.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:41:36):**  But I talk also about the fact that I believe biology is probably not for me a pure science.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:41:44):**  It's not binary.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:41:46):**  We're not getting on and off and one zeros.  
**[0:41:50-0:41:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:41:50):**  What we're having is a small amount of black area, a small amount of white and a huge amount  
**[0:41:55-0:41:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:41:55):**  of grey.  
**[0:41:56-0:42:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:41:56):**  And it's that huge amount of grey is the reason why our chemicals and physics and everything  
**[0:42:02-0:42:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:42:02):**  we've been doing to it is now not working.

**[0:42:13-0:42:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:42:13):**  There are mutations and these mutations are the things that we're finally realizing why  
**[0:42:19-0:42:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:42:19):**  unfortunately most of the things we've tried in the past, certainly in the last hundred  
**[0:42:25-0:42:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:42:25):**  years, are now becoming really problematic.  
**[0:42:28-0:42:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:42:28):**  So it's basically scrolling through literature that I do in the UK from the 1850s up until  
**[0:42:34-0:42:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:42:34):**  about the 1920s and relearning I guess if only I could sit down with my great grandfather  
**[0:42:40-0:42:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:42:40):**  and his grandfather and actually start relearning what is essentially an awful lot of things  
**[0:42:49-0:42:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:42:49):**  that then became so much more simple to farm.  
**[0:42:53-0:42:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:42:53):**  So for me, three free things, the further you get away from those three free things,  
**[0:42:59-0:43:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:42:59):**  the more expensive it does and generally the more profit I lose.  
**[0:43:03-0:43:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:43:03):**  Yeah, that's just essential from a business standpoint.  
**[0:43:07-0:43:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:43:07):**  And kind of continuing along with this biodiversity addition vein, there are a lot of new enterprises  
**[0:43:16-0:43:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:43:16):**  that are continually being paired with arable cropping, annual cropping, things like agroforestry  
**[0:43:22-0:43:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:43:22):**  integration with animals, holistic livestock management, even things like cover crops and

**[0:43:33-0:43:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:43:33):**  for additional profits for the business, some are simply to boost the ecological function  
**[0:43:41-0:43:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:43:41):**  of the land.

**[0:43:46-0:43:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:43:46):**  these and the relevance to the context that you can speak from from England?  
**[0:43:50-0:43:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:43:50):**  Okay, that's an absolute ginormous subject from cover crops to agroforestry to livestock.  
**[0:43:57-0:44:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:43:57):**  Should I start with livestock and then we can perhaps go around because I think in actual

**[0:44:07-0:44:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:44:07):**  alone anybody else's, but livestock for me...

**[0:44:20-0:44:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:44:20):**  of integrating this with a fully biological farm that includes all of these elements.  
**[0:44:26-0:44:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:44:26):**  Yeah, okay, I appreciate it.  
**[0:44:29-0:44:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:44:29):**  So for me there is no ecosystem on earth where animals and plants do not coexist and therefore  
**[0:44:41-0:44:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:44:41):**  yet again we talk about biomimicry, looking at nature, that sort of thing and decide that  
**[0:44:46-0:44:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/ray-archuleta-ademir-calegari-and-ben-taylor-davies-discuss-regenerative-arable-farming/#t=0:44:46):**  in actual fact if I want to make my system work then the integration of animals is absolutely

**[0:01:30-0:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:01:30):**  Chris, thank you so much for being here with me today.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:01:34):**  Thank you very much.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:01:35):**  Now, I know we've got a whole lot of questions to get to, so how about we just jump right  
**[0:01:38-0:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:01:38):**  in?  
**[0:01:39-0:01:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:01:39):**  Sounds great.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:01:40):**  All right, so let's start off with the basics.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:01:42):**  Tell me about how you got started in natural building and how it sort of changed your lifestyle  
**[0:01:47-0:01:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:01:47):**  since you began.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:01:49):**  When I was a young teenager, I broke my leg and my dad gave me a copy of Lloyd Kahn's  
**[0:01:55-0:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:01:55):**  Shelter book that was actually made about the time I was born, but it's such a fantastic  
**[0:02:04-0:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:02:04):**  do-it-yourself encouragement sort of a thing, just basically photos and stories of people  
**[0:02:10-0:02:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:02:10):**  all over the world making their own little house, their own little workshop out of whatever  
**[0:02:17-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:02:17):**  was at hand and that was so inspiring.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:02:22):**  I've worn out six copies of that book and I've become friends with Lloyd and published  
**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:02:29):**  a few things in some of his books and he's just been a great inspiration.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:02:33):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:02:34):**  So now, a big part of what you do is you promote sort of freer lifestyles and how people can  
**[0:02:41-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:02:41):**  get off this sort of rat race track through natural building methods and by transforming  
**[0:02:47-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:02:47):**  the options that they use to obtain their goals.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:02:49):**  Can you talk a little bit more about that?  
**[0:02:53-0:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:02:53):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:02:54-0:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:02:54):**  So basically, anytime we sign a lease for an apartment or we sign for a loan for a car  
**[0:03:05-0:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:03:05):**  or agree to take a job that is taking all or most of our time or life energy, that kind  
**[0:03:18-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:03:18):**  of sticks us to a place and that's not all bad.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:03:22):**  It's better than being on the street, absolutely, and it's better than having things be too  
**[0:03:28-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:03:28):**  uncertain but the more that we are able to limit our need to buy into a system that taxes  
**[0:03:41-0:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:03:41):**  us so much, not just the government taxing us but having to have that expensive car and  
**[0:03:50-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:03:50):**  spend that time to commute and buy those clothes to look nice for that job and that cell phone  
**[0:03:56-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:03:56):**  to communicate with everybody because things are so busy, the more we buy into that system,  
**[0:04:03-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:04:03):**  the more we leave out the things we might like to do like go for a walk or go to India  
**[0:04:13-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:04:13):**  or draw a picture or read a book with our kids.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:04:19):**  So I focus on the things you can do with mud instead of with materials you buy from the  
**[0:04:27-0:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:04:27):**  store and try to get people thinking along the lines of what can I do with what I have  
**[0:04:34-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:04:34):**  now?  
**[0:04:35-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:04:35):**  What's going to fire my creativity?  
**[0:04:37-0:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:04:37):**  And maybe it's not perfect, definitely it's not perfect, but maybe it's not even as good  
**[0:04:43-0:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:04:43):**  as something you could pay somebody else who's an expert to do but when I look at the thing  
**[0:04:47-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:04:47):**  I did, there's a certain satisfaction to that.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:04:52):**  So how does natural building fit into sort of opening up your options aside from of course  
**[0:04:58-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:04:58):**  just using what is around you, how else can it free up your life just by reconsidering  
**[0:05:04-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:05:04):**  what's available to you in the physical world?  
**[0:05:08-0:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:05:08):**  Well think in terms of structures, the standard structure for a house that somebody would  
**[0:05:19-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:05:19):**  build for you is a 4x8 sheet of plywood or an 8 foot tall 2x4 or 2x6 or 2x8 and these  
**[0:05:29-0:05:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:05:29):**  are square rectilinear materials that are put into rectilinear buildings and everything  
**[0:05:39-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:05:39):**  we buy is designed to fit into those modules like Legos and when we start saying well what  
**[0:05:49-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:05:49):**  would a house look like that was made out of a tree that was crooked?  
**[0:05:54-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:05:54):**  Then we're sharply veering off of the path and that path is actually a very well maintained  
**[0:06:02-0:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:06:02):**  freeway or tollway I guess because you've got to pay to play but when you veer off into  
**[0:06:09-0:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:06:09):**  the woods as it were, your life changes.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:06:13):**  You start slowing down of course but you start noticing little things and life that's going  
**[0:06:20-0:06:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:06:20):**  by you and the trees and the flowers and the crunch of leaves under your feet and it's  
**[0:06:29-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:06:29):**  a very different path than working with materials that have been highly refined for quick building  
**[0:06:37-0:06:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:06:37):**  and for making things that are all boxes that are more or less the same.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:06:47):**  Now can you give me some examples of stories of people that you've interacted with who've  
**[0:06:51-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:06:51):**  transformed their lives by adopting natural building methods or reconsidering what their  
**[0:06:57-0:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:06:57):**  priorities were?  
**[0:07:00-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:07:00):**  Well an example that's very close to my heart would be my 20 year old daughter.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:07:07):**  She was looking at all of the expenses of going to college.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:07:12):**  She wasn't honestly sure what she wanted to do so it seemed kind of silly to spend the  
**[0:07:18-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:07:18):**  money to go take college classes and stay in a dorm that would be so expensive to maybe  
**[0:07:27-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:07:27):**  go down a dead end street and have to go back and take other classes when she figured out  
**[0:07:32-0:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:07:32):**  what she really wanted to do.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:07:34):**  So she got her general education out of the way at the local community college and built  
**[0:07:41-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:07:41):**  a two story tree house in my backyard out of stuff we had laying around.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:07:47):**  And it's insulated and heated and it has its own composting toilet and its own little kitchen  
**[0:07:54-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:07:54):**  and it looks out over the lake and it sways in the breeze, sometimes alarmingly and it  
**[0:08:02-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:08:02):**  leaks on her head where she hasn't figured out exactly how to seal it but it's hers.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:08:12):**  It's her little space that she's created and she did it for about $2,000 plus lots of help  
**[0:08:22-0:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:08:22):**  from family and friends.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:08:25):**  One apartment would have cost her $300, $400, $700 depending on where she went if she was  
**[0:08:33-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:08:33):**  going to go stay someplace else or she could have just stayed in the house with everybody  
**[0:08:38-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:08:38):**  else but where's the fun in that?  
**[0:08:40-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:08:40):**  So she's gone and had an adventure just creating her own space to be in and it's actually enabled  
**[0:08:50-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:08:50):**  her to think further afield so having decided where the center of the universe is she's

**[0:18:35-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:18:35):**  and now you've got a doorknob and it costs you all of a walk in the woods.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:18:42):**  Exactly, yeah for sure.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:18:45):**  Now let's switch over because I was imagining that a lot of people are quite convinced of  
**[0:18:51-0:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:18:51):**  what you're talking about so can you talk a little bit about how they can get started,  
**[0:18:55-0:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:18:55):**  what are some steps to make these changes that you've been speaking of?  
**[0:19:01-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:19:01):**  Oh well you know what there's a couple of ways to do it.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:19:05):**  You can either do something small and then almost unobtrusive and decide that you're  
**[0:19:16-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:19:16):**  pleased with that and that you're going to use that as a stepping stone to do something  
**[0:19:21-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:19:21):**  else.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:19:22):**  So like for instance if you've got a space you're trying to finish on a wall and you  
**[0:19:29-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:19:29):**  say well I'm not going to go build an earthen house right now because I don't know how to  
**[0:19:35-0:19:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:19:35):**  and I don't have the time and I'm worried that it's not going to work for all of these  
**[0:19:40-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:19:40):**  different reasons but I do want something like that in my life so I'm going to just  
**[0:19:45-0:19:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:19:45):**  go out in the woods and find some sandy clay and play with it and make this little thing  
**[0:19:51-0:19:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:19:51):**  and like make a decoration on my wall and maybe it cracks and all falls off and I've  
**[0:19:58-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:19:58):**  got to go do a little research on the internet to find out what I'm going to do to make it  
**[0:20:02-0:20:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:20:02):**  stick to my wall and then someday I actually have it stuck to my wall and I look at that  
**[0:20:08-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:20:08):**  and I say well what can I do with the rest of the room and then I say well what can I  
**[0:20:12-0:20:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:20:12):**  do with the rest of the house and you make it a gradual transition and you spend your  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:20:19):**  vacation going and volunteering at somebody else's house to learn how to do this instead  
**[0:20:24-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:20:24):**  of sitting on a beach in the Bahamas or maybe you decide that you like things just fine  
**[0:20:33-0:20:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:20:33):**  like they are but you're going to use that process of thinking them through and imagining  
**[0:20:42-0:20:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:20:42):**  what they might be to change what you do for a living or whatever but the other way you  
**[0:20:49-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:20:49):**  can do this is to pick something crazy and do it, something that you'll use to say to  
**[0:21:00-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:21:00):**  yourself yeah I can do anything I want so like a composting toilet.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:21:07):**  You don't need a $3,000, $2,000 professionally made composting toilet when you can go to  
**[0:21:17-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:21:17):**  Joe Jenkins website for his Humanure Handbook and he actually has the entire book on the

**[0:21:41-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:21:41):**  Well that flush toilet takes almost half of the water that goes through your house and  
**[0:21:52-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:21:52):**  if you're not just a little bit disturbed by the amount of water we use to dispose of  
**[0:22:00-0:22:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:22:00):**  a little tiny bit of waste and ruin that water and make that waste go into our streams and  
**[0:22:08-0:22:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:22:08):**  pollute them, the algae blooms and all that, then I don't think you're thinking very clearly  
**[0:22:14-0:22:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:22:14):**  about how these systems all connect but if you just say yeah I'm going to put a bucket  
**[0:22:20-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:22:20):**  in my bathroom and I'm going to poop in it and people are going to look at me funny but  
**[0:22:28-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:22:28):**  I'm going to take that bucket of sawdust and poop and put it in a composting pile for a  
**[0:22:36-0:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:22:36):**  year and let it just sit there and get hot and cook and kill all the pathogens and then  
**[0:22:41-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:22:41):**  my tomatoes are going to love that soil.

**[0:22:52-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:22:52):**  that nutrient that's being put back into the soil and I'm going to smirk and I'm going  
**[0:22:58-0:23:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:22:58):**  to go look and think of something else that I can do that might be considered radical  
**[0:23:05-0:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:23:05):**  or strange but is going to make me feel like I've done something worthwhile.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:23:14):**  It's worth mentioning too that it doesn't have to be as rustic as just a bucket in a  
**[0:23:19-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:23:19):**  box or something.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:23:20):**  With very little money you can make them quite pleasant with no risk of odors and very user  
**[0:23:26-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:23:26):**  friendly.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:23:27):**  I've seen some great ones that I've built for clients that I've seen at friends houses  
**[0:23:32-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:23:32):**  and things like that too.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:23:34):**  Even if your budget is really limited it doesn't have to be so rustic that it's unpleasant  
**[0:23:41-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:23:41):**  or strange for people to use even if they're not accustomed to it.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:23:44):**  I'm a big fan of those composting toilets.

**[0:23:50-0:23:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:23:50):**  And so you start looking around and saying well what else is going to make a difference  
**[0:23:56-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:23:56):**  in my life?  
**[0:24:00-0:24:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:24:00):**  Maybe I start carving spoons and when you can go to a thrift store and get a spoon for  
**[0:24:06-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:24:06):**  50 cents or you can get a whole set of cutlery for 10 bucks it doesn't quote unquote pay  
**[0:24:13-0:24:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:24:13):**  for your time to learn how let alone just to do it but there's a satisfaction in being  
**[0:24:22-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:24:22):**  able to do something and there's a pleasure in this contemplative thing whether it's knitting  
**[0:24:32-0:24:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:24:32):**  or quilting or making candles out of wax or whatever but just finding something that you

**[0:29:14-0:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:29:14):**  that you don't renegotiate or you just move on with your life at the end of five years,

**[0:29:32-0:29:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:29:32):**  You walk away with thirty thousand dollars in your pocket.

**[0:29:40-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:29:40):**  or there's unlimited options of what you could have done with that, yeah.

**[0:31:03-0:31:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:31:03):**  it is, the difference between your rent from that three months and the money it would have  
**[0:31:08-0:31:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:31:08):**  cost that you spent, but you're out forty two hundred dollars.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:31:14):**  Now you can recover from forty two hundred dollars, you can't recover from fifty thousand  
**[0:31:20-0:31:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:31:20):**  dollars for a tiny house that didn't, on wheels, that somebody else built you that you have

**[0:31:47-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:31:47):**  can walk away from, that you can limp away from.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:31:51):**  Any landing you can walk away from is a good landing.

**[0:32:01-0:32:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:32:01):**  from, what things can I do that I've always wanted to do and that are going to work because  
**[0:32:10-0:32:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:32:10):**  I can walk away from it.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:32:13):**  So that's the too small to fail and when we buy a house, the thirty year mortgage, mortgage  
**[0:32:20-0:32:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:32:20):**  is an old French word for death pledge, basically you are taking on all of the risk of this

**[0:32:57-0:33:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:32:57):**  We make tremendous risks for these houses that we live in but we consider it too risky  
**[0:33:06-0:33:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:33:06):**  to spend a couple grand on a tree house.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:33:11):**  I find that a bit upside down because she's already gotten her value a year in, she's  
**[0:33:19-0:33:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:33:19):**  already gotten her value out of this tree house emotionally and spiritually and financially  
**[0:33:29-0:33:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:33:29):**  and now it's just the icing on the cake.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:33:32):**  So if she had bought a house or rented, that value would be harder to recoup.

**[0:36:00-0:36:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:36:00):**  tip.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:36:02):**  In this session I'm going to be talking more about looking for alternatives.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:36:06):**  Now I know that Chris already touched quite a bit on this in his interview and I wanted  
**[0:36:09-0:36:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:36:09):**  to elaborate on a few of the concepts that we discussed.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:36:13):**  Now looking for alternatives covers a lot of ground.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:36:16):**  This could be lighting or heating solutions, waste water management, alternative building  
**[0:36:21-0:36:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:36:21):**  materials, or even just switching up your daily routines and habits.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:36:25):**  The reason why this is a tricky tip to implement is that it requires you to analyze your life  
**[0:36:30-0:36:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:36:30):**  and try to look at it from a non-obvious perspective.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:36:33):**  So one of the best ways that I've found to do this is to ask yourself why three times.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:36:39):**  This will help you get to reasons and motivations behind your habits and routines, or even help  
**[0:36:44-0:36:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:36:44):**  you to question your own infrastructure.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:36:47):**  I'll give you an example of this.  
**[0:36:50-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:36:50):**  Why do you pay hundreds of dollars to heat or air condition your house?  
**[0:36:54-0:36:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:36:54):**  Well, because electricity is expensive and your heater or air conditioner uses a lot  
**[0:36:59-0:37:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:36:59):**  of energy.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:37:00):**  Here I'm using the possibility that you're heating or cooling with electricity, but this  
**[0:37:03-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:37:03):**  could apply to just about any heat source.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:37:07):**  Now why is electricity expensive?  
**[0:37:10-0:37:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:37:10):**  And why do your appliances use so much?  
**[0:37:12-0:37:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:37:12):**  Well, electricity is expensive because it takes a lot of infrastructure to mine or extract  
**[0:37:17-0:37:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:37:17):**  the resources and then get it to your house from centralized locations.  
**[0:37:21-0:37:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:37:21):**  And your appliances use so much because they use it inefficiently in most cases, or maybe  
**[0:37:27-0:37:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:37:27):**  the space that you're trying to heat is not insulated.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:37:31):**  Well so why are you using outdated centralized power sources that burn fossil fuels and appliances  
**[0:37:37-0:37:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:37:37):**  that use the energy inefficiently?  
**[0:37:40-0:37:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:37:40):**  So maybe you haven't considered alternative sources, the possibility of installing solar  
**[0:37:44-0:37:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:37:44):**  or wind power, or learned how to build yourself a stove that heats your home at a fraction  
**[0:37:49-0:37:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:37:49):**  of the cost.  
**[0:37:51-0:37:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:37:51):**  Insulating the space could be another solution as well.  
**[0:37:54-0:37:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:37:54):**  Now of course these are only a few possible outcomes from asking why.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:37:59):**  The answers that apply to your specific situation might be completely different, but this was  
**[0:38:03-0:38:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:38:03):**  just an example.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:38:05):**  Assessing why a few times will cause you to question your situation and choices more deeply  
**[0:38:09-0:38:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:38:09):**  than normal and lead you to possibilities you might never have considered.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:38:15):**  So once you're open to alternative ways of taking care of your needs, you may find that  
**[0:38:19-0:38:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:38:19):**  you no longer have to do the things that you don't like in order to support systems and  
**[0:38:24-0:38:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:38:24):**  habits that don't make you happy.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:38:27):**  If you have recently considered a new alternative for your lifestyle, or if you find solutions  
**[0:38:32-0:38:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-d9dicdudf7362d9jopygi4uts8i13l/#t=0:38:32):**  using this easy way of questioning yourself, I would love to hear about it in the comment

**[0:01:28-0:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:01:28):**  Isabel Fautier is the founder of EgoEcho.ca whose mission is to inspire people to move

**[0:02:04-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:02:04):**  we can be effective changemakers out in the world through a combination of both personal  
**[0:02:09-0:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:02:09):**  and group work in ecologically minded communities.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:02:12):**  Now since my good friend and colleague, Neil Hegerty, had just finished taking Isabel's  
**[0:02:16-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:02:16):**  three-day course on social permaculture, I gave the mic over to him to conduct the interview.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:02:22):**  So here's Neil and Isabel in our first on a series of alternative applications for permaculture.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:02:27):**  I hope you're as inspired by these concepts as I am.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:02:30):**  Okay, so I'm joined today by Isabel Fortier from Canada, I just finished taking part in  
**[0:02:39-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:02:39):**  Isabel's social permaculture course, so I'm really excited to be interviewing Isabel today.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:02:45):**  Hello everybody.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:02:47):**  So Isabel, I think we'll get straight into this, why don't you tell me a little bit about  
**[0:02:52-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:02:52):**  your background and what it was that led you to social permaculture.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:02:56):**  Okay, first of all, when I was in my 20s, I wanted to change the world when I realized  
**[0:03:03-0:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:03:03):**  that it was going so wrong.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:03:05):**  So I decided to study international cooperation.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:03:09):**  So I've been working in Africa and seeing that it's really political and that it doesn't  
**[0:03:17-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:03:17):**  have such good effect.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:03:19):**  When the project fails, when the co-operants go away, and then coming back from this experience,  
**[0:03:29-0:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:03:29):**  I say, okay, if I still want to do something to get a better world, I should work on people.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:03:35):**  So why not studying psychotherapy?  
**[0:03:37-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:03:37):**  So I went on studying body psychotherapy, because for me it was really this idea that  
**[0:03:44-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:03:44):**  if we want to change the world, anyway we need to start by ourselves.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:03:48):**  Because even if we do the most beautiful project, but we're not in peace inside us, we're going  
**[0:03:55-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:03:55):**  to get in conflicts, we're going to be in very overpower on people and it won't go well.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:04:03):**  So that's what I did.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:04:05):**  And so from there, there I was working in a college in Quebec.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:04:11):**  I'm from the French part of Canada, if you can hear.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:04:16):**  And that's it, so I work in college, so I was a spiritual and community life facilitator.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:04:23):**  So I was there specifically to help the youth to find themselves and find where they can  
**[0:04:31-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:04:31):**  go to help the world go better too.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:04:33):**  You know, it was really working on the two level.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:04:37):**  So I did that for 10 years until I realized that it was not any more fulfilling for me.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:04:44):**  I needed a new challenge and I really wanted since a long time to work in nature too.  
**[0:04:50-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:04:50):**  I knew that nature could teach so much, so I decided to do a PDC, permaculture design certificate.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:05:00):**  And when I did that, I've learned about social permaculture and I say, oh yeah, I'm just  
**[0:05:05-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:05:05):**  doing social permaculture since my whole career.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:05:09):**  But I didn't know that it was under that hat, it's a big hat, covering a lot of stuff.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:05:14):**  I was teaching conflict resolution, deep listening, I was teaching how to get people that they  
**[0:05:23-0:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:05:23):**  can get closer to their niche.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:05:25):**  It's all subject that it's covering in social permaculture.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:05:30):**  And so I just continued my way and then I encountered Joanna Macy.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:05:36):**  She's an underhand metallicist.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:05:39):**  She's now 88 years old.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:05:41):**  She's been an activist for all her life and a lot working against nuclear.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:05:48):**  And she created an approach called work that reconnects.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:05:51):**  It's under two social permaculture.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:05:54):**  And when I met her, it was kind of a, wow, it's okay.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:05:58):**  It was for me a path that I could take to continue my work.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:06:03):**  It was an approach that I knew quite everything what she's putting out, but the way that she  
**[0:06:09-0:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:06:09):**  structure our approach, you know, it's very effective.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:06:14):**  It's mainly now the base with what I'm working with permaculture.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:06:20):**  The really interesting story.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:06:23):**  It sounds like almost like the typical path.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:06:26):**  I think for a lot of people, you start out wanting to change the world and it leads you  
**[0:06:31-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:06:31):**  to wanting to change yourself.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:06:35):**  So could you talk a little bit about some of the approaches you use in your workshop?  
**[0:06:42-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:06:42):**  I know you rely very much on Joanna Macy's framework, but I guess it's, yeah.

**[0:06:54-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:06:54):**  Yeah, that's it.  
**[0:06:55-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:06:55):**  So first of all, the approach of Joanna Macy is called work that reconnects.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:07:01):**  And what she put forward is we need to go from an industrial society to a society who  
**[0:07:09-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:07:09):**  will support the life.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:07:12):**  And she said that we are right now, you know, with this ecological crisis on, she called  
**[0:07:18-0:07:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:07:18):**  it the great turning.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:07:20):**  So we really need as society to make a big turn because we're going to soon hit the wall.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:07:28):**  So we won't have the, you know, we need to make this great turning.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:07:33):**  And she said that to do it, we need to work on tree level.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:07:36):**  So first of all, change structure as permaculture is, you know, another way to work with nature.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:07:42):**  It's very effective and important to do so.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:07:46):**  We need to do some activists, protest for all those projects who kind of are against  
**[0:07:54-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:07:54):**  life.  
**[0:07:55-0:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:07:55):**  And the third way is to work on yourself.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:07:59):**  And for her, it's really that we really need to work on the tree level at the same time.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:08:03):**  So this is the base.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:08:05):**  And after she works with a spiral, so we start by gratitude.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:08:13):**  Because if you want really to support life, to, you know, care for hurt, as we say in  
**[0:08:19-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:08:19):**  permaculture, we need to love it.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:08:22):**  And to love it, you need to recognize everything that hurts bring to you.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:08:27):**  Because often people have been growth in cities and they don't even, you know, realize where  
**[0:08:34-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:08:34):**  their food come from, you know, it's just they give cash and they get their vegetables,  
**[0:08:40-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:08:40):**  but they don't even know how broccoli grows.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:08:43):**  For me, I find it very funny because not so long ago, I didn't know neither, you know,  
**[0:08:48-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:08:48):**  I'm from a city.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:08:50):**  So when I realized, okay, I really need to get closer to nature.  
**[0:08:54-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:08:54):**  So it was a part of my interest to go back to nature.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:09:00):**  And so from gratitude, you know, it's, but it really is gratitude too for what you have  
**[0:09:06-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:09:06):**  in your life, you know, how you can see the glass half full instead of half empty because  
**[0:09:12-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:09:12):**  we're in so much in consumerism, then we always see half empty and we want more and we think  
**[0:09:19-0:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:09:19):**  that if we get more, we'll be more happy.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:09:21):**  So having gratitude, it's revolutionary, you know, because if everybody will feel satisfied,  
**[0:09:31-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:09:31):**  we consume less and the world will get better.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:09:36):**  So I think this is very important.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:09:38):**  And the second aspect of this spiral, it's honoring the pain we have for our world.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:09:47):**  So this is so important because we know that there's so much suffering in the planet Earth,  
**[0:09:56-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:09:56):**  you know, from terrorism, you know, hunger, wars, you know, climate change, everything.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:10:04):**  But it's so big that often we just don't want to see it.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:10:08):**  But without honoring this pain, we don't face it and we don't act on it neither.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:10:15):**  So recognizing the pain from the world, being able to touch this pain into yourself would  
**[0:10:22-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:10:22):**  make something inside you and you will feel more.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:10:28):**  It's called work that reconnects.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:10:29):**  It's really that you will feel more connected for those people maybe far from your house,  
**[0:10:35-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:10:35):**  from your country, but they're suffering and we are all one, we're interconnected, you  
**[0:10:40-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:10:40):**  know.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:10:41):**  So how can my behavior after could be really more conscious and conscious of my impact,  
**[0:10:49-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:10:49):**  what I'm going to buy, how I'm going to act, you know, what project I can, you know, engage  
**[0:10:56-0:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:10:56):**  on to get it better.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:10:58):**  But to do that, you know, to have this kind of motivation to move forward, you need to  
**[0:11:02-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:11:02):**  recognize the pain.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:11:04):**  If not, you're okay, I'm good, I'm alone in my little house with my family, everything  
**[0:11:08-0:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:11:08):**  goes well, you know.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:11:11):**  But it's really opening your eyes of this interconnection of the world.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:11:18):**  And the third aspect of the spiral, it's seeing with new eyes.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:11:25):**  So this is because I like to talk about it a lot because human beings now seeing themselves  
**[0:11:35-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:11:35):**  as in the top of the pyramid, you know.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:11:37):**  There's the man and there's the woman and the whales and there's the mammals and there's  
**[0:11:42-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:11:42):**  the fishes and after the plants, you know, we see it kind of in a pyramid.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:11:50):**  But how we can see it really, you know, as an ecosystem, as we all part of the same thing  
**[0:11:54-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:11:54):**  and we all need each other to have an effective world.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:12:00):**  So seeing with new eyes, it's being able to see in other people's eyes, to see in animals,  
**[0:12:09-0:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:12:09):**  plants' eyes, you know.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:12:10):**  When you want to start a project for gas or everything, what will be the effect, you know,  
**[0:12:16-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:12:16):**  on the whales, on the water, on the land.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:12:20):**  So how you can change your point of view to be able to be empathetic to others.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:12:25):**  But this also to be able to see yourself as human being in the deep time perspective.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:12:31):**  So how you can see yourself as a, you can see yourself, you know, as maybe 80 years  
**[0:12:39-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:12:39):**  until 60,000 years of humanity, you know.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:12:44):**  So we are part of this big ancestor line lineage.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:12:48):**  So seeing yourself just humbling, you know.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:12:52):**  So okay, I'm just there for 80 years, but what will be my impact?  
**[0:12:57-0:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:12:57):**  I'm going to work with it because each thing you do has an impact on the world.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:13:01):**  So it's about to see with new eyes, be able to connect with your ancestor, connect to  
**[0:13:06-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:13:06):**  the future generation.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:13:08):**  Remember yourself that, yeah, you're impactful on seven generations ahead, you know.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:13:14):**  And the fourth aspect of the spiral is going forth.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:13:19):**  And going forth is, okay, after that, you know, being able to have gratitude to honoring  
**[0:13:25-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:13:25):**  the pain, to see with new eyes.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:13:28):**  So who I am, you know, being passing from the ego to the eco, realizing that I'm interconnected,  
**[0:13:37-0:13:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:13:37):**  realizing that I have my role to play, I have an impact on the world.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:13:40):**  So how I will act in the world, what's my purpose?

**[0:13:50-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:13:50):**  themselves and really, you know, have a good and great impact on the world at the same  
**[0:13:55-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:13:55):**  time.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:13:56):**  So I think when we're really aligning with ourself, it's very interesting because often  
**[0:14:01-0:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:14:01):**  what you do, it's good for the world too.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:14:04):**  So you give, you feel a lot of accomplishment, but at the same time you give for the world.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:14:10):**  So it's giving and receiving at the same time.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:14:12):**  So those are the four aspects of the spiral of Joannès Macy's work.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:14:17):**  So it's the base with what I'm starting my workshop when I give them.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:14:24):**  Yeah, and it's a really interesting base to work from.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:14:28):**  I've just taken the workshop and it's, it is, it's a real journey.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:14:33):**  There's lots of meditations, silent work, group work.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:14:40):**  It only was three days, but it feels like a bit of a journey.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:14:46):**  You know, the one thing that struck me doing it is the kind of importance of being able  
**[0:14:53-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:14:53):**  to just create and hold that container, you know, because the content is one thing and  
**[0:14:59-0:15:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:14:59):**  understanding it, but the work actually brings up a lot more emotions than you could maybe  
**[0:15:05-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:15:05):**  predict.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:15:08):**  So I wonder if you could talk a little bit about how your training as a psychotherapist  
**[0:15:13-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:15:13):**  has like helped you to deal with the types of things that come up in these workshops.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:15:17):**  Yes, yeah, I'm a body psychotherapist.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:15:21):**  I have to say it because the term psychotherapist, it's now in Quebec at least specific for those  
**[0:15:29-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:15:29):**  person who have a specific training.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:15:32):**  So body psychotherapist, I can say it.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:15:34):**  Yeah, so I'm trained as a body psychotherapist and of course in this approach it's all about  
**[0:15:43-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:15:43):**  listening to your body as a guide, you know, to be able to see where you're at and how  
**[0:15:50-0:15:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:15:50):**  do you feel.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:15:51):**  So this is of course the base of my work too.  
**[0:15:54-0:16:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:15:54):**  So helping people first of all to sit within themselves, see what is there, what are the  
**[0:16:00-0:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:16:00):**  emotions, what are the physical feelings and what are they on their mind.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:16:06):**  So we start there, just say okay where I am and each day, one or two times a day we stop  
**[0:16:13-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:16:13):**  for five minutes and do that check in to see okay what's there.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:16:19):**  So that's the basic because if you want to encounter somebody else you need to encounter  
**[0:16:23-0:16:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:16:23):**  yourself first.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:16:24):**  If not you'll just be on projecting on others what you're not able to see within yourself.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:16:31):**  So from that scan or where you are, so what are your needs?  
**[0:16:36-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:16:36):**  So being able to see you know what's need is there and how you can try to fulfill them  
**[0:16:42-0:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:16:42):**  and for me create a safe container.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:16:45):**  It's to be able to first of all recognize that each one is there and we recognize the  
**[0:16:52-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:16:52):**  importance of their presence with whatever they feel because you can arrive to my workshop  
**[0:16:57-0:17:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:16:57):**  and feel really bad and you can say it in front of others and you can be welcome with  
**[0:17:03-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:17:03):**  that and this will change too but just being able to feel it, say it to others, maybe say  
**[0:17:09-0:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:17:09):**  your need I will need to take a longer break and will try really to listen to the people  
**[0:17:15-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:17:15):**  need so that they can really feel comfortable that their needs can be understand and fulfilled.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:17:22):**  So just this in life I think it's really revolutionary because we never take time to really ask where  
**[0:17:28-0:17:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:17:28):**  the people are and how we can help them to fulfill their need to be present and I'm working  
**[0:17:33-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:17:33):**  with that too and it's very impressive how it works because people I really feel that  
**[0:17:39-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:17:39):**  starting by it it's just kind of ah I have the right to feel anything and I have place  
**[0:17:44-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:17:44):**  to say if I need something so it really brings confidence and trust between each other and  
**[0:17:54-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:17:54):**  being clear of what is your intention why you're there what you're looking for so this  
**[0:17:59-0:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:17:59):**  as more as you're clear with your intention as more as you will get from it you know because  
**[0:18:06-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:18:06):**  you know what you're looking for so you will figure out how to find it and it can be one  
**[0:18:11-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:18:11):**  of your need to if one of your intention is not fulfilled so it's very interesting because  
**[0:18:16-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:18:16):**  it's a co-creation I'm the facilitator but we we are all responsible of fulfilling our  
**[0:18:24-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:18:24):**  needs our interests our you know clear intention intention so this is a part of it and after  
**[0:18:35-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:18:35):**  being able to be in contact with yourself then we we go through meeting the others so  
**[0:18:42-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:18:42):**  I use storytelling too in my approach so from the storytelling you know from native storytelling  
**[0:18:48-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:18:48):**  very initiative tale so you can see yourself into the story so then I'm gonna give space  
**[0:18:56-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:18:56):**  so that people can share to each other what they feel where they are in that story so  
**[0:19:02-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:19:02):**  they are able to project themselves in the story so we kind of now as a group we have  
**[0:19:08-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:19:08):**  a story what it's a commune story now we have a same you know same repair we see in French  
**[0:19:17-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:19:17):**  so oh yeah maybe I feel like like like the little mouse now in the story so everyone  
**[0:19:24-0:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:19:24):**  know what the other person talks about you know because we have something in common so  
**[0:19:29-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:19:29):**  now in many countries the religions goes away before it was you know this religious story  
**[0:19:36-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:19:36):**  that we had in common that we were we were sharing and being able to kind of a figure  
**[0:19:42-0:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:19:42):**  out where we were through that those story from the religion but now that we don't have  
**[0:19:47-0:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:19:47):**  any more those story that we share together so what will be the story that we will share  
**[0:19:52-0:19:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:19:52):**  together so that we can really deeply in another level understand each other so from there  
**[0:19:58-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:19:58):**  we go and we really try to work on communication and deep listening so I give some tips on  
**[0:20:05-0:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:20:05):**  non-violent communication deep listening so from being really in contact with yourself  
**[0:20:10-0:20:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:20:10):**  grounded in yourself listening the other and see let yourself being touched not trying  
**[0:20:16-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:20:16):**  to push out what you want to say but just being able to listen and and be a mirror for  
**[0:20:23-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:20:23):**  the other or from each other so that that's our two tools that I'm using too and then  
**[0:20:32-0:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:20:32):**  I will use a lot of yeah meditation to different kind of meditation theater games to help to  
**[0:20:40-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:20:40):**  get in touch with yourself with others too yeah yeah it's really interesting one of the  
**[0:20:48-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:20:48):**  things that struck me most about the course was the was the second section on honoring  
**[0:20:54-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:20:54):**  the pain you know because a lot of stuff came up just with general levels of pain people  
**[0:21:03-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:21:03):**  were feeling and once you start to actually pull the thread on that and you see how much  
**[0:21:08-0:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:21:08):**  pain and trauma there is in the world it's actually quite overwhelming and we you know  
**[0:21:14-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:21:14):**  we have these were come through these ideas know about kind of like transgenerational  
**[0:21:19-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:21:19):**  trauma the trauma to the land and once we start to understand how interconnected it  
**[0:21:24-0:21:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:21:24):**  all is we really see that we are a generation of of quite traumatized people and it seems

**[0:34:03-0:34:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:34:03):**  strikes me that it really is something that could and maybe should be incorporated more  
**[0:34:08-0:34:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:34:08):**  into pdc's uh as opposed to just uh touched on have you have you taught on a full pdc  
**[0:34:15-0:34:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:34:15):**  or do you have any plans to but now we're talking shad and i from at italian organic  
**[0:34:23-0:34:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:34:23):**  we're talking about maybe integrating more social permaculture aspect into a pdc and  
**[0:34:29-0:34:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:34:29):**  we're just talking about that because i really think it should be integrated because even  
**[0:34:35-0:34:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:34:35):**  if you have a beautiful land and uh you know with really permaculture design but you cannot  
**[0:34:42-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:34:42):**  live with people with who you work with who you had bought that land you know it doesn't  
**[0:34:49-0:34:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:34:49):**  make sense so i think yeah and i have a company it's called ego eco so ego slash eco so how  
**[0:34:58-0:35:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:34:58):**  we can you know go beyond our ego to to be more in this conscious that we are and you  
**[0:35:07-0:35:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:35:07):**  know interdependent and we coexist you know with nature with others so how to pass from  
**[0:35:14-0:35:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:35:14):**  one to the other and uh within ego it's interesting because for me it was too you know often you  
**[0:35:21-0:35:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:35:21):**  have uh you know we were studying psychology in one way and then ecology in the other way  
**[0:35:28-0:35:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:35:28):**  so you know social permaculture and work that reconnects come from an approach called eco  
**[0:35:33-0:35:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:35:33):**  psychology so it's really you know melt you know melding the the two approaches because  
**[0:35:41-0:35:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:35:41):**  how can we not be we separate so much stuff you know even you know in medicine you know  
**[0:35:49-0:35:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:35:49):**  each bicilius for each part of your body but your body's working as a wall so how can you  
**[0:35:56-0:36:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:35:56):**  not work you know we should work in the in the more integrative way so in eco psychology  
**[0:36:03-0:36:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:36:03):**  it's this you know and for me social permaculture and permaculture design certificate it's should  
**[0:36:09-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:36:09):**  be the same because we're part of nature we are nature you know if if there's a climate  
**[0:36:16-0:36:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:36:16):**  climate change will be psychically affect of it the way you look at nature it's the  
**[0:36:22-0:36:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:36:22):**  way you look at yourself too you know the where you position ego eco comes from you  
**[0:36:27-0:36:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:36:27):**  know this idea that anthropocentrism you know as human we put we look at ourselves as in  
**[0:36:34-0:36:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:36:34):**  the top of the nature so if you look at yourself as it you know you're gonna abuse of it because  
**[0:36:41-0:36:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:36:41):**  the nature will the nature will just be there to kind of just furnish to you what you need  
**[0:36:48-0:36:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:36:48):**  but if you realize that you're part of it but of course you want if it's a part of yourself  
**[0:36:55-0:37:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:36:55):**  you won't harm yourself you'll care of yourself so i think we really need to integrate stuff  
**[0:37:01-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:37:01):**  together as eco psychology as permaculture it should be the same thing yeah i mean that's  
**[0:37:07-0:37:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:37:07):**  great news i teach with athlete land organics and shad as well and so for me it would be

**[0:37:27-0:37:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:37:27):**  that they are part of nature as opposed to separate from it but it's an experiential  
**[0:37:32-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-applying-permaculture-to-your-life-and-social-interactions-with-isabelle-fortierof-egoeco-055/#t=0:37:32):**  type of learning that really has to be has to be felt and i think that's the big benefit

**[0:02:23-0:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:02:23):**  We're looking forward to seeing you here.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:02:26):**  Now it's not often that I get the chance to speak with a renowned animal behaviorist,  
**[0:02:30-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:02:30):**  much less for a talk about nutrition and nourishment, but my guest today, Fred Prevenza, Professor  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:02:36):**  Emeritus at Utah State University, makes the argument that we can learn a lot about our  
**[0:02:41-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:02:41):**  own health by observing the way that animals choose their food in their natural environments.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:02:46):**  Fred challenges us to be more skeptical of the latest diets and academic findings on  
**[0:02:50-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:02:50):**  nutrition and listen more to our own bodies and how they respond to the food we ingest.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:02:56):**  In this interview, Fred explains how his observations of seemingly counterintuitive eating behavior  
**[0:03:01-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:03:01):**  in goats first compelled him to look deeper into the nutritional wisdom of animals and  
**[0:03:06-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:03:06):**  how his findings gave him valuable insights into how we can begin to rediscover our own  
**[0:03:11-0:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:03:11):**  nutritional wisdom on a personal basis.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:03:14):**  We also talk about how someone, like myself, who is coming from a place of chronic digestive  
**[0:03:19-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:03:19):**  issues can rebuild their system to the point that we can trust the signals that our body  
**[0:03:23-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:03:23):**  is giving us once again.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:03:25):**  Now before I give too much away, I'll turn things over to Fred.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:03:29):**  Hey, Fred, thanks so much for taking the time to be with us here today.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:03:32):**  How you doing?  
**[0:03:33-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:03:33):**  You bet, Oliver.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:03:34):**  I'm happy to be here with you and I'm doing great.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:03:37):**  Perfect.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:03:38):**  Now, I've been really keen to talk to you because your new book, Nourishment, What Animals  
**[0:03:43-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:03:43):**  Can Teach Us About Rediscovering Our Nutritional Wisdom, is a very interesting perspective  
**[0:03:48-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:03:48):**  on the ever-changing and controversial topic of health and nutrition.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:03:53):**  So what do you say we just jump right into the meat of things?  
**[0:03:55-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:03:55):**  Sounds good to me.  
**[0:03:57-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:03:57):**  Perfect.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:03:58):**  Now, Fred, I've got to start by asking, how did you, as an animal behaviorist, come to  
**[0:04:03-0:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:04:03):**  write a book largely about nourishment and dietary choices?  
**[0:04:08-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:04:08):**  Well, from the time that I was a young pup, actually, Oliver, I was really interested  
**[0:04:15-0:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:04:15):**  in wild animals, what they did, where they went.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:04:18):**  I worked on a ranch for many years in Colorado when I was an undergraduate in wildlife biology  
**[0:04:26-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:04:26):**  at Colorado State University.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:04:27):**  All that made me very, very interested in animal behavior.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:04:32):**  And I got especially interested in food selection, nutrition, and health.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:04:36):**  And trying to learn about what abilities do animals have.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:04:40):**  At the time that I was an undergrad and even a graduate student, there was a general belief  
**[0:04:46-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:04:46):**  that livestock didn't have any sort of nutritional wisdom.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:04:52):**  They'd lost that as a result of the process of domestication over the last 10,000 years.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:04:57):**  And so, you know, for 35, 40 years, that's what our group studied, was simply asking  
**[0:05:03-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:05:03):**  a variety of questions in a whole bunch of different ways, asking animals questions that  
**[0:05:09-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:05:09):**  would reveal whether or not they had a nutritional wisdom.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:05:15):**  After I retired from Utah State University in 2009, I thought it would be really interesting  
**[0:05:21-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:05:21):**  to search the literature on human beings and try to compare and contrast what we'd learned  
**[0:05:27-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:05:27):**  on cattle, sheep, goats, bison, you know, a variety of wild animals too, and see what  
**[0:05:34-0:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:05:34):**  was out there in the literature related to human beings.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:05:37):**  And so that's really how nourishment came about, was using what we'd learned about domestic  
**[0:05:42-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:05:42):**  animals as a basis then to talk about what we'd learned, but also then to say, well,  
**[0:05:49-0:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:05:49):**  what do we know about human beings?  
**[0:05:52-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:05:52):**  And you know, it's, as you've alluded to, it's the literature on human beings is vast.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:06:02):**  There's no agreement really that I can find.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:06:05):**  You can find advocates for any kind of diet basically that you would want to find.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:06:12):**  The scientific literature, you know, daily new reports come out that counter what was  
**[0:06:17-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:06:17):**  said in the past.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:06:19):**  So it's really quite confusing but quite interesting to try to delve into that and see, try to make  
**[0:06:28-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:06:28):**  a little bit of sense out of it.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:06:30):**  And that's what I tried to do in nourishment basically.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:06:33):**  So give me some examples of the questions that you asked and the different ways that  
**[0:06:37-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:06:37):**  you observed the animals that you worked with in order to find out how they were selecting  
**[0:06:42-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:06:42):**  their own nutritional choices and medicine.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:06:46):**  I guess for me, where it really started to come into a focus was the years that I worked  
**[0:06:55-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:06:55):**  on my graduate degrees, working with goats in Southern Utah down near the town of St.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:07:03):**  George, up in the boonies there.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:07:05):**  And we were using the goats as a way to prune this shrub black brush.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:07:10):**  If you prune it in the winter, it stimulates new growth on the plant.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:07:15):**  And that new growth from lab analyses that people had done, we knew was higher in energy  
**[0:07:21-0:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:07:21):**  and protein and minerals compared to the old woody growth.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:07:25):**  Now we were trying to use the goats as these mobile pruning machines to make the habitat  
**[0:07:29-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:07:29):**  better for wildlife species and domestic cattle that foraged on those areas.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:07:35):**  But I saw two things that really, really caught my attention during those years.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:07:41):**  One, the goats didn't want to eat the new growth.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:07:44):**  So that was really, you know, what's going on?  
**[0:07:48-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:07:48):**  What's going on here?  
**[0:07:49-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:07:49):**  We know it's more nutritious from the standpoint of lab analyses, but they don't want to touch  
**[0:07:55-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:07:55):**  it.  
**[0:07:56-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:07:56):**  So that was one issue.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:07:57):**  But another issue too, we had six different pastures down there with goats on them.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:08:02):**  And goats in one of the pastures started to eat woodrat houses.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:08:07):**  Now woodrats down there make these nice big houses at the base of juniper trees.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:08:13):**  And then they cover those houses with bark from the juniper trees.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:08:16):**  So you know, it's like, wow, black brush is not great feed.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:08:21):**  But these woodrat houses look even worse.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:08:25):**  But what I realized was that the goats in one of those pastures had found basically  
**[0:08:31-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:08:31):**  the woodrat houses have different rooms in them.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:08:35):**  And one of the rooms is the bathroom basically.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:08:37):**  And that's the room that interested the goats most.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:08:40):**  Well, so why?  
**[0:08:44-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:08:44):**  That bathroom is soaked in urine.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:08:45):**  And that urine-soaked vegetation is really a super way to get a protein supplement.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:08:53):**  And so the goats had learned that eating those woodrat houses was providing them with a nutrient  
**[0:08:59-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:08:59):**  that they were lacking that actually was then helping them to better utilize the black brush.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:09:05):**  And so, you know, after three months of being on black brush, the goats in that pasture  
**[0:09:09-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:09:09):**  that figured that out weighed, had better weight than the goats in the other five pastures.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:09:19):**  So that made me realize, you know, hey, these animals are really, they're figuring things  
**[0:09:23-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:09:23):**  out when they're in a deficient state through the sampling.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:09:28):**  They were able to figure that out.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:09:30):**  But what was interesting too is only that one group of goats figured it out.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:09:36):**  Five other groups of goats that had plenty of woodrat houses in their pastures never  
**[0:09:41-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:09:41):**  figured that out.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:09:43):**  So that really got me thinking about nutritional wisdom and how it works.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:09:48):**  And I believe that the goats absolutely had that.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:09:52):**  It was interesting though during that time, my colleagues at Utah State University who,  
**[0:09:58-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:09:58):**  you know, this was the general feeling.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:10:01):**  Animals don't have nutritional wisdom, especially the domestics.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:10:05):**  And I remember a toxicologist when I told him then, going back to the earlier point,  
**[0:10:10-0:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:10:10):**  that the goats wouldn't eat the new growth on the black brush.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:10:17):**  When I told him that, he looked at me and he said, well, I guess that just goes to show  
**[0:10:21-0:10:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:10:21):**  animals don't have nutritional wisdom, doesn't it?  
**[0:10:24-0:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:10:24):**  I didn't believe it at the time, but I didn't know how you would go about proving that animals  
**[0:10:30-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:10:30):**  have nutritional wisdom.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:10:33):**  So why are the goats avoiding the new growth that's higher in energy, protein, minerals,  
**[0:10:38-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:10:38):**  and so forth?  
**[0:10:39-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:10:39):**  What we came to find out through a series of bioassays where we would basically extract  
**[0:10:45-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:10:45):**  and purify compounds that were in the new growth, we came to realize that the new growth  
**[0:10:51-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:10:51):**  was exceedingly high in a particular kind of compound called a condensed tannin.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:10:57):**  And that tannin would have been harmful to the goats.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:11:00):**  And so they were avoiding it.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:11:03):**  They knew.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:11:04):**  They knew this was not good for them.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:11:06):**  So that's long-winded, however, but those things really piqued my interest.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:11:12):**  One, here's these animals figuring out that woodrat houses help them with their nitrogen  
**[0:11:18-0:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:11:18):**  status.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:11:19):**  And two, they're realizing that when things have too high concentrations of these so-called  
**[0:11:25-0:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:11:25):**  secondary compounds like this tannin, it's bad for them and they learn to avoid it.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:11:31):**  So that's what started me on 35 years then of asking question after question after question  
**[0:11:37-0:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:11:37):**  related to how does all this work?  
**[0:11:39-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:11:39):**  How does this nutritional work, wisdom of the body work?  
**[0:11:43-0:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:11:43):**  I love that you brought up that example from the book because that was one of the ones  
**[0:11:46-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:11:46):**  that really resonated with me.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:11:48):**  We have a herd of goats here on our small demonstration farm in Guatemala, and we've  
**[0:11:53-0:11:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:11:53):**  been observing for all these months now how they go about while they're out grazing, what  
**[0:11:59-0:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:11:59):**  they like to eat and what they leave behind and how it changes kind of during the cycles  
**[0:12:04-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:12:04):**  that they have.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:12:05):**  For example, a lot of our goats right now just gave birth and they're eating very differently  
**[0:12:09-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:12:09):**  than they were before then.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:12:11):**  And I've had, you know, a number of different explanations from people who've raised goats  
**[0:12:15-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:12:15):**  and know a lot more than I do talking about how their nutritional needs are different.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:12:21):**  And I also really liked that example you gave of them going for sort of the bathroom area  
**[0:12:25-0:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:12:25):**  of the woodrats.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:12:27):**  I had my own experience with that as well when I worked building trails in the wilderness  
**[0:12:31-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:12:31):**  areas of Colorado actually.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:12:33):**  And the mountain goats there, we usually would think that, you know, they would stay away  
**[0:12:38-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:12:38):**  from people and they wouldn't like to interact, but they were constantly at our base camp  
**[0:12:42-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:12:42):**  while we were doing work there because they would go and dig into the earth where we had  
**[0:12:46-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:12:46):**  recently urinated.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:12:48):**  And I can only imagine it was for similar reasons as that example that you gave.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:12:53):**  There were some minerals, possibly salts and other things in there that were sort of supplementing  
**[0:12:58-0:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:12:58):**  what they couldn't get in their natural environment.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:13:01):**  Wow, that's so interesting Oliver.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:13:03):**  That's, you know, those are the kind of things that when you're out with animals all the  
**[0:13:09-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:13:09):**  time, I love, you know, I'm from Colorado originally, love the mountains, love mountain  
**[0:13:14-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:13:14):**  goats too, spent so much time.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:13:18):**  When I went to grad school, my wish was that I would be able to study mountain goats.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:13:22):**  It didn't turn out that way.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:13:24):**  You know, it's domestic goats in Southern Utah rather than mountain goats in Colorado,  
**[0:13:29-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:13:29):**  which worked out just fine.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:13:31):**  But yeah, it's those kinds of observations that really, that are so valuable I think  
**[0:13:40-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:13:40):**  in setting the stage.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:13:41):**  And then what we were able to do is simply through carefully controlled experiments really  
**[0:13:46-0:13:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:13:46):**  pick apart three parts of what I think are just absolutely essential for nutritional  
**[0:13:52-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:13:52):**  wisdom.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:13:53):**  Without all three of what I'm going to mention next here, it can't work.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:13:58):**  And I think a lot of times the reasons that we say domestic animals lack nutritional wisdom,  
**[0:14:04-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:14:04):**  and then when we get to humans, when we say, you know, how can you argue with the obesity  
**[0:14:10-0:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:14:10):**  crisis and all things that are happening that we have nutritional wisdom.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:14:14):**  I think it's because we aren't thinking carefully about all three of these facets that are involved  
**[0:14:20-0:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:14:20):**  in enabling nutritional wisdom.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:14:23):**  The first of these we've really been talking about, but I'm going to call it something  
**[0:14:30-0:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:14:30):**  a little bit, I'm going to name it.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:14:32):**  I'm going to call it flavor feedback relationships, which is what we talked about over the years  
**[0:14:39-0:14:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:14:39):**  on our project.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:14:41):**  What that means is that the flavor of the food gets linked with feedback from cells  
**[0:14:48-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:14:48):**  and organ systems, including the microbiome, which everybody's so jazzed about nowadays.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:14:57):**  That feedback gets linked with the flavor, and it changes our liking for the flavor.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:15:04):**  That's what's so critical to realize is that these flavor feedback relationships are a  
**[0:15:09-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:15:09):**  way that cells, organ systems, including the microbiome, change our liking for the flavor  
**[0:15:15-0:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:15:15):**  of the food.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:15:16):**  To me, it's amazing, and it's not a conscious thing.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:15:20):**  It's not something we sit and think about anymore, and you think about which enzymes  
**[0:15:23-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:15:23):**  or acids to release to digest your food.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:15:26):**  It's happening automatically at a subconscious level, but it's guiding our food selection.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:15:34):**  It can only guide it in a decent way, though, if we're exposed to a variety of wholesome  
**[0:15:40-0:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:15:40):**  foods.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:15:43):**  For wild animals, foraging, like the mountain goats you mentioned out there, huge variety  
**[0:15:49-0:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:15:49):**  of foods, or when domestic animals are allowed to do that, especially where there's a great  
**[0:15:54-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:15:54):**  deal of plant biodiversity, that's so critical to enable this.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:15:59):**  When we take animals, though, and for instance, put them in feedlots and put them on a total  
**[0:16:05-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:16:05):**  mixed ration, there's zero chance for them to self-select their diets.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:16:10):**  A lot of the processed foods that we humans are exposed to isn't all that much different  
**[0:16:15-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:16:15):**  from total mixed rations in feedlots.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:16:19):**  The second part, the first is this flavor feedback, so critical, but without a variety  
**[0:16:25-0:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:16:25):**  of wholesome foods to select from, whether you're a goat out there in the mountains of  
**[0:16:31-0:16:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:16:31):**  Colorado or a human that's exposed to really wholesome, decent kinds of foods, this kind  
**[0:16:41-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:16:41):**  of wisdom can't be enabled.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:16:43):**  The third part that I have just found fascinating, and we studied it from the very first of my  
**[0:16:49-0:16:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:16:49):**  career, is this whole social-cultural part of things.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:16:54):**  It's just fundamental to enabling nutritional wisdom.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:16:59):**  If you lose that in domestic or wild animals or in human beings, you've really lost a huge  
**[0:17:05-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:17:05):**  link to the landscape.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:17:09):**  Domestic animals, if you let them go feral, cattle, sheep, and goats, they end up in extended  
**[0:17:13-0:17:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:17:13):**  families.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:17:14):**  Those are functional kind of units that learn about landscapes and learn how to use, what  
**[0:17:20-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:17:20):**  not to eat, where and where not to go, what's a predator, what's not a predator.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:17:24):**  That culture is huge.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:17:26):**  We've basically broken that down in domestic animals and to an extent in human beings,  
**[0:17:33-0:17:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:17:33):**  the extended families we used to live in.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:17:36):**  How does that work?  
**[0:17:38-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:17:38):**  Even in the womb, young animals are starting to be exposed to mother's diet.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:17:43):**  We know that from studies we've done with livestock.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:17:47):**  We know that from really cool studies on human beings too.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:17:52):**  During the last trimester of gestation, the fetal taste system is fully functional.  
**[0:17:56-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:17:56):**  The foods that mom's eating, the flavors of those foods are getting into the amniotic  
**[0:18:01-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:18:01):**  food.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:18:02):**  The young organ, the young creature is already starting to learn about what's food before  
**[0:18:09-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:18:09):**  it's even born.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:18:13):**  Then after birth, flavors and foods get into mother's milk.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:18:18):**  Again, cues as to what's a diet.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:18:21):**  Then when young animals begin to forage, going with mom, looking at what she's eating and  
**[0:18:26-0:18:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:18:26):**  what she's avoiding is huge kind of information.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:18:30):**  Then more broadly, we did studies of this, where mom goes, habitat selection.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:18:35):**  All those are ways to functionally link animals to landscapes.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:18:41):**  People often talk about genetics and the genetics of their herd or we talk about humans in the  
**[0:18:46-0:18:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:18:46):**  sense of where we came from.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:18:50):**  I think what we don't think about much is that the social cultural part is all the tremendous  
**[0:18:59-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:18:59):**  amount of learning that's taking place is huge in terms of us being able to be functionally  
**[0:19:07-0:19:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:19:07):**  linked in wholesome ways with landscapes.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:19:10):**  I love this emerging field of epigenetics because it so fits the 35 years of research  
**[0:19:17-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:19:17):**  on how experience and culture enable animals to adapt to ever-changing landscapes.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:19:24):**  The field of epigenetics is all about is genes being expressed as a function of experience.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:19:30):**  Genes are being turned on and off.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:19:32):**  We sure saw that in studies we did and looked at different organ systems.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:19:37):**  If a goat's reared on really poor quality diet, what's that do for the size and development  
**[0:19:43-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:19:43):**  of its room?  
**[0:19:44-0:19:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:19:44):**  My colleagues in Australia looked at what happens if you rear sheep on salt brush.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:19:51):**  Does that change them as a result of experience in your early life?  
**[0:19:56-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:19:56):**  It does.  
**[0:19:57-0:19:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:19:57):**  It functions.  
**[0:19:58-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:19:58):**  Form and function is changed.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:19:59):**  These organ systems are changing as a function of experience and those are epigenetic kind  
**[0:20:06-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:20:06):**  of changes.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:20:09):**  Genes being turned on and off as a function of experience.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:20:12):**  It's the flavor feedback relationships.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:20:16):**  It's the diversity of different foods and the social cultural things that are really  
**[0:20:22-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:20:22):**  the linchpins of nutritional wisdom.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:20:24):**  It doesn't matter whether you're talking about a goat or a human being.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:20:28):**  Those same things matter hugely.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:20:31):**  I really like how you make the comparison between livestock fed on corn or other concentrates  
**[0:20:38-0:20:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:20:38):**  and the modern diet where a lot of people are eating highly processed, extra salted,  
**[0:20:44-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:20:44):**  low quality food that really kind of helps us to grow a lot physically but probably leaves  
**[0:20:51-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:20:51):**  us very undernourished at the same time.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:20:56):**  Those three main points that you made earlier, how can we sort of consciously get back to  
**[0:21:00-0:21:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:21:00):**  those if we're coming from an already compromised place that may have removed us from the intuition  
**[0:21:06-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:21:06):**  that could have gotten us there?  
**[0:21:08-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:21:08):**  I think the key Oliver, and I know it's not easy but I also have a really close friend  
**[0:21:17-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:21:17):**  who worked for me actually as an undergraduate who went on to medical school then and is  
**[0:21:23-0:21:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:21:23):**  a medical doctor who's absolutely right on top of everything that we're talking about  
**[0:21:29-0:21:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:21:29):**  now.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:21:30):**  It's just so encouraging to visit with him about the way he takes patients that are clearly  
**[0:21:36-0:21:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:21:36):**  overweight or obese and he says, and they come in with various ailments, he says, well  
**[0:21:44-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:21:44):**  look, the first thing we've got to do is get your diet right because odds are all these  
**[0:21:49-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:21:49):**  problems that you're having are going to go away.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:21:52):**  That's not always the case but probably, I don't want to put words in his mouth but I  
**[0:21:57-0:22:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:21:57):**  bet it's 90% of the time the issues go away when the diet gets right, the diet and the  
**[0:22:03-0:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:22:03):**  health and the loss of weight.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:22:05):**  And really wholesome foods are the key, avoiding the processed foods and I know this, I'm spouting  
**[0:22:12-0:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:22:12):**  these words out like it's simple, I know that that's not necessarily the case but getting  
**[0:22:17-0:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:22:17):**  on wholesome foods, fruits, vegetables, meat that comes from, I think I really think there's  
**[0:22:32-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:22:32):**  a value in whatever the meat is, whether it's poultry or pork or beef that comes from landscapes,  
**[0:22:44-0:22:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:22:44):**  the grass fed kind of, the quote grass fed, you know there again I think the greater the  
**[0:22:50-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:22:50):**  diversity of plants and foods that are in the diets of the animals we eat, that gets  
**[0:22:55-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:22:55):**  into their meat and milk and that has huge implications for us too.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:23:00):**  So having foods, plants and animals that are as wholesome as a person can get, one of the  
**[0:23:13-0:23:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:23:13):**  things I think about a lot nowadays, we've selected, and I don't blame, this is no blame  
**[0:23:21-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:23:21):**  in anything I'm saying and I don't know much of anything to do so but when you compare  
**[0:23:30-0:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:23:30):**  the wild plants, when you compare them, their phytochemical richness, not only energy protein  
**[0:23:38-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:23:38):**  minerals but all these secondary compounds that, you know who cares the names of them  
**[0:23:43-0:23:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:23:43):**  actually there's thousands of them, alkaloids, terpenoids, phenolics, that doesn't matter  
**[0:23:49-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:23:49):**  so much, what matters is that they're in these wild plants and they have so many health benefits.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:23:58):**  Unfortunately in our selection processes we've selected for yield, yield has trumped phytochemical  
**[0:24:05-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:24:05):**  richness and that's not good in the vegetables and the fruits that we eat and there's studies,  
**[0:24:13-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:24:13):**  reviews that show that the chemical richness of plants that we eat has diminished by what  
**[0:24:19-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:24:19):**  10 to 50% over the last half a century or so, so trying to find wholesome varieties  
**[0:24:29-0:24:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:24:29):**  of foods in the grocery store, if you can grow your own to me that's sure what my wife  
**[0:24:36-0:24:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:24:36):**  and I have done for our whole lives is just try to grow but trying to find varieties,  
**[0:24:42-0:24:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:24:42):**  whether it's heirloom or whatever that are rich, my wife soon I had that soul revealed  
**[0:24:48-0:24:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:24:48):**  again to us this fall. We're living here in Montana and there's just a huge array of different  
**[0:24:55-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:24:55):**  kind of fruits that come on as you go through the summer and into the fall, probably you  
**[0:25:00-0:25:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:25:00):**  can go for a hike and eat 10 different fruits that are on these plants but the fruits have  
**[0:25:05-0:25:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:25:05):**  a lot of punch to them, you know they're not just sweet, they have a lot, when you put  
**[0:25:11-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:25:11):**  them in your mouth you know there's just a lot of punch to those things whether it's  
**[0:25:15-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:25:15):**  chokes cherries or service berries or huckleberries or buffalo berry, we found a whole bunch of  
**[0:25:24-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:25:24):**  buffalo berries and they really, to me they have a great flavour but it's a strong flavour  
**[0:25:30-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:25:30):**  and it's those phytochemicals and like I said those chemicals that are in those plants that  
**[0:25:39-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:25:39):**  when you eat them and they get into your bloodstream that allows cells to select what they need  
**[0:25:45-0:25:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:25:45):**  for their health, that's what helps to keep cells healthy. To come back to your question,  
**[0:25:52-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:25:52):**  you know I'm wondering around but I think it's trying to get wholesome foods, wholesome  
**[0:25:56-0:26:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:25:56):**  plants, whether that's fruits and produce, both those and animals that are raised on  
**[0:26:04-0:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:26:04):**  pastures in areas that have a really diverse array of different plants, all that gets into  
**[0:26:12-0:26:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:26:12):**  creating a wholesome diet and just trying, you know the really insidious kind of thing  
**[0:26:20-0:26:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:26:20):**  about the processed foods is that they hit you with a blast of energy basically that's  
**[0:26:27-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:26:27):**  really readily available and we like that, it's reinforcing blast off like that, you  
**[0:26:33-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:26:33):**  know animals like that blast of energy but it's too much when we extract and purify compounds  
**[0:26:41-0:26:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:26:41):**  like high fructose corn soap, that blast of energy becomes, you know even to the point  
**[0:26:45-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:26:45):**  of addiction, there's a pretty good case that some folks make that sugar is addicting, so  
**[0:26:53-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:26:53):**  it becomes too much. Then what's really kind of devious about the thing is we enrich and  
**[0:26:58-0:27:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:26:58):**  fortify those things with compounds that we would be able to get from more wholesome foods  
**[0:27:05-0:27:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:27:05):**  so it really kind of sets us up to be junkies, you know food junkies. There's a chapter in  
**[0:27:12-0:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:27:12):**  the book because you know how to poison a rat, cow or human being and it's really about  
**[0:27:16-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:27:16):**  all of that, how all that the immediate positive consequences and the delayed negative consequences  
**[0:27:22-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:27:22):**  really get us.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:27:24):**  Well back to what you talked about too of how that this can create an imbalance or rebalance  
**[0:27:30-0:27:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:27:30):**  the microbiome within the system, a lot of the addictive qualities of some of these concentrated  
**[0:27:37-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:27:37):**  foods or refined foods like sugars are just completely throwing the microbiome out of  
**[0:27:43-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:27:43):**  whack if I understand it correctly and this is what causes cravings in the body and sort  
**[0:27:48-0:27:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:27:48):**  of a feeling of need for certain types of food, not so much because your body wants  
**[0:27:53-0:27:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:27:53):**  it but because the imbalance of bacteria in various parts of your gut system are telling  
**[0:27:59-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:27:59):**  you that that's what it needs to survive.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:28:01):**  Yeah exactly, you know what the microbiome is really is the hot topic nowadays in human  
**[0:28:11-0:28:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:28:11):**  nutrition people are really on that but you know Oliver in with domestic animals, cattle,  
**[0:28:18-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:28:18):**  sheep, goats what are referred to as ruminants, they have this ruminant digestive system.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:28:23):**  You know people have known about the microbiome for 50, 60, 70 years now that in ruminant  
**[0:28:28-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:28:28):**  nutrition that has been a huge, huge, huge deal and what's absolutely clear and in ecology  
**[0:28:35-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:28:35):**  as well and you know ecologists have studied this too and what they learned that you're  
**[0:28:42-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:28:42):**  alluding to so nicely is that the diet you select favors different microbial populations,  
**[0:28:49-0:28:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:28:49):**  it's just a fact you know you have thousands of these different micro, different species  
**[0:28:54-0:29:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:28:54):**  of microbes and some prefer certain things, others prefer certain things and you know  
**[0:29:01-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:29:01):**  one of the arguments for back in the day that ecologists made for eating a variety of, for  
**[0:29:07-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:29:07):**  the roles that secondary compounds play in limiting intake of any one food and causing  
**[0:29:13-0:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:29:13):**  to eat a variety of foods is that maintains a balance of different microbes in the system  
**[0:29:21-0:29:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:29:21):**  so some microbes may be able to do okay on tannins, other ones on terpenes, other ones  
**[0:29:25-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:29:25):**  on alkaloids on and on and on and on but if you have a variety of foods you'll maintain  
**[0:29:33-0:29:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:29:33):**  a more diverse microbial population.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:29:35):**  Well if you go to a really processed diet and high in starch and refined carbohydrates  
**[0:29:44-0:29:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:29:44):**  then you're selecting for certain kind of microbes.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:29:47):**  We know to use an analogy from the feedlot so say you've got this goat since we've been  
**[0:29:53-0:29:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:29:53):**  talking about goats it's out there, or cows may be better, it doesn't matter, you've got  
**[0:29:59-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:29:59):**  an animal that's out on a rangeland that's eating 30, 40, 50 different plant species  
**[0:30:04-0:30:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:30:04):**  maybe 3 to 5 make up the bulk of the diet at any one point but it's going to sample  
**[0:30:08-0:30:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:30:08):**  a whole bunch of others, it's got a really diverse kind of microbiome.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:30:13):**  Now you take it and you put it in the feedlot what happens is all those bacteria that were  
**[0:30:19-0:30:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:30:19):**  thriving on all those different plant species now no longer have the food that they need.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:30:25):**  You put them on a high grain diet and you start to favor these starch digesting bacteria  
**[0:30:30-0:30:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:30:30):**  so that's analogous to what you're saying with the human diet, same sort of deal.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:30:37):**  And you know it's I think a key thing to realize though it's not just the microbiome it is  
**[0:30:46-0:30:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:30:46):**  also these cells and organ systems come to use that then as their energy source for instance  
**[0:30:52-0:30:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:30:52):**  until you finally become diabetic or the point you've overloaded the cells with energy to  
**[0:30:57-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:30:57):**  the point they can't even deal with it anymore.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:31:01):**  So that leads me to think that with these different feedback loops based on balances  
**[0:31:06-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:31:06):**  or imbalances within the microbiome within the cellular activity of various different  
**[0:31:12-0:31:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:31:12):**  organs of the body a healthy body is giving you all sorts of feedback to reinforce its  
**[0:31:18-0:31:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:31:18):**  health and give you the nutrition that you need or possibly even the medicine if you  
**[0:31:22-0:31:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:31:22):**  find yourself sort of falling out of balance.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:31:25):**  But what about for a lot of us who for I guess lack of a better term are living with chronic  
**[0:31:31-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:31:31):**  illness or some sort of diminished state of health we're probably receiving tons of different  
**[0:31:40-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:31:40):**  negative or incorrect pieces of information and feedback from our system.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:31:45):**  How do we correct that.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:31:47):**  Is it a matter of just forcing yourself to eat more highly nutritious food until your  
**[0:31:51-0:31:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:31:51):**  body gives you correct feedback or is there other signs that we can look for.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:31:56):**  You know I think that's part of it and I'm going back to the medical doctor that I was  
**[0:32:02-0:32:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:32:02):**  mentioning earlier that uses nutrition as the base is really the basis to start with  
**[0:32:09-0:32:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:32:09):**  that.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:32:10):**  That's really the key is he works so hard to get people to remove all the refined foods  
**[0:32:18-0:32:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:32:18):**  from their diet and to get on to wholesome foods as we're talking.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:32:23):**  He's really an advocate too of growing your own foods you know getting out there growing  
**[0:32:27-0:32:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:32:27):**  a garden getting hands on involved with the whole process as part of health as well.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:32:35):**  The broader issues of health and you know as he says most of the issues go away once  
**[0:32:43-0:32:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:32:43):**  a person does that and it can take time.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:32:46):**  I've also seen that they have some groups that meet on a weekly basis to talk about  
**[0:32:54-0:33:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:32:54):**  issues and to try to reinforce one another to try to help one another in that to go through  
**[0:33:00-0:33:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:33:00):**  that I guess what you'd call adaptation trough to get weaned off of all the processed food  
**[0:33:05-0:33:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:33:05):**  and to get on to the more wholesome foods.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:33:12):**  You know I haven't worked as closely with individuals nearly as closely as he does that's  
**[0:33:17-0:33:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:33:17):**  what he does is his practice so I feel a little bit I start to get out of my depth in terms  
**[0:33:23-0:33:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:33:23):**  of you know saying anything that would be strong recommendations.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:33:28):**  I've talked with him though about well how long does it take and it varies with the individual  
**[0:33:33-0:33:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:33:33):**  which makes sense how long it takes to kind of wean yourself off of that.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:33:39):**  But one of the things that's clear is that once people get off of the junk and really  
**[0:33:44-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:33:44):**  get off of the junk they don't want to go back.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:33:48):**  The wholesome foods become so important.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:33:51):**  Another thing I find really interesting that he and I talk about too is that you know if  
**[0:33:57-0:34:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:33:57):**  you can figure out for yourself where to get wholesome foods whether it's growing them  
**[0:34:04-0:34:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:34:04):**  yourself or which place you source those from we both think that the amount of food that  
**[0:34:13-0:34:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:34:13):**  a person eats actually goes down.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:34:16):**  And if you can create nourishing meals and nourishing combinations of foods that you  
**[0:34:22-0:34:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:34:22):**  actually eat less because you aren't over ingesting foods to try to meet needs for limiting  
**[0:34:28-0:34:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:34:28):**  nutrients I don't know if that makes sense or not but you know.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:34:32):**  Yeah that makes a lot of sense to me.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:34:35):**  I got to tell you I'm well known in our group here on the farm for being the one who eats  
**[0:34:39-0:34:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:34:39):**  the most.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:34:40):**  And I've had a history of digestive problems my entire adult life and it's very clear to  
**[0:34:44-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:34:44):**  all of us that I'm not making use of all of the food that I'm consuming although we are  
**[0:34:49-0:34:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:34:49):**  increasingly having a diet that comes straight from our farm.  
**[0:34:53-0:34:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:34:53):**  And I notice that when I'm eating more things that come from our garden directly either  
**[0:34:58-0:35:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:34:58):**  it's the goat products the dairy products that we produce the things that come directly  
**[0:35:02-0:35:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:35:02):**  out of the garden everything from sweet potatoes to corn to you know all variety of veggies.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:35:08):**  I do start to eat less as well and have less sort of hunger pains throughout the day.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:35:14):**  So this really resonates with me particularly.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:35:17):**  No I think that's the key.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:35:18):**  And you know nobody can tell you Oliver what I think that's what's so interesting to me  
**[0:35:24-0:35:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:35:24):**  and you know there's a chapter in there upfront in the book no two alike which makes the point  
**[0:35:29-0:35:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:35:29):**  that every one of us each one of us is absolutely unique not just to say that as some sort of  
**[0:35:35-0:35:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:35:35):**  latitude or whatever.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:35:36):**  It's so important to realize so nobody can tell you just what what to do in that sense  
**[0:35:43-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:35:43):**  you have to experiment.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:35:45):**  But I think if you if you do and you know what you were just saying I love what you  
**[0:35:50-0:35:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:35:50):**  just said.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:35:51):**  I think you you'll come to figure for your body what works and what's satisfying you  
**[0:35:58-0:36:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:35:58):**  know so that after you eat a meal you just feel oh you know you don't you just you're  
**[0:36:05-0:36:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:36:05):**  not you don't have these these cravings or you know you don't feel satisfied it's just  
**[0:36:11-0:36:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:36:11):**  that whole idea of being satisfied and and less can equal more if there's a richness  
**[0:36:17-0:36:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:36:17):**  a wholesome richness of the biochemical that are our body needs.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:36:22):**  I think that and then and those are those signals then that that that we all experience  
**[0:36:27-0:36:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:36:27):**  as as satiety to use that term you know that that feeling of not fullness but just being  
**[0:36:36-0:36:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:36:36):**  being really satisfied after a meal and I think we each have to work to figure that  
**[0:36:41-0:36:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:36:41):**  out and probably changes our whole life.  
**[0:36:43-0:36:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:36:43):**  I'm no spring chicken anymore.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:36:46):**  You know I think you have to you know it's just what you said earlier on when your animals  
**[0:36:52-0:36:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:36:52):**  are pregnant their needs are different when they have when they have their babies they've  
**[0:36:57-0:37:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:36:57):**  got huge needs for lactation huge amount of energy required and so on and so forth.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:37:01):**  And as we age our needs change and so you know it's something that we we just always  
**[0:37:08-0:37:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:37:08):**  have to be aware of and you know and I think experimenting maybe what worked before before  
**[0:37:16-0:37:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:37:16):**  when we're younger that needs to change some.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:37:20):**  And I always used to laugh when we were doing our studies people say well our tastes change  
**[0:37:24-0:37:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:37:24):**  as we age and that's that's absolutely the case and what that's reflecting to me is that  
**[0:37:31-0:37:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:37:31):**  our needs are changing as we age as well.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:37:34):**  Yeah absolutely I've heard that echoed from a couple of different sources.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:37:37):**  Now let's switch gears just for a second here because there was another idea that I wanted  
**[0:37:41-0:37:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:37:41):**  to talk to you about and that's the difference between eating locally and having you know  
**[0:37:46-0:37:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:37:46):**  even if it is nutritionally dense food imported from outside what that can do to sort of disconnect  
**[0:37:52-0:37:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:37:52):**  us from our own environment.  
**[0:37:53-0:37:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:37:53):**  Do you have any experience with this.  
**[0:37:55-0:38:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:37:55):**  I know you've grown a lot of your own food for much of your life as well.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:38:00):**  I think there's so many rewards and you know I don't know why.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:38:04):**  Well my wife and I were on the ranch for several years I was there for throughout undergrad  
**[0:38:11-0:38:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:38:11):**  most of that well all of that actually and then I stayed on ran the ranch and soon I  
**[0:38:16-0:38:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:38:16):**  were married out there from when we first met we liked growing gardens.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:38:20):**  Don't ask me why I don't know I don't know but we just thought it was neat.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:38:23):**  We thought the way those old people did that stuff was really neat.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:38:28):**  So we did that our whole life.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:38:30):**  We grew our own gardens we raised our own animals and slaughtered them and I think that  
**[0:38:38-0:38:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:38:38):**  you know that participation in what you eat is really grounding and centering for us anyway.  
**[0:38:45-0:38:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:38:45):**  It has been having to kill the animals that you eat you know you make sure you realize  
**[0:38:52-0:38:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:38:52):**  how sacred life is.  
**[0:38:54-0:39:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:38:54):**  That's not easy to do that but then again not to wear out the book but there's a chapter  
**[0:39:01-0:39:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:39:01):**  on plants and a chapter that deals with plants.  
**[0:39:05-0:39:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:39:05):**  Plants are conscious you know that and that's not just saying that out of woo-wee-wee kind  
**[0:39:09-0:39:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:39:09):**  of stuff there's some amazing kind of research.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:39:12):**  Well everything's alive it's all conscious and so is that participation in life that  
**[0:39:20-0:39:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:39:20):**  I think is when you get hands-on involved with growing your own food even if it's just  
**[0:39:26-0:39:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:39:26):**  a little basis.  
**[0:39:27-0:39:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:39:27):**  Now where we live here we're able to we have vegetable gardens and herbal gardens and medicinal  
**[0:39:37-0:39:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:39:37):**  gardens my wife has just gotten so much into those kind of into the medicinal kind of gardens  
**[0:39:45-0:39:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:39:45):**  and you know it just it's an amazingly neat thing and way to I think to ground ourselves  
**[0:39:55-0:40:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:39:55):**  and when we can do that and then supporting local people we don't grow our own animals  
**[0:40:02-0:40:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:40:02):**  anymore but we know many people around us that do and so we buy our meat from those  
**[0:40:10-0:40:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:40:10):**  folks that are doing such an amazing job of raising animals and taking care of the landscapes  
**[0:40:20-0:40:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:40:20):**  that those animals come from.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:40:23):**  So I see so much value in doing that not that not that everyone can do that but I think  
**[0:40:30-0:40:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nourishment/#t=0:40:30):**  to the degree that any of us can it's a really grounding centering kind of activity that

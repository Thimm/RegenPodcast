**[0:05:02-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:05:02):**  did not go up to Scotland looking to buy a farm.

**[0:05:13-0:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:05:13):**  And in fact, in the book that we've just written, the very first sentence is, we never meant

**[0:05:22-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:05:22):**  And it was 2012.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:05:23):**  It was the year that Sandra and I met.

**[0:05:35-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:05:35):**  So really kind of practical outdoorsy kind of role.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:05:40):**  And we were apprentices.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:05:41):**  So we were learning kind of on the job about nature and ecology and all that kind of thing.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:05:46):**  And I think pretty early on from when we met, we had this itch, right.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:05:50):**  And this itch was to live really kind of closer to the land.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:05:54):**  You know, we were in jobs that were quite nice, that were quite practical, that were  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:05:58):**  quite nature based, but we really wanted to, yeah, live a kind of a life that was closer  
**[0:06:03-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:06:03):**  to the land, grow our own food.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:06:06):**  You know, really a dream that so many people have, right.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:06:09):**  Especially today, so many people have this dream.

**[0:06:15-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:06:15):**  So about two years after being together, we decided to really make kind of a bit of a  
**[0:06:20-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:06:20):**  crazy leap and leave our jobs.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:06:23):**  And we decided to head north to Scotland.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:06:25):**  And the reason why we were kind of moving to Scotland was because, well, Sandra has  
**[0:06:28-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:06:28):**  some family connection there.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:06:30):**  Her mother's from Scotland.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:06:32):**  So there was that.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:06:33):**  But basically, it was affordability and availability of land, right, which is the biggest challenge,  
**[0:06:38-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:06:38):**  certainly in this country, that new entrant farmers face.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:06:40):**  So we thought, right, we've got to go where the land is available, where we've got a chance  
**[0:06:44-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:06:44):**  of buying some.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:06:46):**  Found ourselves in Scotland and spent two years just kind of living in the area.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:06:50):**  We were working as tree planters, really immersed in that time and the whole rewilding movement.  
**[0:06:56-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:06:56):**  But at weekends, we were going to look for land.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:06:58):**  So we were literally looking on the open market.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:07:01):**  And we were looking for about five acres, OK?  
**[0:07:04-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:07:04):**  So the vision was chickens, kitchen garden.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:07:09):**  And we basically would make some seasonal money from running a few camping plots, a  
**[0:07:14-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:07:14):**  little bit of diversification, that kind of thing.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:07:16):**  But the focus was always about us growing our own food and being closer to nature.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:07:21):**  So we start looking.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:07:23):**  We find Limbrecht Croft, which is the land that we now live and are guardians of, and  
**[0:07:29-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:07:29):**  didn't have the money to buy it.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:07:30):**  We managed to overcome that by getting a kind of basically empty in every pot that we had  
**[0:07:34-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:07:34):**  and a loan from a friend.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:07:37):**  So that was one kind of challenge we overcome.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:07:39):**  But the second challenge was that it was 150 acres.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:07:42):**  So it was much bigger than what we'd ever intended on buying.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:07:46):**  And that's because really, we just fell in love with the place.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:07:49):**  So we found ourselves here.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:07:52):**  We had no background in agriculture, like no formal training, no really kind of direct  
**[0:07:58-0:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:07:58):**  experience.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:07:59):**  And we didn't have any direct experience either in setting up and running a business.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:08:04):**  So we had a decision to make.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:08:06):**  So the decision was, do we do what we originally wanted to do, which was chickens, veggie garden,  
**[0:08:12-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:08:12):**  a few camping spots, and then leave the other kind of 149 and a half acres to just do its  
**[0:08:17-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:08:17):**  own thing?  
**[0:08:19-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:08:19):**  Or do we actually do all of that, plus see if there's a way that we can actually take  
**[0:08:26-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:08:26):**  our passion for growing food and do that across the other 149 and a half acres, but do it  
**[0:08:31-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:08:31):**  in a way that's really beneficial for the land?  
**[0:08:34-0:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:08:34):**  Because we had all this nature ecology practical experience and do it in a way where we can  
**[0:08:39-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:08:39):**  benefit the local community and provide food for them.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:08:42):**  So that's really the point at which we got to where we then thought, right, how do we  
**[0:08:48-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:08:48):**  do this?  
**[0:08:49-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:08:49):**  And what kind of farmers are we going to become?  
**[0:08:50-0:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:08:50):**  Well, I'm curious, take a step back a little bit with this original idea of having a much  
**[0:08:55-0:09:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:08:55):**  more manageable farm and then making the leap to a much larger commitment to this.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:09:02):**  Did you start with some clear criteria of what you were looking for and then just throw  
**[0:09:06-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:09:06):**  it out the window?  
**[0:09:07-0:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:09:07):**  Or were there a few key things that were present that were not present on, let's say, smaller  
**[0:09:11-0:09:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:09:11):**  plots that helped you make that decision and decide to really invest in something that  
**[0:09:16-0:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:09:16):**  perhaps you didn't think you had the resources for in the beginning?  
**[0:09:21-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:09:21):**  So I think really our criteria, I mean, really, honestly, our criteria was pretty loose because  
**[0:09:25-0:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:09:25):**  we were really driven by what we could afford at the end of the day.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:09:30):**  So obviously, we ended up stretching that quite a bit in terms of what we ended up kind  
**[0:09:35-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:09:35):**  of buying and where we ended up becoming.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:09:38):**  But a lot of it was dictated by that.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:09:41):**  We were always really conscious to buy somewhere that had a good location.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:09:46):**  And I think it's interesting, actually, when I reflect on that now, because we did give  
**[0:09:50-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:09:50):**  that quite a high priority.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:09:52):**  And I think reflecting on it now, there was something in our heads that was saying, you  
**[0:09:57-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:09:57):**  need to be in a good location, because if you're going to have people coming to you,  
**[0:10:01-0:10:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:10:01):**  you need to be easily accessible.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:10:03):**  If you're going to be in a good location, if you do have things to sell, you need to  
**[0:10:07-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:10:07):**  be in a place where people can easily access your produce.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:10:11):**  So I think early on, there was some seed in there that was set, that then it's kind of  
**[0:10:16-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:10:16):**  grown into Limbrech.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:10:19):**  But really, I think what's interesting, thinking about, say, if we'd have come at this from  
**[0:10:23-0:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:10:23):**  a farming background, we would have been looking at the type of land that we would have been  
**[0:10:30-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:10:30):**  buying in terms of its ability to grow crops or the type of grassland.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:10:35):**  Here in the UK, it's all about kind of improved productive grassland.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:10:38):**  We would have had all these kind of preconceptions in our head.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:10:41):**  We didn't have any of that.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:10:42):**  All we had was this basic understanding of nature, the understanding that nature is diverse,  
**[0:10:48-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:10:48):**  and the acceptance that that is a really great thing.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:10:51):**  And what we found at Limbrech was a diverse land holding, not just in terms of habitats,  
**[0:10:57-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:10:57):**  but in terms of species diversity.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:10:59):**  So we saw this as the land of milk and honey.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:11:02):**  We saw this as the land of opportunity.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:11:05):**  Other farmers will come here, and they will look at it, and they will say, how on earth  
**[0:11:09-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:11:09):**  do you produce anything here?  
**[0:11:10-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:11:10):**  How on earth do you grow anything here?  
**[0:11:13-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:11:13):**  If we'd have come at it with that point of view, we never would have achieved to grow  
**[0:11:18-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:11:18):**  the kind of business that we have done here.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:11:20):**  So I think actually our loose criteria was actually really quite efficient in the long  
**[0:11:27-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:11:27):**  term, but it gave us the flexibility that had we have come from, say, mainstream ag,  
**[0:11:33-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:11:33):**  we wouldn't have had.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:11:35):**  Yeah, that makes sense.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:11:37):**  And I'm wondering if you had, once you kind of made the decision to get this larger piece  
**[0:11:41-0:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:11:41):**  of land, did you have the confidence that you could turn this into a series of enterprises  
**[0:11:46-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:11:46):**  that could support at least paying back the loan for the land and a livelihood for both  
**[0:11:50-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:11:50):**  of you to stay there full time?  
**[0:11:52-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:11:52):**  Or did it take a lot of work for that to unfold and get developed?

**[0:12:01-0:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:12:01):**  I would say that we didn't have confidence, but we had belief.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:12:07):**  And I think there's a real difference in that because we looked at land and we had no idea  
**[0:12:12-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:12:12):**  what we were going to do, but we believed that this was possible.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:12:15):**  We just didn't know how.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:12:17):**  And some people might say that that's naive, it's blinkered, it's whatever.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:12:20):**  But I think it's whenever you listen to your gut and it's whenever you listen to your heart  
**[0:12:23-0:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:12:23):**  and your instinct and you think something here is right, something here is good.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:12:27):**  I now need to see what I've got and work with it.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:12:30):**  And I think that's really what we did.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:12:33):**  The confidence came later.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:12:35):**  So we started off basically, we've moved to a new place.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:12:38):**  We don't know anybody.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:12:40):**  We don't know the landscape.

**[0:12:42-0:12:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:12:42):**  We don't know the people.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:12:43):**  We don't know the community.

**[0:12:52-0:12:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:12:52):**  who aren't in farming, but meeting people who are in farming as well.  
**[0:12:55-0:12:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:12:55):**  And we start to ask them questions and we start to say, what do you think of this?  
**[0:12:59-0:13:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:12:59):**  What do you do?  
**[0:13:00-0:13:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:13:00):**  What's the challenges in this area like?  
**[0:13:03-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:13:03):**  And start to ask questions.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:13:04):**  We then start to use that information and we try and match it up with our practical  
**[0:13:10-0:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:13:10):**  ecology experience.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:13:11):**  So we're saying, okay, that neighbor or that farmer is advising us to deep plow.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:13:16):**  Okay, so what does my nature experience tell me?  
**[0:13:19-0:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:13:19):**  Well, my nature experience tells me that actually soil, we shouldn't really disturb soil.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:13:23):**  We should keep it covered.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:13:24):**  So you're starting to see these two kind of approaches and you're starting to compare  
**[0:13:29-0:13:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:13:29):**  them both and then whittle them down into the path that we eventually took.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:13:32):**  But to begin with, we were terrified because we had so many people.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:13:36):**  You know what it's like in farming, no two farms are the same.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:13:38):**  No two farmers are the same.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:13:39):**  So everybody does everything differently.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:13:42):**  So they're going, oh yeah, you've got to plow it.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:13:45):**  And then somebody else going, oh no, you've got to disc it.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:13:47):**  And then somebody else is saying, oh no, this is full of thatch, you've got to burn it.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:13:50):**  And then somebody else is saying, oh, you've got to harrow it.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:13:53):**  And you're just trying to work through all this kind of incredible sort of generosity  
**[0:13:58-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:13:58):**  of knowledge.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:13:59):**  But you're matching that within what is the system, this wonderful system that is nature  
**[0:14:05-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:14:05):**  and how it does things naturally.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:14:07):**  And that's what we were kind of trying to do.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:14:09):**  So the more we got the information, the more we kind of compared the two, we started to  
**[0:14:14-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:14:14):**  get more of a clarity in terms of how we would progress here and how we would build the business  
**[0:14:21-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:14:21):**  up.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:14:22):**  Early on, we had to, in order to access, we managed to get a bit of grant funding early  
**[0:14:27-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:14:27):**  on.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:14:28):**  And early on, we had to write a business plan.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:14:29):**  And we had to basically start to piece all of this stuff together quite early.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:14:34):**  And it's interesting now reflecting on that business plan because it's completely different  
**[0:14:38-0:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:14:38):**  from what we now do.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:14:39):**  But it's actually very similar in that it was all based on the fundamentals of diversification  
**[0:14:46-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:14:46):**  of product, produce, which required diversification of animals and all of which would be directly  
**[0:14:53-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:14:53):**  sold by us through telling our story.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:14:57):**  And so once we kind of got all of those pieces in place, the confidence started to build.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:15:03):**  I have to be completely honest with you, right?  
**[0:15:05-0:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:15:05):**  We've been doing this for six years now.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:15:07):**  I still feel unconfident sometimes in what we're doing because sometimes we've never  
**[0:15:14-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:15:14):**  been the kind of people that do what everybody else does, ever been that.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:15:19):**  And sometimes you do have those kind of moments where you just go, is this all, I mean, is  
**[0:15:25-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:15:25):**  it really going to work?  
**[0:15:27-0:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:15:27):**  You feel so kind of out there.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:15:30):**  But equally, we could never do it any other way.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:15:32):**  So the confidence is growing, but we're not like, yeah, this is 100% how you do everything.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:15:38):**  Because we still kind of go, ah, I'm not sure it is.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:15:41):**  It's so good to admit that.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:15:42):**  And I think anybody who says that they're really confident, especially from such an  
**[0:15:47-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:15:47):**  early stage, is either lying or delusional.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:15:50):**  It takes a long time to build that up.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:15:52):**  And then, of course, all of the variables that come into running a farm business get  
**[0:15:56-0:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:15:56):**  thrown at you and your confidence is reset again.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:16:01):**  But I'd like to unpack that a little bit more of the process that you went to, because it  
**[0:16:06-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:16:06):**  sounds like all of the advice that you mentioned are none of the things that you've actually  
**[0:16:10-0:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:16:10):**  done.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:16:11):**  And I mean, it's very useful to have a background in ecology.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:16:18):**  But in my own work with farmers and farming myself, ecology will get you to a certain  
**[0:16:23-0:16:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:16:23):**  point, but it won't necessarily pay the bills.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:16:26):**  And if you're just working on reestablishing native habitat or bringing back certain plants,  
**[0:16:32-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:16:32):**  it's difficult to make a business out of that.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:16:35):**  It's difficult to bring in some sort of profit.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:16:38):**  How did you start to evaluate the enterprises that you currently have and make sure that  
**[0:16:42-0:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:16:42):**  there was some kind of financial return in them?  
**[0:16:45-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:16:45):**  So I think that's a really good question and a really good kind of point to go on to, because  
**[0:16:50-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:16:50):**  it's really emphasizing early on and something that we knew early on was that farming is  
**[0:16:57-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:16:57):**  a business.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:16:58):**  OK, we can do all this incredible stuff.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:17:00):**  We can do all you know, we can be regenerative.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:17:02):**  We can build soil.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:17:03):**  We can increase invertebrate numbers.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:17:06):**  We can feed people.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:17:08):**  It's great.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:17:09):**  It's we can do incredible stuff, but it's a business.

**[0:17:29-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:17:29):**  it has to be able to stand on its own two feet.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:17:31):**  Now the reason why I make this point is because certainly in the UK, in this country, the

**[0:17:42-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:17:42):**  You can get all these other grants.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:17:44):**  And we've been pretty good at getting some of these other grants, which are like a capital  
**[0:17:46-0:17:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:17:46):**  grant for like a project.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:17:48):**  So building a barn or putting in fences or whatever.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:17:51):**  And they're like a fixed grant for a fixed project.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:17:53):**  And you do it and then you're done.  
**[0:17:56-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:17:56):**  You kind of tick the box.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:17:57):**  But most farms rely on these annual basic payments.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:18:01):**  And without them, their business would simply flounder.

**[0:18:12-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:18:12):**  The subsidies are just propping them up.

**[0:18:19-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:18:19):**  And I think that's what I'm kind of building up into here is that a lot of what we do is,  
**[0:18:25-0:18:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:18:25):**  is that obvious and does it make sense?  
**[0:18:26-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:18:26):**  And does it cost money?  
**[0:18:27-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:18:27):**  Okay.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:18:28):**  These are kind of mantras that we repeat all the time.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:18:31):**  So we're looking at different enterprises and we're thinking, okay, what's easy to start  
**[0:18:36-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:18:36):**  up that costs very little money that we can shift easily and that has a big audience.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:18:42):**  So eggs, pastured eggs, easy because meat eaters eat them, vegetarians eat them.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:18:48):**  I call them, in food, they're like the equivalent of a gateway drug.

**[0:18:56-0:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:18:56):**  in more of what you do.  
**[0:18:58-0:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:18:58):**  So it's like eggs.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:18:59):**  So infrastructure is minimal.

**[0:19:25-0:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:19:25):**  one or two or three people a week that get hooked on your eggs and then they tell other

**[0:19:38-0:19:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:19:38):**  So we started on the eggs and we could easily, you know, we could start to number crunch  
**[0:19:43-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:19:43):**  them.

**[0:19:50-0:19:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:19:50):**  And that's what we did.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:19:51):**  So it was building up from 10 hens to 20 hens to 30 hens.  
**[0:19:55-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:19:55):**  Your question earlier about confidence, this was us growing in confidence.

**[0:20:45-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:20:45):**  club, really, really simple model whereby we looked at our local town and we put a heads  
**[0:20:50-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:20:50):**  up on Facebook and whatever.

**[0:20:57-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:20:57):**  You pay this amount per month and you'll get a box of eggs or two or three, how many you  
**[0:21:01-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:21:01):**  want delivered straight to your door, who's up for it.

**[0:21:07-0:21:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:21:07):**  That means that we can justify getting the first lot of hands, egg club grows arms and  
**[0:21:12-0:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:21:12):**  legs so we can get the next 35 hands.

**[0:21:24-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:21:24):**  You know, the whole time, what we're trying to do is, is wean ourselves off, off farm

**[0:21:42-0:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:21:42):**  So every time we took on a new enterprise, let's say, for example, our Highland cattle,  
**[0:21:48-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:21:48):**  it was, you know, it was looking at, well, what are we going to get from this?  
**[0:21:51-0:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:21:51):**  We're going to get, you know, a really nice produce.

**[0:23:55-0:23:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:23:55):**  You're trying to work with it.

**[0:23:58-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:23:58):**  And you're trying to work with your animal team to deliver those outcomes.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:24:02):**  So that's a little, that's a kind of a little kind of introduction as to how we started  
**[0:24:06-0:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:24:06):**  to think about things and then how we started to build it up from there.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:24:10):**  Amazing.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:24:11):**  And so you did a combination of both small trials in order to establish a little market  
**[0:24:16-0:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:24:16):**  and basically it starts to act as a marketing vehicle, especially in the case of the eggs,  
**[0:24:21-0:24:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:24:21):**  it sounds like.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:24:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:24:23):**  And it grows from there.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:24:24):**  Did you work to pre-sell the cattle that you brought on before you brought them on or was  
**[0:24:30-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:24:30):**  it something else that you started just small enough and started to develop the market through  
**[0:24:35-0:24:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:24:35):**  the expansion?  
**[0:24:37-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:24:37):**  So I would say, so the first time we sold beef, we just put one animal away to slaughter  
**[0:24:44-0:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:24:44):**  because we didn't really know, we were still very early in our kind of, people didn't really  
**[0:24:51-0:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:24:51):**  know a lot about what we were doing.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:24:52):**  So it was just one animal that we went to slaughter.  
**[0:24:55-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:24:55):**  We didn't know at that stage as well, anything about the butchery side of things.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:25:00):**  And I mean that in terms of, we've since progressed that and I'll talk about that in a little  
**[0:25:04-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:25:04):**  while, but we didn't know, I mean, whenever you go to a butcher, right.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:25:09):**  And you say, I've got a Highland cow or whatever, and they say, well, what do you want?  
**[0:25:12-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:25:12):**  And you just go, meat?  
**[0:25:15-0:25:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:25:15):**  You know, you don't, you don't, you don't, who knows what a butchery cut list looks like,  
**[0:25:20-0:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:25:20):**  right.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:25:21):**  You know, and so, so we were learning all that kind of stuff like, oh, well, sausages  
**[0:25:25-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:25:25):**  come from, sausage meat comes from here.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:25:26):**  This steak comes from here, or you can't have that because that goes into that.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:25:31):**  And so we had a lot of that to learn early on.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:25:35):**  And it was the same with pigs as well.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:25:36):**  We run rare beef pigs here as well.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:25:39):**  But we've now shifted to with the pigs.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:25:42):**  So we've, we've, we sent our first pigs off to slaughter in 2017.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:25:46):**  We've sent our first cattle to slaughter in 2018.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:25:49):**  We're now in 2022 with our pigs, we, we will part pre-sell because we do the butchery on  
**[0:25:55-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:25:55):**  site so we can control exactly what we're cutting, what, what our kind of produce is  
**[0:26:01-0:26:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:26:01):**  going to look like, the numbers of things that we're going to get.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:26:03):**  So we will pre-sell some of that.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:26:05):**  And that's just a really nice way of kind of getting that out of, out of, out of, out  
**[0:26:09-0:26:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:26:09):**  of the way.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:26:10):**  With the butcher, with the, with the beef, we, we part butcher and we still work with  
**[0:26:14-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:26:14):**  a professional butcher as well because it's a, it's a much more complicated animal.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:26:18):**  But we've built up our customer base so much now that, that last year we shifted, I think  
**[0:26:25-0:26:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:26:25):**  we did an autumn release of, of Highland beef.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:26:27):**  We shifted about 600 kilos of beef in an hour upon release.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:26:31):**  So what we've now kind of got, it's, it's, it's an interesting situation.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:26:35):**  Okay.

**[0:27:52-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:27:52):**  once you've established a market for the products that you make.

**[0:27:59-0:28:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:27:59):**  who teach online, do you expand or do you intensify?

**[0:28:08-0:28:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:28:08):**  goals of what you're trying to achieve with your farm, which I can tell are not to be

**[0:28:18-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:28:18):**  What are the defining aspects of your farm that help you make these types of critical  
**[0:28:23-0:28:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:28:23):**  decisions?  
**[0:28:25-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:28:25):**  So I guess there's a few things really.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:28:28):**  And I think, you know, all of this stems from the very first question that you asked me  
**[0:28:33-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:28:33):**  was, you know, how do we get to this point?  
**[0:28:34-0:28:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:28:34):**  What was our original vision?  
**[0:28:36-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:28:36):**  And our original vision still applies to what we do.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:28:39):**  Okay.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:28:40):**  So our, our basis here is to grow our own food.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:28:44):**  I think about this a lot and I think about farmers and farming a lot and where we're  
**[0:28:48-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:28:48):**  at in farming today.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:28:50):**  And I think, you know, really as a farmer, okay, if I, if I'm going to call myself a  
**[0:28:54-0:28:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:28:54):**  farmer, my expertise is growing and producing food.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:28:58):**  That's my absolute area of expertise, you know, so, so nobody's better than me because  
**[0:29:02-0:29:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:29:02):**  that's what I do every day.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:29:04):**  Therefore, in my head, my priority using my expertise would be to grow my own food, right?  
**[0:29:13-0:29:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:29:13):**  Because nobody does it better than me.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:29:15):**  Therefore, I can grow the absolute best food for myself.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:29:19):**  And if I can do that, then I'm fueling my body with really, really kind of good energy,  
**[0:29:24-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:29:24):**  really high nutrients, which is going to keep me physically healthy, mentally healthy to  
**[0:29:28-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:29:28):**  then kind of give me the energy that I need to run my farm business.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:29:32):**  So our, our, still at the core of what we do is growing our own food, our kitchen garden,  
**[0:29:37-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:29:37):**  our polytunnel.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:29:38):**  You know, we spend hours in the, you know, winter or in the autumn harvesting and dehydrating  
**[0:29:46-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:29:46):**  and preserving and all that kind of stuff.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:29:48):**  So that's still there.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:29:50):**  Everything is kind of grown out from that.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:29:52):**  It's kind of like, I guess our business model is kind of like a sunflower, right?  
**[0:29:55-0:29:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:29:55):**  You've got the kind of the seeds in the center and that's us.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:29:58):**  And that's, that's our group, that's our passion for growing food.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:30:00):**  You then have all these petals that come out of it and they are all around that kind of  
**[0:30:06-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:30:06):**  central focus, which is growing food.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:30:09):**  So you've got the beef enterprise, you've got the chicken, you know, the layers enterprise,  
**[0:30:14-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:30:14):**  you've got the honey enterprise, you've got the pork enterprise.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:30:17):**  We then diversify because we're really passionate about getting the story out there and reconnecting  
**[0:30:21-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:30:21):**  people with their food and the land.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:30:23):**  We then do tours, we wrote our own course.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:30:25):**  So it's public tours and private tours.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:30:28):**  We had an old building on site that we renovated that's now a long-term rental.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:30:33):**  You know, we do talks, we've just written the book.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:30:35):**  So everything kind of, there's lots of stuff that's all interconnected, but what I would  
**[0:30:39-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:30:39):**  say and this, this brings everything once again back to nature, is that it is my thinking  
**[0:30:45-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:30:45):**  that our business isn't just built on the foundations of working with nature.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:30:51):**  It's built on the foundation of what nature is.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:30:53):**  And nature is an inherently diverse, collaborative system.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:30:58):**  And so we like to run a business that is, you know, diverse and it's collaborative,  
**[0:31:04-0:31:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:31:04):**  not just the elements within each other, but outwith of that.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:31:08):**  So, you know, going back to the conversation of we don't produce enough people, we don't  
**[0:31:13-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:31:13):**  produce enough, you know, for the marketplace.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:31:17):**  Our kind of dream would be that there would be other little farms like ours in the area  
**[0:31:23-0:31:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:31:23):**  that would pop up and go, hey, I like what they're doing and that seems to work.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:31:27):**  So I'm going to go and talk to them and see if there's some way that we could work together.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:31:31):**  And so what we're doing is we're starting to kind of then build a collective of small  
**[0:31:35-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:31:35):**  farmers who are producing the kind of food that we have shown is in such high demand  
**[0:31:40-0:31:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:31:40):**  that we're not even scratching the surface of it.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:31:42):**  And it's food that people are willing to pay a price for that is closer to the value of  
**[0:31:47-0:31:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:31:47):**  what it truly costs to produce in a way in which you can make an economically viable  
**[0:31:52-0:31:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:31:52):**  living from it and you start to work together.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:31:56):**  So that's, you know, so that to me is what kind of farming with nature is all about,  
**[0:32:01-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:32:01):**  as well as that.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:32:02):**  So our vision is still food.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:32:03):**  Our vision will still be food.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:32:04):**  And I think as well, going back to, so we use all of those elements whenever we're making  
**[0:32:09-0:32:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:32:09):**  decisions, you know, we think about that business model and we think is that kind of going in  
**[0:32:13-0:32:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:32:13):**  the right direction.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:32:15):**  But equally, we have been very impacted by and very driven by the idea of writing a context.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:32:23):**  So you know, what you're referring to that Richard Perkins talks about from Alan Savory,  
**[0:32:27-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:32:27):**  writing that kind of holistic context and saying, you know, what do you want your life  
**[0:32:30-0:32:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:32:30):**  to look like?  
**[0:32:32-0:32:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:32:32):**  And how can you deliver that?  
**[0:32:34-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:32:34):**  And I think at the end of the day, because we are so driven by, you know, good food by  
**[0:32:39-0:32:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:32:39):**  providing our own fuel for our home, we're driven by, you know, building really positive  
**[0:32:45-0:32:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:32:45):**  social relations, we're driven by having enough money to pay the bills every month.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:32:50):**  It's a real kind of collective vision.

**[0:33:01-0:33:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:33:01):**  Amazing, that offers some great clarity and also a fantastic example for others who may

**[0:33:16-0:33:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:33:16):**  of developing a farm, especially if like in your situation, you don't have previous experience

**[0:33:52-0:33:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:33:52):**  So one of the things that we do is in Scotland, the Scottish government have this sort of  
**[0:33:59-0:34:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:33:59):**  what they call a farm advisory service and new entrants in Scotland can apply to have  
**[0:34:04-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:34:04):**  a mentor under this kind of funded scheme.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:34:07):**  So we are mentors for some new entrants.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:34:10):**  And we went to see a couple a few weeks ago and they were just kind of setting up on there.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:34:15):**  It was just kind of quite a small farm and we spent, I mean, it was a great day, but  
**[0:34:20-0:34:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:34:20):**  we walked around and one half of the couple was particularly kind of energetic and was

**[0:34:31-0:34:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:34:31):**  And I remember kind of getting home and I just thought, my head is fried.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:34:35):**  You know, there was so much going on.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:34:38):**  I've been since I'm still unpicking it all.

**[0:34:44-0:34:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:34:44):**  You know, it's like a mind map, crazy mind map, and then you whittle it down, you whittle  
**[0:34:48-0:34:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:34:48):**  it down, whittle it down.

**[0:35:15-0:35:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:35:15):**  with their projects and other people who get really excited, put a bunch of energy and

**[0:36:13-0:36:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:36:13):**  What were some of the key resources, learnings or support that you received that turned this  
**[0:36:19-0:36:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:36:19):**  ecological knowledge into a business that could start to support what you're doing?  
**[0:36:25-0:36:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:36:25):**  So we start to, so we get here in March 2016, and we start to try and figure out what we're  
**[0:36:34-0:36:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:36:34):**  going to do and where we're going to go.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:36:36):**  Quite early on, we figure out that mainstream ag is not going to be the route that we're  
**[0:36:41-0:36:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:36:41):**  going to go down.  
**[0:36:42-0:36:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:36:42):**  It's just something not right about it.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:36:45):**  And also, it's not going to work on our land, because our land is not this, you know, kind  
**[0:36:50-0:36:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:36:50):**  of classic kind of farm setup.  
**[0:36:53-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:36:53):**  It's rough.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:36:54):**  It's rugged.

**[0:36:58-0:37:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:36:58):**  So we start to, you know, get on the internet, we start to Google, and we start to have a  
**[0:37:02-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:37:02):**  look and see if there's anybody in Scotland doing anything interesting.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:37:07):**  We start to, at that stage, hear the word regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:37:12):**  By this, and certainly in the UK, at this point, it's not a big thing at all, okay?  
**[0:37:19-0:37:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:37:19):**  And around that time as well, we start to learn about allen savory and the holistic  
**[0:37:24-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:37:24):**  management aspect.  
**[0:37:25-0:37:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:37:25):**  So we find one farm in Scotland that's practicing this over on the west coast.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:37:31):**  So we take ourselves over there, meet these people, and we start to see things like holistic  
**[0:37:37-0:37:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:37:37):**  plant grazing in action.

**[0:37:44-0:37:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:37:44):**  that's possible, you know, in our climate, in our country, but there's not a lot of people  
**[0:37:50-0:37:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:37:50):**  doing it.  
**[0:37:51-0:37:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:37:51):**  So we start to guess, I guess, kind of grow from that.  
**[0:37:55-0:38:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:37:55):**  So we start to come across, I think it's fair to say that two of the biggest influencers  
**[0:38:02-0:38:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:38:02):**  in our journey have been Joel Salatin and have been Richard Perkins.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:38:07):**  So Richard, from the point of view, so Sandra used to, you know, love Richard Perkins.  
**[0:38:12-0:38:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:38:12):**  I used to find her every night, like watching the latest Richard Perkins video.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:38:17):**  And she was really inspired by his approach to be really kind of ingenious about what  
**[0:38:25-0:38:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:38:25):**  he does, but being very efficient.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:38:27):**  I think Richard is very, very good at being very, very efficient.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:38:32):**  I was reading Joel Salatin, How to Farm, which I just, I love that book because it's so easy  
**[0:38:38-0:38:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:38:38):**  to read.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:38:39):**  It's so easy to read.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:38:40):**  And Joel's talking about the basics of things like sales and marketing.  
**[0:38:44-0:38:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:38:44):**  And you know, I love how simple he makes it.

**[0:38:53-0:38:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:38:53):**  business side of view, the sales and marketing side of view.

**[0:39:01-0:39:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:39:01):**  And then what we're doing is using our ecological knowledge and our practical skills to weave

**[0:39:49-0:39:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:39:49):**  is starting to build and it's really starting to grow.  
**[0:39:52-0:39:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:39:52):**  And more and more people around the UK are starting to come out of the woodwork and they're  
**[0:39:57-0:40:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:39:57):**  going, well, I kind of do that and I do this.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:40:00):**  And, you know, you start sort of mainstream or non mainstream things start to become mainstream.  
**[0:40:07-0:40:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:40:07):**  I think what's interesting now is that, so our learning kind of balloons at that point,  
**[0:40:12-0:40:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:40:12):**  but also we're now at a point where we're running the farm.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:40:15):**  So we're learning on the job all the time.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:40:18):**  You know, we're learning every day from our cattle.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:40:20):**  We're learning every day from our pigs.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:40:21):**  We're learning from our hens.  
**[0:40:22-0:40:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:40:22):**  We're learning from our bees.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:40:23):**  We're learning from our kitchen garden.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:40:25):**  So we're actually now, we started off doing a lot of theoretical learning.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:40:30):**  Now most of our learning, and I would say still now, is practical based learning, which  
**[0:40:34-0:40:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:40:34):**  is lovely because you're really feeling connected with the team around you.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:40:39):**  I think what's interesting now in terms of the regenerative agriculture swell, which  
**[0:40:43-0:40:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:40:43):**  is, you know, I would say a movement that we definitely feel allegiance to and part  
**[0:40:48-0:40:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:40:48):**  of is what does that term now mean?  
**[0:40:53-0:40:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:40:53):**  Because its use has become so widespread and it's interesting.  
**[0:40:58-0:41:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:40:58):**  Learning in this country is becoming under, I guess, across the world, is becoming under  
**[0:41:02-0:41:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:41:02):**  a lot of criticism because of climate change, because of the condition of our soils.  
**[0:41:10-0:41:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:41:10):**  And it's interesting to see how farmers are shifting to using the word regenerative more.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:41:17):**  What I don't know is how much that practice, practices are actually regenerative.  
**[0:41:25-0:41:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:41:25):**  So I think that's where kind of like the next kind of stage is going to be for learning,  
**[0:41:30-0:41:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:41:30):**  for anybody getting into the regenerative world is what actually is regenerative?  
**[0:41:35-0:41:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:41:35):**  Because it's changed a lot, even since we started out.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:41:38):**  Well, let's unpack what it means then for you.  
**[0:41:42-0:41:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:41:42):**  Where do you see the trajectory of the development of the ecosystem that you steward based on  
**[0:41:47-0:41:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:41:47):**  the information that you have in ecology, but also the impact that you see that you're  
**[0:41:52-0:41:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:41:52):**  capable of making with the enterprises that you manage?  
**[0:41:57-0:42:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:41:57):**  So for us, I think it's really quite simple.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:42:01):**  For us, the regenerative element, I guess, is two part.  
**[0:42:05-0:42:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:42:05):**  So it's land part and it's people part.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:42:11):**  So the land element, it's pretty easy to review, to assess, to understand if your practices  
**[0:42:19-0:42:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:42:19):**  are being regenerative.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:42:20):**  And again, I would say it's things like, for us, it's things like how many worms are in  
**[0:42:25-0:42:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:42:25):**  the soil?  
**[0:42:26-0:42:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:42:26):**  Because generally, if you've got a lot of worms in the soil, your soil is kind of healthy.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:42:31):**  Are your cowpats full of insects?  
**[0:42:32-0:42:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:42:32):**  Are you seeing lots of birds in your ecosystem?  
**[0:42:35-0:42:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:42:35):**  Are you able to count more than 10 types of grasses in your pasture?  
**[0:42:40-0:42:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:42:40):**  All these kinds of things you can start to see if your impact is regenerative, because  
**[0:42:44-0:42:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:42:44):**  you're wanting to see that kind of diversity blossom and bloom every year.  
**[0:42:51-0:42:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:42:51):**  I think for us, what we also really focus on is the impact of regenerative agriculture  
**[0:42:56-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:42:56):**  having a regenerative impact on societies.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:43:01):**  Particularly for us, it's our local community.  
**[0:43:03-0:43:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:43:03):**  So that is why we went down the route of only selling our produce locally.  
**[0:43:07-0:43:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:43:07):**  So we don't ship, we don't post.  
**[0:43:10-0:43:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:43:10):**  And that's mainly because our kind of core belief is that our food is there to nourish  
**[0:43:16-0:43:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:43:16):**  and regenerate our community.  
**[0:43:18-0:43:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:43:18):**  It's also a place, Limbreck is also a place where we invite people to, local, national,  
**[0:43:24-0:43:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:43:24):**  international, whoever, to come and learn about food production and feel how they can  
**[0:43:30-0:43:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:43:30):**  play a direct part in regenerating the world through the very food that they buy.  
**[0:43:37-0:43:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:43:37):**  Local thing like, don't choose barn eggs, choose organic eggs or choose, it's having  
**[0:43:43-0:43:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:43:43):**  these kinds of conversations.  
**[0:43:45-0:43:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:43:45):**  I think what I've kind of started to really think about is where does the change in farming  
**[0:43:51-0:43:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:43:51):**  start?  
**[0:43:52-0:43:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:43:52):**  Where does the shift to regenerative agriculture start?  
**[0:43:54-0:44:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:43:54):**  Does it start at one end with the farmer or does it actually start at the other end with  
**[0:44:00-0:44:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:44:00):**  the people that buy the produce?  
**[0:44:02-0:44:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:44:02):**  And I still can't kind of get that clear in my head.  
**[0:44:05-0:44:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:44:05):**  Sometimes I think maybe it starts with the people that buy the produce because at the  
**[0:44:09-0:44:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:44:09):**  end of the day, we are a business that provides a product and the product that we provide,  
**[0:44:16-0:44:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:44:16):**  if it's popular, people will buy it.  
**[0:44:18-0:44:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:44:18):**  So if we want to create something that lots of people will buy, we need to kind of educate  
**[0:44:24-0:44:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:44:24):**  them that the best food comes from the happiest animals that have the best life on the best  
**[0:44:30-0:44:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:44:30):**  soils in the best climate building diversity.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:44:34):**  So actually, do we need to work more on the customers to drive the change towards regenerative  
**[0:44:39-0:44:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:44:39):**  agriculture?  
**[0:44:41-0:44:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:44:41):**  Or do we still need to focus on the farmers to get them to change?  
**[0:44:46-0:44:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:44:46):**  In the middle, and this is where the block is, right?  
**[0:44:48-0:44:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:44:48):**  This is where the big block is, is you've got supermarkets and big ag.  
**[0:44:54-0:44:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:44:54):**  And that is where I think it's fair to say, you've got the sandwich, right?  
**[0:44:58-0:45:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:44:58):**  You've got the bread at either side and then you've got the whatever you want to describe  
**[0:45:02-0:45:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:45:02):**  it in the middle.

**[0:45:20-0:45:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:45:20):**  prices and giving you a penny a time.

**[0:45:30-0:45:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:45:30):**  And the only way that I see that we can do it, and this is where I always talk about  
**[0:45:33-0:45:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:45:33):**  us, we just do our thing with the community that we have in the location that we are.  
**[0:45:40-0:45:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:45:40):**  We bypass both of those blocks and we create that direct connection.

**[0:45:48-0:45:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:45:48):**  And that way we believe that our impact is truly regenerative because we're doing the

**[0:45:59-0:46:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:45:59):**  This is something that I think about a lot and I've been exploring on the show for a  
**[0:46:01-0:46:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:46:01):**  long time.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:46:02):**  I really agree with that answer.  
**[0:46:05-0:46:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:46:05):**  I'm also curious what some of the decisions that you took early on that have been some  
**[0:46:09-0:46:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:46:09):**  of the most effective or most valuable for both your business and your quality of life,  
**[0:46:14-0:46:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:46:14):**  but also for this trajectory towards the regeneration that you just described.  
**[0:46:19-0:46:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:46:19):**  That's a big question.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:46:23):**  So I think early on, we always, in terms of the business side, it was always about selling  
**[0:46:31-0:46:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:46:31):**  though, it was always about selling direct selling.  
**[0:46:33-0:46:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:46:33):**  And I think that has been, and we've never diverged from that.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:46:36):**  We've had so many people say, I'll stock your produce in my shop.  
**[0:46:39-0:46:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:46:39):**  I'd like to do this, that and the other.  
**[0:46:42-0:46:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:46:42):**  We've always said, no, we're kind of keeping that direct selling.  
**[0:46:45-0:46:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:46:45):**  And we can do that because we've stayed at the size that we're at.  
**[0:46:49-0:46:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:46:49):**  It's just me and Sandra.

**[0:47:02-0:47:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:47:02):**  coming and going all the time, it's still our home.

**[0:47:07-0:47:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:47:07):**  And we're very protective of our space and our personal kind of lives and our personal

**[0:47:19-0:47:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:47:19):**  super, super, super effective.  
**[0:47:22-0:47:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:47:22):**  I think as well, one thing that we've really, and I'm not saying that we get this right  
**[0:47:26-0:47:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:47:26):**  every time because I don't think we do, is we've really stayed true to putting ourselves  
**[0:47:34-0:47:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:47:34):**  first.  
**[0:47:36-0:47:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:47:36):**  And the reason why I say sometimes I don't think we do that very well is that sometimes  
**[0:47:41-0:47:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:47:41):**  this opportunity will come along and you think, oh, we've got to try that.  
**[0:47:44-0:47:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:47:44):**  We've got to kind of take that opportunity.  
**[0:47:46-0:47:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:47:46):**  And then you realise that it's just not quite right.  
**[0:47:49-0:47:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:47:49):**  And that, I guess, is the challenge of running a really diverse business is that you have  
**[0:47:54-0:48:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:47:54):**  this tendency to spread yourself so thin and you're in danger of running into a situation  
**[0:48:01-0:48:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:48:01):**  where you do lots of things really, really badly.  
**[0:48:04-0:48:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:48:04):**  And we've certainly been in that situation or nearly been in that situation before.  
**[0:48:09-0:48:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:48:09):**  So I think, but we've reset, we've always reset.  
**[0:48:13-0:48:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:48:13):**  So we've always reset and we've always kind of been able to pull it back and go, no, right,  
**[0:48:17-0:48:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:48:17):**  what is it we're trying to do here?  
**[0:48:20-0:48:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:48:20):**  We're still passionate about growing our own food.  
**[0:48:22-0:48:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:48:22):**  How do we build that back?  
**[0:48:24-0:48:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:48:24):**  But hey, what are the bills doing this month?  
**[0:48:26-0:48:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:48:26):**  What kind of money do we need to be making?  
**[0:48:28-0:48:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:48:28):**  And we really try and kind of balance it all out.  
**[0:48:32-0:48:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:48:32):**  I think another thing that we've always said that we would do, and I got this from Joel  
**[0:48:38-0:48:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:48:38):**  Salatin but also from Richard Perkins, is that we've always maintained our independence.  
**[0:48:44-0:48:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:48:44):**  Now for us, that's been a really strong thing.  
**[0:48:48-0:48:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:48:48):**  So we have a name.  
**[0:48:50-0:48:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:48:50):**  We have a logo.  
**[0:48:52-0:48:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:48:52):**  People know who we are.  
**[0:48:54-0:49:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:48:54):**  People identify how we farm with our name and the little kind of visual that we have.  
**[0:49:03-0:49:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:49:03):**  We're not certified by anybody.  
**[0:49:04-0:49:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:49:04):**  Okay, so we're not organic.  
**[0:49:06-0:49:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:49:06):**  We're not pasture fed.  
**[0:49:07-0:49:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:49:07):**  We're not Scotch beef.  
**[0:49:09-0:49:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:49:09):**  We're not any kind of certification.  
**[0:49:12-0:49:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:49:12):**  And that is because we've always wanted to maintain flexibility and an independence ourselves.  
**[0:49:19-0:49:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:49:19):**  Sometimes that makes you feel like you're an island.  
**[0:49:22-0:49:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:49:22):**  And that could be quite an unnerving, intimidating experience.  
**[0:49:27-0:49:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:49:27):**  So we try to kind of tread that line very, very carefully of maintaining our independence  
**[0:49:34-0:49:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:49:34):**  but not being un-collaborative, if that's even a word.  
**[0:49:41-0:49:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:49:41):**  But I think that's been really, really important.  
**[0:49:42-0:49:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:49:42):**  So that means we just keep our freedom to do what it is that we want to do.  
**[0:49:46-0:49:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:49:46):**  And that actually leads right into the flip side of that question, which is what are some  
**[0:49:50-0:49:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:49:50):**  of the things that you wish you knew from the beginning that would have helped you avoid  
**[0:49:55-0:49:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:49:55):**  some of the mistakes that I'm sure came up in the process?  
**[0:49:58-0:50:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:49:58):**  How dare you?  
**[0:50:00-0:50:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:50:00):**  We made mistakes?  
**[0:50:01-0:50:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:50:01):**  What?  
**[0:50:02-0:50:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:50:02):**  I saw the book.  
**[0:50:04-0:50:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:50:04):**  Yeah, I know.  
**[0:50:06-0:50:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:50:06):**  We still make mistakes.  
**[0:50:07-0:50:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:50:07):**  We make mistakes all the time.

**[0:50:16-0:50:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:50:16):**  And I would say that honestly, I don't think there's anything that we wish we would have  
**[0:50:22-0:50:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:50:22):**  known, or we wish we would have done differently, because that would have impeded in the learning  
**[0:50:27-0:50:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:50:27):**  that we've had.  
**[0:50:28-0:50:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:50:28):**  And it would not have brought us to the point at which we're at.  
**[0:50:33-0:50:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:50:33):**  I think one of the things that I maybe would have liked to have known more, but probably  
**[0:50:37-0:50:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:50:37):**  wouldn't have changed anything was that we're never going to have a holiday, or we certainly  
**[0:50:40-0:50:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:50:40):**  have managed it for the last six years.  
**[0:50:42-0:50:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:50:42):**  We're getting there.  
**[0:50:43-0:50:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:50:43):**  We're working on it.  
**[0:50:44-0:50:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:50:44):**  But I think had we have known very honestly how difficult this would have been, I think

**[0:51:38-0:51:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:51:38):**  to who you are, but be very sensible about it at the same time.

**[0:51:50-0:51:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:51:50):**  is they say, well, how am I going to pay for this?

**[0:51:56-0:51:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:51:56):**  It's not what you want to do.

**[0:52:20-0:52:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:52:20):**  rather than what other people have done, and it's worked for them, and that's great, is

**[0:52:29-0:52:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:52:29):**  to start up and I'm going to set up, because I know I've got this money for a year.

**[0:52:40-0:52:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:52:40):**  when you leave, or you go, or you reduce, or you increase, or whatever.

**[0:53:32-0:53:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:53:32):**  I know that's a big focus for you, and clearly you've made some limiting decisions in your

**[0:55:06-0:55:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:55:06):**  What we then realized was that we've made these connections with the farming community,

**[0:55:27-0:55:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:55:27):**  from a business side and you think, well, I need to start to get to know these people  
**[0:55:30-0:55:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:55:30):**  because I'm going to have produce to sell and I need a marketplace, blah, blah, blah.

**[0:59:34-0:59:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:59:34):**  I think can be applied to any type of community connections or dynamics.

**[0:59:44-0:59:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:59:44):**  into farming for the first time?  
**[0:59:47-0:59:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:59:47):**  It's a really great question.  
**[0:59:50-0:59:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:59:50):**  So I try to think back of where we were whenever we were starting out.  
**[0:59:57-1:00:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=0:59:57):**  And it's something that I've reflected on a lot as we've been talking today.  
**[1:00:00-1:00:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:00:00):**  And that is first of all being very true and honest about how it is that you want your  
**[1:00:05-1:00:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:00:05):**  life to look.  
**[1:00:07-1:00:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:00:07):**  Why are you going into farming?  
**[1:00:08-1:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:00:08):**  Is it, in our case, it was about a passion for growing food and a love of nature.  
**[1:00:13-1:00:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:00:13):**  Those have stayed right at the very core of what we're doing.  
**[1:00:17-1:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:00:17):**  So I think you have to be super, super clear about your core vision and then how it is  
**[1:00:22-1:00:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:00:22):**  that you want your life to look.  
**[1:00:24-1:00:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:00:24):**  So do you want to go into farming whereby your main focus is on financial return and  
**[1:00:34-1:00:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:00:34):**  you're not really too worried about how you're going to get there, but you want to be kind  
**[1:00:38-1:00:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:00:38):**  to nature along the way.  
**[1:00:39-1:00:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:00:39):**  Then that's the kind of route that you need to really look into and learn about.  
**[1:00:44-1:00:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:00:44):**  So read people that do it, go and visit farmers that do it, that do the kind of farming that  
**[1:00:49-1:00:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:00:49):**  you want to do.  
**[1:00:51-1:00:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:00:51):**  And that's the best route to go down in that.  
**[1:00:56-1:01:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:00:56):**  I think on reflection, we asked a lot of people for advice.  
**[1:01:03-1:01:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:01:03):**  We took very little of it because we ended up figuring our own path out.  
**[1:01:08-1:01:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:01:08):**  But never discredit that advice because that advice is still learning for you to say, no,  
**[1:01:15-1:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:01:15):**  I have learned that and I now reject that or that's not right for me.  
**[1:01:20-1:01:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:01:20):**  It's still learning.  
**[1:01:21-1:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:01:21):**  It's still really, really important to, it's almost even as important to learn all the  
**[1:01:25-1:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:01:25):**  stuff that you don't want to do as it is to help you figure out what it is that you do  
**[1:01:29-1:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:01:29):**  want to do.  
**[1:01:31-1:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:01:31):**  I think the other thing that I would say is that the biggest block to getting into farming  
**[1:01:39-1:01:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:01:39):**  is access to land.  
**[1:01:43-1:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:01:43):**  We get asked all the time, how do I get access to land?  
**[1:01:46-1:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:01:46):**  And you know what my answer now is?  
**[1:01:48-1:01:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:01:48):**  I don't know what the solution is.  
**[1:01:50-1:01:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:01:50):**  I know what the problems are, but I don't know what the solution is.  
**[1:01:53-1:01:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:01:53):**  But what I would say to anybody is you just have to keep on plugging.  
**[1:01:59-1:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:01:59):**  We were in a similar situation.  
**[1:02:02-1:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:02:02):**  We just had to keep on trying.  
**[1:02:04-1:02:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:02:04):**  I've always been a firm believer of open as many doors as you can because you're the one  
**[1:02:08-1:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:02:08):**  that closes them.  
**[1:02:09-1:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:02:09):**  If you haven't opened the doors, you don't know which ones you can close and which ones  
**[1:02:12-1:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:02:12):**  you want to keep open.  
**[1:02:14-1:02:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:02:14):**  So the idea is keep, just do not take no for an answer.  
**[1:02:17-1:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:02:17):**  Keep looking, look on the market, look for tenancies, approach people with land.  
**[1:02:22-1:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:02:22):**  You just have to keep trying because this is not an easy field to get into if you're  
**[1:02:27-1:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:02:27):**  not born into it or a family in it or whatever.  
**[1:02:30-1:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:02:30):**  But that doesn't mean that it's not possible.  
**[1:02:32-1:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:02:32):**  And I think there's a growing movement.  
**[1:02:34-1:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:02:34):**  Last year, for example, we run one of our courses.  
**[1:02:37-1:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:02:37):**  And we had a guy on it who had run a company that had a turnover of 100 million a year.  
**[1:02:43-1:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:02:43):**  He's retired.  
**[1:02:44-1:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:02:44):**  He's now buying up land in parts of England.  
**[1:02:47-1:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:02:47):**  And his vision is to eventually separate that land up into small scale farms.  
**[1:02:55-1:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:02:55):**  So there are people starting to get an awareness of what's happening.  
**[1:03:01-1:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:03:01):**  And there are people on the other side who have got money who are starting to look at  
**[1:03:05-1:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:03:05):**  their land holdings and think, what can I do for the world?  
**[1:03:08-1:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:03:08):**  What can I do for the community?  
**[1:03:10-1:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:03:10):**  So you just never know what opportunity will come your way.  
**[1:03:13-1:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:03:13):**  But never, ever, ever stop believing and stop trying.  
**[1:03:16-1:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:03:16):**  Just simply don't do it.  
**[1:03:18-1:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:03:18):**  Oh, that's such an inspiring message.  
**[1:03:20-1:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:03:20):**  I love that you said that.

**[1:03:26-1:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/lynn-cassels-on-their-journey-to-starting-a-successful-farm-with-no-prior-experience/#t=1:03:26):**  of how to get access to land now.

**[0:00:00-0:00:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:03-0:00:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:00:03):**  Here we dive deep into the worlds of permaculture, natural building, and regenerative living  
**[0:00:07-0:00:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:00:07):**  as we aspire to help you reach your highest potential for yourself, for your community,  
**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:00:12):**  and for this beautiful planet that we all share.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:00:14):**  As always, I'm your host Oliver Gaucher, and I have a great session for you in this week's  
**[0:00:18-0:00:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:00:18):**  episode, so let's jump right in!  
**[0:00:30-0:00:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:00:30):**  Are you looking for the best resources to help you build a regenerative lifestyle?  
**[0:00:34-0:00:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:00:34):**  New Society Publishers has been a leader in sustainable publishing for over 30 years.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:00:39):**  They publish good news and solutions for individuals and organizations seeking to change their  
**[0:00:43-0:00:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:00:43):**  lives so that they may change the world for the better.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:00:46):**  Their company mandate goes far beyond the single bottom line of profit.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:00:50):**  They care deeply not only about what they publish, but also how they do business.  
**[0:00:55-0:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:00:55):**  They believe in the authors that they take on and the works that they bring to the marketplace.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:00:59):**  From sustainable living to progressive parenting, New Society Publishers has the books you need  
**[0:01:04-0:01:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:01:04):**  to help build a better world.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:01:06):**  Buy your print and ebooks online at www.newsociety.com or at fine bookstores near you.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:01:14):**  Alright, hello and welcome everybody to this very special episode of the Regenerative Roundtable.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:01:22):**  We don't have all of our normal speakers.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:01:25):**  Neil is still here, we can't get rid of him, but Jeremy's gone back to the States.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:01:29):**  He's driving the bus back up and he's got some work to do up there.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:01:32):**  So instead, we are joined by two of our good friends who were recently interviewed on the  
**[0:01:37-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:01:37):**  podcast actually two weeks ago for their business La Boteica Verde.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:01:42):**  Michelle and Juliana, would you like to say hi?  
**[0:01:44-0:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:01:44):**  Hello, hello, we're happy to be back.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:01:46):**  Hi, thanks for having us.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:01:48):**  Alright, so let's get into it.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:01:50):**  I know we've all been working on some really fun projects lately.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:01:54):**  Neil, I'm going to hit you up first.  
**[0:01:55-0:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:01:55):**  Why don't you tell us a little bit about what's been going on at our Homestead model and then  
**[0:02:00-0:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:02:00):**  we'll pass it around and talk a little bit about what's coming up as well.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:02:04):**  Cool.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:02:05):**  Hi everybody.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:02:07):**  It's great to be here with Michelle and Julie.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:02:10):**  It's such a huge improvement from the normal company we keep with Jeremy.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:02:14):**  Sorry, Jeremy.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:02:16):**  But objectively speaking, this is just a better looking realm table.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:02:22):**  So yeah, what are we doing?  
**[0:02:23-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:02:23):**  Well, we're trying to get our house finished.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:02:25):**  We're sort of nearly there.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:02:28):**  Or at least we're nearly ready to move into it.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:02:30):**  But we've got a lot of volunteers this week.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:02:32):**  So this this last week on BITE, which is great.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:02:36):**  And we've been working a lot on our sort of composting animal system.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:02:40):**  So putting in a nice chicken run in the center of the property below the goat house.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:02:46):**  And kind of really thinking about a sort of cheap and nice looking way of doing it so  
**[0:02:51-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:02:51):**  that we can have happy chickens and be able to send them to different areas of the farm  
**[0:02:55-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:02:55):**  and just to have, I kind of see it like setting up the stomach of the farm.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:03:00):**  That's what, you know, I kind of look at a farm or anything that I'm designing, kind  
**[0:03:04-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:03:04):**  of like the way a body works, it has all these individual pieces to it.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:03:08):**  But sort of where the animals reside is that's where all of your your material just gets  
**[0:03:13-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:03:13):**  broken down and recycled and then worked back into the land.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:03:17):**  So it's pretty fun at the moment, we're putting it right below the goat house so that we can  
**[0:03:21-0:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:03:21):**  empty the goat manure down into the chicken house.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:03:24):**  And then we've got like a several tiered terrace system so that it will eventually come out  
**[0:03:29-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:03:29):**  of there as like really nice Bokashi.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:03:32):**  And then also have happy animals, good products.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:03:37):**  So that's what we've been working on a lot and that's a lot of fun.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:03:41):**  What have we got coming up in the next month before we check back in?  
**[0:03:46-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:03:46):**  In the next month before we check back in?  
**[0:03:49-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:03:49):**  Well apart from finishing that, I'm really hoping that when we check back in I'll be  
**[0:03:54-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:03:54):**  in our house.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:03:56):**  So that's like taking up a huge amount of time.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:04:00):**  Of course, we've got a course coming up in a couple of weeks, an introduction to permaculture  
**[0:04:03-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:04:03):**  course.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:04:05):**  And the big thing I want to get done in the next couple of weeks is get a lot of trees  
**[0:04:12-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:04:12):**  planted, a lot of trees in our nursery, we're just starting to ramp up.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:04:17):**  And I guess the thing to bear in mind about, you know, reforestation and all this is that  
**[0:04:23-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:04:23):**  planting vegetables is one thing but planting trees, you got to start like a year ahead  
**[0:04:28-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:04:28):**  of when you want to plant them.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:04:29):**  And we want to be planting most of our fruit trees when we come around to this time next  
**[0:04:33-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:04:33):**  year because we got a lot of earthworks to do on the rest of our property and the places  
**[0:04:37-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:04:37):**  we want to put in our food forests and our agroforestry systems and we can't just go  
**[0:04:42-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:04:42):**  and move a load of earth before heavy rains.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:04:46):**  So what we're going to do is start tons and tons of seeds, get them to the size where  
**[0:04:51-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:04:51):**  we can graft if we decide to graft.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:04:53):**  So we'll do a mixture of grafted fruit trees and fruit trees propagated from seed and have  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:04:57):**  a big amount of stuff ready to go into the ground in 12 months time when the next sets  
**[0:05:02-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:05:02):**  of rains are coming.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:05:04):**  So that's going to be a big project.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:05:06):**  I feel very passionate about it because there's just where we live in Sununna, there's just  
**[0:05:11-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:05:11):**  everywhere in Guatemala really, there's just all these amazing varieties of fruits and  
**[0:05:16-0:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:05:16):**  niche things that you don't really find anywhere.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:05:19):**  So for me it's really cool to be like getting to work on propagating those and that's what  
**[0:05:25-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:05:25):**  I love to see like every area having its own nursery and seed bank of things that just  
**[0:05:29-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:05:29):**  really do well in that area.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:05:33):**  Yeah absolutely there's a lot of fun things coming up.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:05:37):**  Julie and Michelle could you for people who didn't catch the last episode where we interviewed  
**[0:05:42-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:05:42):**  you about your business could you fill them in a little bit about what you do and talk  
**[0:05:46-0:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:05:46):**  a little bit about some of the projects that you're working on at the moment and what's  
**[0:05:50-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:05:50):**  coming up in this rainy season and how that sort of affects the supply flow of some of  
**[0:05:56-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:05:56):**  the foods that you guys distribute.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:06:00):**  La Oltica Verde is this really exciting project that helps small farmers find better markets  
**[0:06:07-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:06:07):**  and access to new selling points through us in the capital in Guatemala City and Antigua  
**[0:06:15-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:06:15):**  and San Marcos.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:06:18):**  And well this rainy season is going to be really exciting because we've been working  
**[0:06:23-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:06:23):**  a lot with the producers on planning the rotational systems and also to project how much it is  
**[0:06:33-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:06:33):**  that we're going to be buying in these next few months.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:06:37):**  We've been working on this for at least three to four months which means that everything  
**[0:06:41-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:06:41):**  is going to be going into production right now and we're getting a lot of new products  
**[0:06:46-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:06:46):**  like malanga is new, we're gonna get passion fruit, we're going sweet corn, string beans,  
**[0:06:55-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:06:55):**  there's so many things that are coming, it's super exciting.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:06:58):**  You mean all stuff that does well here in the rainy season right?  
**[0:07:03-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:07:03):**  We're gonna actually keep producing everything that we commonly produce throughout the rainy  
**[0:07:08-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:07:08):**  season and the methods that I'm trying to experiment with so that we don't have a lot  
**[0:07:13-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:07:13):**  of problems with fungi is obviously mulching with straw so that the soil doesn't bounce  
**[0:07:23-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:07:23):**  back up into the leaves and damage the leaves.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:07:29):**  Just for people who don't know it's an interesting one here right because we have a 12 month  
**[0:07:33-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:07:33):**  growing season but two very distinct because you've six months of heavy heavy rains and  
**[0:07:39-0:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:07:39):**  six months of drought basically and conversely the six months of drought if you have irrigation  
**[0:07:46-0:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:07:46):**  is much easier to produce kind of like what we call vegetables, salads, things I guess  
**[0:07:53-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:07:53):**  people are used to seeing in their basket of organic products right?  
**[0:07:58-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:07:58):**  So is it a little bit difficult to manage client expectations as the seasons change?  
**[0:08:05-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:08:05):**  It has been absolutely, definitely has been a challenge because in the dry season things  
**[0:08:10-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:08:10):**  tend to get a little bit smaller and the wilting is accelerated because things have less moisture  
**[0:08:18-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:08:18):**  in them when you cut them.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:08:21):**  Alternatively in the rainy season we have more fungi problems and there is definitely  
**[0:08:29-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:08:29):**  variability but luckily the farmers that we're working with are brilliant and they're definitely  
**[0:08:34-0:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:08:34):**  creative and find solutions to these problems and we're there to help them along the way  
**[0:08:39-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:08:39):**  as well.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:08:40):**  Yeah and I imagine that's a big part of where your sort of expertise and skill set comes  
**[0:08:44-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:08:44):**  in in like in being able to provide technical assistance to your producers right?  
**[0:08:50-0:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:08:50):**  Yeah definitely both Michelle and I have done a few workshops with them.  
**[0:08:55-0:09:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:08:55):**  The one that Michelle did on how to harvest in a hygienic way actually was instrumental  
**[0:09:02-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:09:02):**  to becoming a more consistent high quality product.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:09:08):**  Yeah Michelle that's fantastic.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:09:10):**  Can you explain a little bit more about how that workshop went and some of the results  
**[0:09:16-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:09:16):**  that you've seen from it since?  
**[0:09:19-0:09:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:09:19):**  Sure.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:09:23):**  So what we focused on was a post-harvest workshop and we taught producers how to harvest things  
**[0:09:31-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:09:31):**  hygienically so like using things like tools, having clean fingernails, things like that  
**[0:09:37-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:09:37):**  that can actually damage the product after it's been harvested and it leads to loss.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:09:44):**  So yeah those are some of the things.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:09:50):**  We also covered how to use instead of baskets because people use like woven baskets here  
**[0:09:56-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:09:56):**  and that can damage the product very quickly because it has a lot of sharp edges so using  
**[0:10:01-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:10:01):**  smooth boxes or como seisang huacales.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:10:09):**  Yeah plastic tubs that have smooth surfaces and then people can use that to transport  
**[0:10:15-0:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:10:15):**  the goods and also how to arrange the goods inside the boxes or these smooth containers  
**[0:10:22-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:10:22):**  is super important in reducing post-harvest loss.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:10:25):**  Alright so Julie why don't you tell me about some of the projects that you have coming  
**[0:10:29-0:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:10:29):**  up.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:10:30):**  So with the period of different things that you're exploring with the business go ahead  
**[0:10:36-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:10:36):**  and explain some of the exciting things that are coming in the upcoming months.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:10:42):**  One of the things we're most excited about right now is that we finally moved into our  
**[0:10:46-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:10:46):**  new warehouse and we're developing the warehouse to be as functional as possible so that the  
**[0:10:52-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:10:52):**  flow is really efficient and there's one area where we're creating a wash station that's  
**[0:10:59-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:10:59):**  going to have you know the surface where we receive the vegetables and then the stainless  
**[0:11:05-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:11:05):**  steel tubs and then a drying rack with fans that I researched on YouTube and actually  
**[0:11:12-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:11:12):**  works super well apparently.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:11:13):**  Oh like a dry like for drying the salads and all that stuff by using airflow.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:11:17):**  Yeah have you tried that before?  
**[0:11:19-0:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:11:19):**  No but it's a great idea.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:11:21):**  I really like I'm just too sorry to cut you off but I think it's so cool the way you mentioned  
**[0:11:24-0:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:11:24):**  like designing even the warehouse with energetic flows in mind like that's such an important  
**[0:11:30-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:11:30):**  thing to get that like these sort of permaculture or holistic design techniques you can apply  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:11:35):**  them to every area of your business and your life right and that's I feel like such a great  
**[0:11:40-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:11:40):**  asset but they cover they have having you working there.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:11:44):**  Spoken as a true permaculturist there Neil.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:11:48):**  Well actually just going off of that point that you just mentioned one of the really  
**[0:11:52-0:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:11:52):**  cool things about how we design where our products are coming from.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:11:56):**  We see Guatemala as a big one big farm let's say and we see our zone zero as everything  
**[0:12:03-0:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:12:03):**  around where the warehouse is our zone one is a little bit after that our zone two is  
**[0:12:07-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:12:07):**  a little bit further away so even the products that we're sourcing we see it as coming from  
**[0:12:13-0:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:12:13):**  zone zero so one zone two and then the things that are more perishable quickly come from  
**[0:12:18-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:12:18):**  nearby so we apply permaculture principles even to that.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:12:23):**  Yeah that makes a lot of sense I know from my own experience in working in farms like  
**[0:12:28-0:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:12:28):**  that's kind of the linchpin as to whether you can remain profitable viable as a business  
**[0:12:32-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:12:32):**  because you may be able to create a very healthy ecosystem that produces a lot of food but  
**[0:12:37-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:12:37):**  if you can't process that into something that actually makes it to market you're not going  
**[0:12:41-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:12:41):**  to be able to make money off the harvest and so like you talked about finding good flows  
**[0:12:48-0:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:12:48):**  in the energy patterns and making sure that the efficiency is worked into that can definitely  
**[0:12:53-0:12:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:12:53):**  be a complete game changer for producers in being able to get their products at a high  
**[0:12:59-0:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:12:59):**  quality out to people who are going to be consuming them.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:13:05):**  Another really exciting thing that we're working on is that behind the warehouse there's a  
**[0:13:09-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:13:09):**  huge open empty lot and we're merging two big projects that we've had in mind for a  
**[0:13:17-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:13:17):**  long time.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:13:18):**  We have a nursery made out of bamboo that's going up right now, you should come check  
**[0:13:22-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:13:22):**  it out, it's so beautiful.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:13:25):**  It's extraordinary.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:13:26):**  I'll hook you up with Javier the young man who's done them before and is working on ours  
**[0:13:33-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:13:33):**  and in front of that we're gonna have demonstrative, is that a word?  
**[0:13:38-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:13:38):**  Demonstrative plots that have all the different cultivars that we're interested in exploring  
**[0:13:44-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:13:44):**  and different techniques that we've seen along the years that work really well.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:13:49):**  For example, activated carbon mixed with warm compost and violas or fermented oxygenated  
**[0:13:59-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:13:59):**  fertilizers that we make on site and we're also working with this new product called  
**[0:14:05-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:14:05):**  Ceolita, have you heard of that?  
**[0:14:07-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:14:07):**  No, Ceolita.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:14:09):**  It's actually, they ship it in from Cuba and it's what helped the Cubans overcome, well  
**[0:14:17-0:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:14:17):**  one of the techniques that they used to overcome that crisis that they had when they never,  
**[0:14:23-0:14:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:14:23):**  when they didn't have access to synthetic fertilizers anymore.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:14:26):**  Which FYI is a crisis we should all learn how to deal with ourselves because we, that  
**[0:14:32-0:14:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:14:32):**  day may arrive for all of us very soon so learning from the Cubans is a great idea I  
**[0:14:36-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:14:36):**  think.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:14:37):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:14:38):**  And the methods in agriculture are spectacular, I mean creative and insightful and wonderful  
**[0:14:45-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:14:45):**  and this product Ceolita, what it does, it's an aluminosilicate and it captures the fertilizers  
**[0:14:51-0:15:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:14:51):**  at an ionic level between the strata of the aluminum and the silicates and then the roots  
**[0:15:00-0:15:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:15:00):**  are the only way that that fertilizer can come back out so none of it is leached into  
**[0:15:05-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:15:05):**  waterways which is really, really cool.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:15:09):**  That's fantastic because I know that's a huge problem especially in these rainy seasons  
**[0:15:13-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:15:13):**  where all of a sudden you get huge inundations of water you can very quickly lose the fertility  
**[0:15:17-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:15:17):**  of your soil if it's not bound by something either chemically or through proper landscape  
**[0:15:23-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:15:23):**  management so that it doesn't just fall off the site.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:15:27):**  It's so cool, it really seems like your business is like going to the next level especially  
**[0:15:31-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:15:31):**  when you're like talking about having this demonstrative site, getting a nursery going.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:15:38):**  One question I have like on a kind of specific thing about technique is it always occurs  
**[0:15:43-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:15:43):**  to me when I see producers of annual crops here in this zone that very few people use  
**[0:15:52-0:16:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:15:52):**  what we call alley cropping, you know the planting of like leguminous trees, perennials,  
**[0:16:00-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:16:00):**  and contour so that they can like both prevent erosion and also like produce biomass and  
**[0:16:07-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:16:07):**  you know and there's, I do see it being used by permaculture but usually just kind of gringos  
**[0:16:13-0:16:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:16:13):**  who have like a permaculture farm sort of like we do.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:16:16):**  I'm curious is it something that you've like thought about or thought about like introducing  
**[0:16:21-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:16:21):**  to your farmers?  
**[0:16:25-0:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:16:25):**  We haven't talked about introducing them on contours but we have talked a lot about introducing  
**[0:16:34-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:16:34):**  different varieties into the edges because we want to have buffer zones between neighbors  
**[0:16:40-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:16:40):**  and the plots that our producers have to minimize the movement of agrochemicals that we don't  
**[0:16:49-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:16:49):**  want you know.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:16:50):**  I mean it's such a great technique these alley croppings you know you just plant lines of  
**[0:16:55-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:16:55):**  legumes on contour if it's steep land or not if it's not and they do so many things because  
**[0:17:00-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:17:00):**  just like you say they block kind of waste products coming into your land, they produce  
**[0:17:05-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:17:05):**  windbreaks so they stop your soil getting desiccated, they produce mulch to cover your  
**[0:17:11-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:17:11):**  soil during the especially during the rainy season it's like such an I think an appropriate  
**[0:17:16-0:17:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:17:16):**  technique for this for this climate you know but one that I so rarely see being used.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:17:23):**  That's awesome that's a great recommendation thank you so much.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:17:25):**  Are there specific species that you have in mind that you think would do well at like  
**[0:17:28-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:17:28):**  1000 to 2000 meters?  
**[0:17:32-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:17:32):**  Definitely like the most popular one is Inga or Cuschine as they call it here you know  
**[0:17:39-0:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:17:39):**  but I think just about anything Madre Cacao does really well at really anywhere from about  
**[0:17:46-0:17:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:17:46):**  500 meters to 1500 meters and just about everywhere you go there's like fast growing legumes that  
**[0:17:53-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:17:53):**  are really really useful for this kind of technique and I think it could be a real and  
**[0:17:57-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:17:57):**  the great thing about them is they also double up as as forage for animals you know if you  
**[0:18:01-0:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:18:01):**  decide to incorporate animals into your into your system so it's it's definitely a technique  
**[0:18:06-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:18:06):**  that I have a lot of have a lot of mass in that I'd love to see get you know look there's  
**[0:18:12-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:18:12):**  all kinds of things that I think both Ica Verde and Abundant Edge are gonna collaborate  
**[0:18:17-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:18:17):**  on and sort of just like this thing of like bouncing ideas around I'd never heard of what  
**[0:18:23-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:18:23):**  did you call that thing from Q?  
**[0:18:24-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:18:24):**  Zeolita  
**[0:18:25-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:18:25):**  Zeolita I'd never heard of it you know and it's like every time we have one of these  
**[0:18:27-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:18:27):**  conversations just like new ideas and new ways of sort of improving what we're doing  
**[0:18:33-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:18:33):**  kind of come around you know because one things I really think about is like both Abundant  
**[0:18:39-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:18:39):**  Edge and La Boteica Verde they're both businesses right so we both have to have keep our eye  
**[0:18:44-0:18:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:18:44):**  on the ball in terms of business but I think the thing for both of us is we're very passionate  
**[0:18:50-0:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:18:50):**  about permaculture and ecology as a movement right so it's it's all about trying to help  
**[0:18:55-0:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:18:55):**  each other to to improve what we do yeah.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:18:59):**  Neil  
**[0:19:01-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:19:01):**  Yeah I'm really glad you brought that up Neil because that's one of the aspects that you  
**[0:19:05-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:19:05):**  know a lot of ecologically focused businesses still struggle with in fact you know we don't  
**[0:19:09-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:19:09):**  have all the answers but it's one of the things that I love chatting with these two about  
**[0:19:14-0:19:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:19:14):**  especially because they've focused on that appropriately and have used it as a business  
**[0:19:19-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:19:19):**  model that could be replicated in so many places. Now Michelle I know you mostly take  
**[0:19:24-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:19:24):**  care of the commercial and the business side of this operation can you tell me some of  
**[0:19:28-0:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:19:28):**  the things that you've done recently or found success in in order to help reach a larger  
**[0:19:32-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:19:32):**  audience and kind of increase the market especially here in Guatemala where access to organic  
**[0:19:42-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:19:42):**  goods and high quality food is not nearly the movement that it is in say the United  
**[0:19:49-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:19:49):**  States or Europe.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:19:50):**  Michelle  
**[0:19:52-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:19:52):**  Sure I can talk a little bit about also what our focus is with the business so we have  
**[0:19:56-0:20:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:19:56):**  a demand driven approach to the way that we do business and that means that essentially  
**[0:20:01-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:20:01):**  we want to know what the market wants to buy before the producer starts producing it and  
**[0:20:09-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:20:09):**  we do that very intentionally because right now like I mentioned before a lot of pre-harvest  
**[0:20:15-0:20:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:20:15):**  food waste and a big reason of why that happens is because the farmers don't know in advance  
**[0:20:21-0:20:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:20:21):**  what the market's gonna want to buy so by adopting a demand driven approach what we  
**[0:20:25-0:20:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:20:25):**  do is we work with the farmers to say for example on average how much broccoli does  
**[0:20:30-0:20:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:20:30):**  a person buy every week you know and then we can use projections and say okay well right  
**[0:20:36-0:20:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:20:36):**  now you know we're producing we're selling let's say 25 broccolis or to 25 people and  
**[0:20:42-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:20:42):**  by next month we want to get to 30 you know so that's where Julie comes in she works with  
**[0:20:48-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:20:48):**  the farmers helping them to do their planning their monthly planning or trimester planning  
**[0:20:55-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:20:55):**  so that we can reduce the amount of food waste that there is that is generated by having  
**[0:21:02-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:21:02):**  the farmers know in advance how much they will need to produce so that is that is one  
**[0:21:08-0:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:21:08):**  key element of our business that I think has helped us be really successful both on the  
**[0:21:14-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:21:14):**  with the clients and with the producers because you know less food waste also means less money  
**[0:21:20-0:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:21:20):**  wasted for the farmers less time wasted so it is the most efficient way to do agriculture  
**[0:21:26-0:21:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:21:26):**  is by knowing in advance what's gonna get bought.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:21:29):**  I think that's a remarkable approach I've talked with a lot of small producers and permaculture  
**[0:21:34-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:21:34):**  farms from all over the world and I know that's one of the challenges that they have is they  
**[0:21:39-0:21:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:21:39):**  have to do that sort of research among their clientele themselves and not everyone's equipped  
**[0:21:44-0:21:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:21:44):**  to do it not everyone has time to kind of take those metrics and make the predictions  
**[0:21:50-0:21:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:21:50):**  for the future to cut down on the food waste that would come from not having a market to  
**[0:21:56-0:22:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:21:56):**  buy their perishable stock but I think it's fantastic this business model of being able  
**[0:22:02-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:22:02):**  to create those metrics for your producers so that they don't have to have that as an  
**[0:22:07-0:22:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:22:07):**  aspect of their business and can focus on their production models and the health of  
**[0:22:10-0:22:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:22:10):**  their ecosystems and I can only imagine that as you do business for longer those metrics  
**[0:22:16-0:22:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:22:16):**  will improve and you'll be able to make more accurate predictions within the seasons.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:22:21):**  Now Neil I know we do kind of a similar thing especially because where we live although  
**[0:22:25-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:22:25):**  we're not large producers by any means it's not really the point of what we're trying  
**[0:22:29-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:22:29):**  to show we do have a fluctuation between the tourist seasons when a lot of people are coming  
**[0:22:34-0:22:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:22:34):**  and buying our goat dairy products the products from our market garden and such we need to  
**[0:22:40-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:22:40):**  be able to meet the demand for things that we know that they're going to be buying.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:22:46):**  On the flip side of that as we talked about actually in the last regenerative roundtable  
**[0:22:50-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:22:50):**  we're going now into the low season for tourism and when all the rain comes so we needed to  
**[0:22:55-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:22:55):**  plant appropriately and most of the crops that we have currently in the market garden  
**[0:23:01-0:23:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:23:01):**  are for our own consumption and mature a lot slower however don't face the risks as many  
**[0:23:07-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:23:07):**  like salads and annuals do from the heavy rains.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:23:11):**  Would you like to talk a little bit about how we've planned for that and maybe some  
**[0:23:15-0:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:23:15):**  of the parallels if someone were running a higher production business some of the things  
**[0:23:19-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:23:19):**  that they could think about in order to anticipate the fluctuations in the market?  
**[0:23:25-0:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:23:25):**  Yeah I mean it's all this thing about design from patterns to details right the most overriding  
**[0:23:31-0:23:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:23:31):**  pattern that you're presented with here in Guatemala is the two seasons you know it's  
**[0:23:36-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:23:36):**  actually four but kind of practically speaking it's two it's that heavy rains for six months  
**[0:23:43-0:23:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:23:43):**  and then a drought for six months and the drought for us is also busy season it's a  
**[0:23:48-0:23:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:23:48):**  super nice time for people to visit Guatemala there's less bugs clear night skies and it's  
**[0:23:54-0:23:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:23:54):**  winter in Europe and the States so and where we live is such a beautiful area that tourists  
**[0:23:59-0:24:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:23:59):**  flock there so you know one way we do that for example is goats are just so ecologically  
**[0:24:06-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:24:06):**  a such an ecologically appropriate way of producing food and manure for us so we're  
**[0:24:13-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:24:13):**  trying to get the goats pregnant now so that their milk will drop off during the during  
**[0:24:18-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:24:18):**  the rainy season and that they'll be giving birth and we can wean them in time for the  
**[0:24:24-0:24:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:24:24):**  for the high season again you know that's a good strategy but it's still not ideal because  
**[0:24:31-0:24:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:24:31):**  you know keeping animals is is tricky and there's there's constant costs associated  
**[0:24:37-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:24:37):**  with it so having no production for four months is is not ideal but it's also very hard to  
**[0:24:44-0:24:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:24:44):**  stagger a process like that you introduce a macho a male goat into your into your herd  
**[0:24:49-0:24:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:24:49):**  and he's gonna wanna have his fun with all the females you know that's the way it goes  
**[0:24:53-0:24:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:24:53):**  so actually ideally the more I look at this kind of permaculture stuff the more it jumps  
**[0:24:59-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:24:59):**  out at me that kind of communities and cooperatives are so so important because you know having  
**[0:25:09-0:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:25:09):**  multiple houses multiple places where where you can or you can put the animals is is so  
**[0:25:14-0:25:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:25:14):**  important and and then likewise having multiple producers working together so that you know  
**[0:25:23-0:25:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:25:23):**  sort of crops can be rotated you know that's such a basic thing you can it's not a good  
**[0:25:28-0:25:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:25:28):**  idea to plant the same crops on your on your land all the time ideally actually I think  
**[0:25:34-0:25:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:25:34):**  the way you know and Julie you can correct me if I'm wrong about this but I think you  
**[0:25:40-0:25:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:25:40):**  know indigenous people largely did do slash and burn agriculture here where they let their  
**[0:25:44-0:25:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:25:44):**  parcels go fallow and let the the forest eat it up again while they would then burn you  
**[0:25:52-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:25:52):**  know different sections of it down you don't see any of that kind of joined up thinking  
**[0:25:56-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:25:56):**  now and the sort of stuff that Michelle talked about where projections are being made really  
**[0:26:02-0:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:26:02):**  if you go around Guatemala know that we're coming just into rainy season everywhere is  
**[0:26:07-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:26:07):**  just naked it's all denuded hillsides and probably a mixture of about the same three  
**[0:26:13-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:26:13):**  or four crops are going to be planted on all of that land which is it economically for  
**[0:26:19-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:26:19):**  producers who are breaking their backs to do all this work this is a disaster no because  
**[0:26:23-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:26:23):**  they all then harvest their stuff at the same time and the market gets flooded with corn  
**[0:26:28-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:26:28):**  cabbage beans and you know whatever else and it's barely worth the time to do it right  
**[0:26:35-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:26:35):**  so ideally every group of small producers would kind of have an operation like Michelle  
**[0:26:41-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:26:41):**  and Julie looking after planning and logistics and and economics would be would be fantastic  
**[0:26:49-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:26:49):**  you know yeah I like how you mentioned the potential  
**[0:26:54-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:26:54):**  benefits for cooperative farming and organizations that help to build resilience within the business  
**[0:27:01-0:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:27:01):**  model now between you Julian Michelle can you talk a little bit about how you've facilitated  
**[0:27:08-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:27:08):**  connections between your producers and also your buyers in order to build resilience into  
**[0:27:14-0:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:27:14):**  the economic model of what can be otherwise quite a fragile economic endeavor which is  
**[0:27:21-0:27:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:27:21):**  producing food and is at the whim of fluctuations in the climate in the weather patterns and  
**[0:27:28-0:27:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:27:28):**  I think quite frankly here you can have situations where the road goes out during the rainy season  
**[0:27:33-0:27:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:27:33):**  due to landslides and other types of factors like that which could you know completely  
**[0:27:37-0:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:27:37):**  destroy a perishable crop what are some of the techniques or organizations that you help  
**[0:27:47-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:27:47):**  to facilitate through your business? Jeremy quite honestly we haven't built in that resistance  
**[0:27:55-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:27:55):**  or resilience yet and that's definitely something that we'd like to do right now we haven't  
**[0:28:01-0:28:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:28:01):**  found enough farmers to really have as a plan a plan b plan c strategy but what we what  
**[0:28:09-0:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:28:09):**  we're interested in doing and what we have done with the workshops and and other small  
**[0:28:14-0:28:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:28:14):**  meetings that we have with our producers is helping them connect between each other you  
**[0:28:19-0:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:28:19):**  know so for example one of our producers has incredible food concentrate for chickens and  
**[0:28:26-0:28:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:28:26):**  he makes it himself and it's it's all traceable really high quality products. Whoa what's  
**[0:28:31-0:28:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:28:31):**  he using that's cool I want to buy that. You do want to buy that it is the most amazing  
**[0:28:38-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:28:38):**  concert I've ever seen he makes it out of. Sorry to cut you off FYI I think a lot of  
**[0:28:43-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:28:43):**  thing people don't realize about raising chickens is it can it's such a nice way to get started  
**[0:28:48-0:28:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:28:48):**  producing your own food and compost and all the rest of it but unless you have a good  
**[0:28:53-0:28:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:28:53):**  supplier of of concentrates your chickens are not going to produce without a big input  
**[0:28:58-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:28:58):**  of sort of annual grains most of which are produced really really ecologically or responsibly  
**[0:29:05-0:29:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:29:05):**  right so even though you think you're sort of taking the step towards sustainability  
**[0:29:09-0:29:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:29:09):**  can actually be quite disheartening when you when you look at the inputs right. Yeah definitely  
**[0:29:15-0:29:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:29:15):**  years ago I was I was building a chicken coop for one of my clients and I remember just  
**[0:29:22-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:29:22):**  spending weeks researching how to make the proper concentrate and and what are the mixtures  
**[0:29:28-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:29:28):**  that you need and it's actually really complex I mean it's definitely something that you  
**[0:29:32-0:29:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:29:32):**  need to learn about and I never figured it out I was never able to do it. I think protein  
**[0:29:40-0:29:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:29:40):**  and calcium are two of the main things but there's also a whole load of trace elements  
**[0:29:44-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:29:44):**  that they need to be kind of productive and healthy right. Definitely yeah you can you  
**[0:29:48-0:29:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:29:48):**  can put in herbs and you can put in like for example curcuma turmeric you can put in flax  
**[0:29:54-0:29:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:29:54):**  to raise your omega levels but you can't pass it above you know like a three or five percent  
**[0:29:59-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:29:59):**  because then you damage the chicken and it's super interesting but I'll just go into...  
**[0:30:04-0:30:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:30:04):**  Of course access to fresh ground is also like key because then they can just sort of look  
**[0:30:08-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:30:08):**  after their own needs by by foraging but that's also not always easy to do. Yeah not everyone  
**[0:30:15-0:30:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:30:15):**  has access to open pastures where the chickens can be you know that's something that thinking  
**[0:30:20-0:30:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:30:20):**  about the Inga I mean perhaps if it was really well pruned you have to think that these are  
**[0:30:26-0:30:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:30:26):**  small producers that we're working with so they don't have massive amounts of land where  
**[0:30:30-0:30:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:30:30):**  they can just leave trees grow between the their crop systems but going back to the chickens  
**[0:30:36-0:30:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:30:36):**  what he uses his name's Jose Lopez he's fantastic I'll give you his contact and what he uses  
**[0:30:42-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:30:42):**  is a mixture of local this local tree that grows in the dry areas in Sa Capa and really  
**[0:30:54-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:30:54):**  high quality superfoods like Ramon and moringa yeah but definitely I'll get you in touch  
**[0:31:01-0:31:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:31:01):**  with with him and for example we're contacting him with another two producers who are also  
**[0:31:06-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:31:06):**  interested in producing chicken for for chicken breast and just meat. Our producer Juan we're  
**[0:31:17-0:31:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:31:17):**  connecting with another producer that has a céolita because they have two methods that  
**[0:31:21-0:31:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:31:21):**  could mix mix well really interestingly so this is the kind of connections that we're  
**[0:31:27-0:31:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:31:27):**  facilitating but we that's not a real like resilience method you know that's we haven't  
**[0:31:34-0:31:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:31:34):**  gone to that point yet but we are connecting farmers to each other to to share their experiences  
**[0:31:39-0:31:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:31:39):**  and to give each other information and backup when they need it and that's something that  
**[0:31:44-0:31:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:31:44):**  Michelle and I value a lot and we've talked about it a lot of creating whole regional  
**[0:31:50-0:31:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:31:50):**  networks of organic producers so that you don't feel alone and you know that there's  
**[0:31:55-0:31:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:31:55):**  someone to hold your hand when you need it you know and that's definitely something we  
**[0:31:58-0:32:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:31:58):**  value and so that each person can specialize because not everyone can produce their own  
**[0:32:03-0:32:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:32:03):**  animal feed look after animals tend to crops make their own high quality like Bokashi compost  
**[0:32:10-0:32:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:32:10):**  keep a seed bank keep a nursery there's so many elements to a successful farmer unless  
**[0:32:16-0:32:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:32:16):**  you have a huge budget and a lot of land then it makes more sense for different people to  
**[0:32:21-0:32:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:32:21):**  specialize sort of within a cooperative right yeah kind of sorta one of the things that  
**[0:32:28-0:32:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:32:28):**  we're trying to do is is the vivero the nursery where we're gonna have access to seeds different  
**[0:32:34-0:32:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:32:34):**  fertilizer options have the seedlings so that people can just come in by their seedlings  
**[0:32:40-0:32:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:32:40):**  and go straight into planting and that will facilitate their their seasonal plantings  
**[0:32:46-0:32:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:32:46):**  a lot I'm really glad that you both mentioned specializing within an agricultural system  
**[0:32:54-0:33:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:32:54):**  because like you said especially for small producers it's not practical to be producing  
**[0:33:01-0:33:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:33:01):**  so many different things and that leads really well into the topic that we're kind of gonna  
**[0:33:06-0:33:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:33:06):**  focus on for the rest of this episode normally we do listener questions and I'm just gonna  
**[0:33:11-0:33:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:33:11):**  consolidate them now into a topic that a lot of people have asked little bits around but  
**[0:33:18-0:33:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:33:18):**  we'll just kind of cover broadly here and that's the idea of the difference between  
**[0:33:23-0:33:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:33:23):**  food sovereignty and food security so Neil can you start us off a little bit about the  
**[0:33:29-0:33:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:33:29):**  difference between the two the pros and cons as you see them and we'll sort of analyze  
**[0:33:35-0:33:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:33:35):**  them in different contexts and see how that goes I say food sovereignty but you know so  
**[0:33:44-0:33:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:33:44):**  but I'm not sure if I'm right about that it's a tricky one to pronounce it's this is an  
**[0:33:49-0:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:33:49):**  interesting topic right I think everyone has heard the term food security not that many  
**[0:33:55-0:34:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:33:55):**  people have heard the term food sovereignty right so and they're quite conflicting a food  
**[0:34:03-0:34:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:34:03):**  security literally just means people have enough a supply of carbohydrates and grains  
**[0:34:11-0:34:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:34:11):**  to you know get them through a year or whatever I can't actually remember the exact definition  
**[0:34:17-0:34:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:34:17):**  for it but the problem with it is in trying to increase their food security a lot of countries  
**[0:34:24-0:34:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:34:24):**  particular particularly poor countries have started to import huge amounts of food so  
**[0:34:30-0:34:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:34:30):**  you have this like bizarre situation in Guatemala where even though everybody this is where  
**[0:34:36-0:34:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:34:36):**  corn was first domesticated Guatemala imports a huge percentage of its own corn and it's  
**[0:34:42-0:34:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:34:42):**  large four times more than four times what they what they consumer produce we import  
**[0:34:59-0:35:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:34:59):**  four times the amount of corn that we produce locally yeah that's like a staggering statistic  
**[0:35:06-0:35:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:35:06):**  right and that's mostly that mostly comes from the states right it's like mass-produced  
**[0:35:11-0:35:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:35:11):**  mechanized industrialized subsidized corn production and it gets dumped down here in  
**[0:35:17-0:35:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:35:17):**  the name of boosting food security right is that used for animal feed or for for processing  
**[0:35:26-0:35:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:35:26):**  in kind of tortrix facilities or what is it for that's a good question I don't know  
**[0:35:35-0:35:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:35:35):**  so it can be consumed for different things but the statistic is we import four times  
**[0:35:40-0:35:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:35:40):**  as much corn as we consume and consumption can be yeah we import we import four times  
**[0:35:48-0:35:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:35:48):**  as much corn as we produce yeah produce and and consumption of that corn varies but a  
**[0:35:56-0:36:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:35:56):**  lot of it I don't know the percentage but a big percentage of it is for individual consumption  
**[0:36:02-0:36:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:36:02):**  yeah and when can I add one thing about fortified foods I think when you're talking about food  
**[0:36:09-0:36:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:36:09):**  security one of the main things to mention as you were saying a lot of the food they'd  
**[0:36:13-0:36:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:36:13):**  causes countries to import a lot of the food to address food security I think one of the  
**[0:36:17-0:36:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:36:17):**  issues also is with fortified foods right to address chronic child malnutrition and  
**[0:36:22-0:36:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:36:22):**  things like that so if you want to address chronic child malnutrition through importing  
**[0:36:29-0:36:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:36:29):**  foods you can't just go in the middle I don't know I think you just I think you just have  
**[0:36:44-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:36:44):**  to talk about like how these imported foods are used to make fortified foods to address  
**[0:36:49-0:36:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:36:49):**  malnutrition as well yeah and so kind of understandably this idea of of food security got very tiring  
**[0:36:59-0:37:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:36:59):**  for people and groups like Via Campesina started to use much more the term food sovereignty  
**[0:37:06-0:37:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:37:06):**  which they defined as the rights of a people to produce their own food to have access to  
**[0:37:22-0:37:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:37:22):**  produce to have to produce and to have access to their own food sources that will be enough  
**[0:37:27-0:37:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:37:27):**  and more than enough to fulfill all their dietary needs that's food sovereignty where  
**[0:37:33-0:37:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:37:33):**  they're independent within their own community to produce their own so here did it Via Campesina  
**[0:37:40-0:37:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:37:40):**  defined it defined it as the right of the people who produce distribute and consume  
**[0:37:46-0:37:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:37:46):**  food should control the mechanisms and policies of food production and distribution rather  
**[0:37:52-0:37:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:37:52):**  than the corporate corporations and market institutions they believe have come to dominate  
**[0:37:57-0:38:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:37:57):**  the global food system right so this term is quite politically laden but I have a lot  
**[0:38:05-0:38:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:38:05):**  of sympathy with the with let's say the perspective at hand here because we touched on this in  
**[0:38:13-0:38:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:38:13):**  the last interview Julie Guatemala is in this like bizarre situation where it it really  
**[0:38:18-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:38:18):**  is you can look at the whole country like a great big farm and there's all these amazing  
**[0:38:23-0:38:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:38:23):**  things like moringa and coconuts and mangoes and vegetables and just about everything grows  
**[0:38:28-0:38:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:38:28):**  here and yet you have this bizarre situation where the people who spend their time producing  
**[0:38:34-0:38:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:38:34):**  all these foods often have very high levels of malnutrition right so kind of like addressing  
**[0:38:41-0:38:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:38:41):**  this idea of food sovereignty kind of goes right to the heart of this huh it does and  
**[0:38:48-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:38:48):**  there's something really particular and bothersome about the situation for me because from my  
**[0:38:56-0:39:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:38:56):**  point of view yes they have they have access to really high nutritious value content or  
**[0:39:04-0:39:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:39:04):**  highly nutritious food sources for example purslane growing in the fields like a weed  
**[0:39:10-0:39:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:39:10):**  you know they have we have chilka for if we have medicinal problems we have um bleto which  
**[0:39:17-0:39:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:39:17):**  is like the leaves of the amaranth plant we have all these these incredible food sources  
**[0:39:25-0:39:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:39:25):**  and you just all the things you mentioned there are like one of a handful of what's  
**[0:39:30-0:39:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:39:30):**  actually hundreds of kind of like edible weeds that you don't even really need to cultivate  
**[0:39:34-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:39:34):**  in a lot of situations things that just proliferate probably in in forests or in meadows so you  
**[0:39:41-0:39:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:39:41):**  know you're almost surrounded by these things exactly so it's not that there is a lack of  
**[0:39:47-0:39:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:39:47):**  high quality food it that's not the problem here you know which begs the question okay  
**[0:39:54-0:39:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:39:54):**  then what is the problem like why aren't these people eating these food sources anymore you  
**[0:39:59-0:40:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:39:59):**  know why is diabetes one of the most prevalent diseases in Guatemala now what's going on  
**[0:40:05-0:40:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:40:05):**  with that i mean that's that's the million dollar question it does seem to be um when  
**[0:40:13-0:40:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:40:13):**  i look at countries like Guatemala that there's been this kind of um situation where the people  
**[0:40:18-0:40:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:40:18):**  have become bombarded with both advertising and a huge amount of of cheap food just being  
**[0:40:26-0:40:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:40:26):**  made available cheap low quality food being made available and it's almost like sometimes  
**[0:40:33-0:40:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:40:33):**  i feel like this idea of like development which is always talked about down in down  
**[0:40:38-0:40:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:40:38):**  in countries like Guatemala it's almost like a way to turn producers who used to live a  
**[0:40:44-0:40:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:40:44):**  kind of a subsistence lifestyle which you could argue is an ideal you could argue there's  
**[0:40:51-0:40:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:40:51):**  a glass ceiling on the opportunities to have and all the rest of it but what's largely  
**[0:40:54-0:40:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:40:54):**  happened here over the last sort of 50 or 60 years it seems to me is a lot of those  
**[0:40:58-0:41:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:40:58):**  people have been turned from producers into consumers and now instead of producing food  
**[0:41:03-0:41:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:41:03):**  they produce coffee or mass produce like one type of food which either gets exported or  
**[0:41:10-0:41:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:41:10):**  sold on markets and subsist on kind of coca-cola and tortrix and and a bunch of other like  
**[0:41:16-0:41:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:41:16):**  really really low quality uh foods you know  
**[0:41:23-0:41:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:41:23):**  yeah it gets kind of tricky and politically charged when you get into the base of the  
**[0:41:27-0:41:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:41:27):**  food system because there's a lot of culprits there's a lot of things that can be pointed  
**[0:41:32-0:41:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:41:32):**  to for blame and you know hopefully for solutions but this is where it gets a little bit controversial  
**[0:41:39-0:41:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:41:39):**  you know oliver i definitely like what you said about about you know trying to find blame  
**[0:41:46-0:41:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:41:46):**  because i think a lot of the time we get stuck on that and i i know i do you know like getting  
**[0:41:51-0:41:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:41:51):**  stuck on the idea of blame and it's whose blame is it and is it their blame or then  
**[0:41:55-0:42:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:41:55):**  we say okay no let's take responsibility it's my my blame you know but really that  
**[0:42:00-0:42:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:42:00):**  there there is no need for blame at all what we need is really solutions you know so yeah  
**[0:42:06-0:42:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:42:06):**  i think that for me that's a really big challenge that i'm facing right now of of realizing  
**[0:42:12-0:42:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:42:12):**  that we can't get caught up on on the crappy things that are happening because there's  
**[0:42:18-0:42:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:42:18):**  enough downers in the world already you know so we really need to focus on okay so we have  
**[0:42:24-0:42:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:42:24):**  all these solutions we have all these incredible foods and incredible mechanisms and we have  
**[0:42:30-0:42:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:42:30):**  the technique and the know-how and we're building the community with people like you guys and  
**[0:42:35-0:42:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:42:35):**  us to to create the change that we want to see and then you know just really make it  
**[0:42:41-0:42:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:42:41):**  happen and and stop lollygagging and stop finding the perfect moment and the thinking  
**[0:42:47-0:42:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:42:47):**  that everything needs to be in the proper place before we can just go for it and and  
**[0:42:53-0:42:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:42:53):**  i think that for me that's been a big lesson recently  
**[0:42:56-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:42:56):**  i love that you brought that up because it's something that we talk a lot about in the  
**[0:43:01-0:43:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:43:01):**  courses that we do through permaculture and natural building is that all of the elements  
**[0:43:05-0:43:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:43:05):**  don't need to be perfect for you to start making actionable steps in fact the imperfections  
**[0:43:10-0:43:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:43:10):**  of them are often where you do the most learning i know this is something that you harp on  
**[0:43:13-0:43:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:43:13):**  a lot as well neil you don't have to have all the money all the funding all the materials  
**[0:43:17-0:43:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:43:17):**  or the circumstances don't have to be perfect but you can make small steps and there's often  
**[0:43:23-0:43:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:43:23):**  a lot of things that you can do which will be universally useful regardless of your climate  
**[0:43:28-0:43:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:43:28):**  your context um shad talks about about this a lot in previous uh interviews as well things  
**[0:43:35-0:43:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:43:35):**  like you know figuring out where your water source is starting to propagate plants and  
**[0:43:40-0:43:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:43:40):**  put a vivero and even if you don't know exactly where on the landscape you're going to put  
**[0:43:44-0:43:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:43:44):**  them yet getting started and taking a little bit more time to observe and interact but  
**[0:43:51-0:43:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:43:51):**  still make progress is very empowering for a lot of people who have otherwise been waiting  
**[0:43:57-0:44:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:43:57):**  or like you said lollygagging very english term um in order to to start the ball rolling  
**[0:44:05-0:44:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:44:05):**  yeah it's like i agree so much with what um what julie says it's totally right because  
**[0:44:10-0:44:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:44:10):**  these these global scale problems are so daunting and i feel like they leave a lot of people  
**[0:44:15-0:44:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:44:15):**  paralyzed but also the truth the truth of the matter is there's things that we're trying  
**[0:44:21-0:44:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:44:21):**  to figure out and resolve that we're just we have no idea what the answers are like  
**[0:44:26-0:44:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:44:26):**  some of these large-scale problems they're literally unsolvable from where we are right  
**[0:44:33-0:44:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:44:33):**  now but you know we feel pretty confident in the steps that we're taking with abundant  
**[0:44:39-0:44:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:44:39):**  edge i feel super confident listening to the steps that these girls are taking and lots  
**[0:44:45-0:44:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:44:45):**  of other people around the place are taking and slowly the questions like you know how  
**[0:44:51-0:44:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:44:51):**  do we design how do we come up with a sort of a more equitable economy that's fair to  
**[0:44:57-0:45:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:44:57):**  everybody how do we solve some of these problems like making organic food available not just  
**[0:45:03-0:45:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:45:03):**  to wealthy people who can afford to buy it but to everybody i mean you could go on and  
**[0:45:08-0:45:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:45:08):**  on and on with the list of problems that there are to solve but we can't let those things  
**[0:45:12-0:45:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:45:12):**  sort of prevent action right now and we sort of have to trust that the steps we're taking  
**[0:45:16-0:45:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:45:16):**  will will take us in a place where in five or ten or twenty years we're ready to solve  
**[0:45:22-0:45:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:45:22):**  those next sets of problems right yeah absolutely and i think it goes along as to what you were  
**[0:45:28-0:45:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:45:28):**  talking about being inclusive and broad in the plan so you can be very idealistic in  
**[0:45:35-0:45:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:45:35):**  what your larger overarching goals are and start with something as simple as planting  
**[0:45:40-0:45:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:45:40):**  a garden or attempting to source some of your products and your consumption from more responsible  
**[0:45:47-0:45:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:45:47):**  and equitable sources and you know with the larger goal in mind as you gain more resources  
**[0:45:54-0:46:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:45:54):**  as you increase your reach your collaborations with more entities within the community then  
**[0:46:00-0:46:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:46:00):**  you can start to bring in more more members of the community and take on more ambitious  
**[0:46:07-0:46:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:46:07):**  projects that are seemingly directly in line with those ambitions that you had from the  
**[0:46:12-0:46:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:46:12):**  get-go but that shouldn't stop you from the small steps that it takes to get the ball  
**[0:46:17-0:46:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:46:17):**  rolling yeah definitely just taking action is a big a big step and i've been thinking  
**[0:46:24-0:46:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:46:24):**  a lot about how to get people to take action and how to inspire people in general and and  
**[0:46:33-0:46:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:46:33):**  create that movement and i i've been thinking that often we want to convince people about  
**[0:46:40-0:46:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:46:40):**  what we want and the future that we foresee and that doesn't really transfer well when  
**[0:46:47-0:46:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:46:47):**  you're trying to have a you know a really profound impact on somebody's psyche so that  
**[0:46:54-0:47:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:46:54):**  they themselves want to change something in their lives and i i was talking to my grandfather  
**[0:47:00-0:47:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:47:00):**  yesterday the day before yesterday and he's absolutely brilliant i mean he's 96 years  
**[0:47:04-0:47:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:47:04):**  old he has read every interesting book that there is to read and the conversations i have  
**[0:47:10-0:47:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:47:10):**  with him are seriously the most awesome thing so if you have a grandfather out there definitely  
**[0:47:14-0:47:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:47:14):**  go chat him up because he was probably smarter than you are but back to my point we were  
**[0:47:19-0:47:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:47:19):**  talking and he was and we always talk about these kind of issues you know we're talking  
**[0:47:23-0:47:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:47:23):**  about you know why humanity is so sick and why everything is based on greed and why again  
**[0:47:30-0:47:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:47:30):**  and again we replay these same scenarios you know and he was like yeah you know the last  
**[0:47:34-0:47:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:47:34):**  person who tried to create change like this was jesus and then it was carl marks and all  
**[0:47:39-0:47:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:47:39):**  these things always fail and i'm like yeah but you know why they fail because they think  
**[0:47:43-0:47:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:47:43):**  of humanity as a hive they think that we're going to i'm going to give something that  
**[0:47:48-0:47:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:47:48):**  i've worked for so the so someone else i don't even know can benefit and that just doesn't  
**[0:47:54-0:48:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:47:54):**  sit well with our evolutionary footprint like we're not that species you know where did  
**[0:48:02-0:48:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:48:02):**  we come from think of it as an evolutionary system we are tribal we're tribal beings we're  
**[0:48:10-0:48:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:48:10):**  only going to do things that are going to benefit our tribe but not some kind of an  
**[0:48:15-0:48:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:48:15):**  abstract individual that we have no connection to because we feel part of something grandiose  
**[0:48:22-0:48:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:48:22):**  and and huge like a bee like a bee is a part of a hive and everything that one bee does  
**[0:48:29-0:48:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:48:29):**  ultimately benefits the whole system and the bee isn't thinking like well where are my  
**[0:48:33-0:48:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:48:33):**  comforts and when am i going to have access to a bigger cell you know like when am i going  
**[0:48:38-0:48:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:48:38):**  to be able to eat some of that tasty stuff that the other person's eating you know like  
**[0:48:42-0:48:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:48:42):**  bees aren't thinking that but we are you know i i'm driving around in my in my car and i'm  
**[0:48:47-0:48:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:48:47):**  like like oh that piece of land is so nice like when am i going to get a piece of land  
**[0:48:52-0:48:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:48:52):**  like that you know like each of us has something that we want and i think that if we learn  
**[0:48:57-0:49:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:48:57):**  to speak to that tribal persona instead of the hive persona we're going to get through  
**[0:49:05-0:49:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:49:05):**  to a lot more people have you guys thought about this i mean does that ring any bells  
**[0:49:09-0:49:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:49:09):**  i have these are the types of conversations that we have all the time and like i think  
**[0:49:15-0:49:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:49:15):**  this has been a fantastic platform because it's a great way to have these conversations  
**[0:49:21-0:49:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:49:21):**  among ourselves but also include a much larger community of those of you who are listening  
**[0:49:26-0:49:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:49:26):**  and i really hope that that is what people are getting from this we don't pretend to  
**[0:49:30-0:49:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:49:30):**  have all of the answers we're working on these and figuring these things out as we go it's  
**[0:49:35-0:49:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:49:35):**  fascinating it's uh it's something that we all love to do and facilitates the conversation  
**[0:49:40-0:49:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:49:40):**  and the exploration and innovation towards something positive um but definitely it's  
**[0:49:45-0:49:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:49:45):**  an ongoing process and the hope the reason why we do this on a podcast and not just by  
**[0:49:51-0:49:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:49:51):**  ourselves and in a house is because we would love to hear from you and hear some contributions  
**[0:49:56-0:50:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:49:56):**  some feedback ideas and experiences from all of you who are listening as well yeah it's  
**[0:50:03-0:50:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:50:03):**  it is such a good point about you know us having evolved to we function in tribes and  
**[0:50:09-0:50:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:50:09):**  i mean i guess is a tribe and a beehive that different i mean they've got to have like  
**[0:50:15-0:50:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:50:15):**  a healthy tribe to me functions best when everyone is doing everyone is acting simultaneously  
**[0:50:22-0:50:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:50:22):**  in their own self-interest and in the interest of the tribe right but on what we're kind  
**[0:50:29-0:50:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:50:29):**  of faced with now i think is that whether we like it or not the whole world is connected  
**[0:50:34-0:50:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:50:34):**  and the actions of people in one area of the world you know whether we want to or not influence  
**[0:50:40-0:50:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:50:40):**  everybody else so we are sort of faced with that thing where we do kind of need to make  
**[0:50:46-0:50:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:50:46):**  the whole planet into one tribe in how we in how we think and act at least into at least  
**[0:50:53-0:50:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:50:53):**  in terms for me kind of like this idea of it's such a cliche but you know thinking globally  
**[0:50:58-0:51:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:50:58):**  and acting locally you know it's like i recognize that how i use energy and consume resources  
**[0:51:06-0:51:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:51:06):**  affects the whole globe and that probably the most appropriate way appropriate way to  
**[0:51:11-0:51:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:51:11):**  address that is is by is by consuming as much local product produce and energy as i can  
**[0:51:19-0:51:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:51:19):**  no yeah definitely that's a good point that we do need to think globally in in the decisions  
**[0:51:27-0:51:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:51:27):**  overall that we make but i think this is the perfect moment to say that each person out  
**[0:51:32-0:51:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:51:32):**  there who's listening has access to their own small tribe people i don't have access  
**[0:51:38-0:51:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:51:38):**  to and people that i don't know and so that's more what i'm going to when i say tribe it's  
**[0:51:43-0:51:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:51:43):**  you know like you you could still be part of my tribe you know like we hang out maybe  
**[0:51:49-0:51:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:51:49):**  maybe oh sorry all over molliver you were invited to my tribe too i'll consider you  
**[0:51:53-0:52:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:51:53):**  my tribe now yeah i like you so this is this could work you know but no but seriously if  
**[0:52:01-0:52:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:52:01):**  each person from a grassroots standpoint gets the ball rolling and does things that are  
**[0:52:10-0:52:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:52:10):**  immediate to that tribe that's when i think that there's going to be movement you know  
**[0:52:15-0:52:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:52:15):**  because if i'm going to start thinking about what how my actions are going to influence  
**[0:52:20-0:52:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:52:20):**  someone in australia that's way too abstract you know like i don't even know what that  
**[0:52:25-0:52:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:52:25):**  means and it doesn't inspire me to change you know it's like oh like if i don't throw  
**[0:52:30-0:52:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:52:30):**  this piece of trash somewhere in the pacific ocean a fish isn't gonna die you know and  
**[0:52:37-0:52:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:52:37):**  that that doesn't move me but what does move me is i'm going down the street i'm looking  
**[0:52:42-0:52:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:52:42):**  at trash everywhere and i'm thinking of solutions and then i act on those solutions you know  
**[0:52:46-0:52:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:52:46):**  like what are what are building methods that i can use to use this trash as a resource  
**[0:52:52-0:52:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:52:52):**  let's do it now you know for example i had this really cool idea let's see what you think  
**[0:52:57-0:53:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:52:57):**  using cement posts or quinine posts that thomas has access to thomas is my husband that thomas  
**[0:53:03-0:53:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:53:03):**  has access to and then putting chicken wire on both sides and then stuffing the center  
**[0:53:10-0:53:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:53:10):**  with unrecyclable trash and using that as the bahadeke method instead of using cane  
**[0:53:18-0:53:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:53:18):**  or adobe and that way and then just using plaster on the outside because the land that  
**[0:53:23-0:53:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:53:23):**  thomas bought has amazing resource for for fine clay material that i think we can use  
**[0:53:30-0:53:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:53:30):**  as a as the exterior wall to the parameter of our of our property you know like i see  
**[0:53:36-0:53:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:53:36):**  that now we're gonna try it out i'm already like storing up the plastic and we're gonna  
**[0:53:42-0:53:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:53:42):**  try it you know it's like i see the problem it's it's local it's close to me it affects  
**[0:53:46-0:53:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:53:46):**  me directly like my drive home is full of trash i need to find a solution for it now  
**[0:53:52-0:54:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:53:52):**  i'm gonna go for it what do you think i think it's a very creative idea and uh in fact that's  
**[0:54:00-0:54:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:54:00):**  something that we've got to do a full episode on at some point is rerouting certain types  
**[0:54:07-0:54:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:54:07):**  of trash out of the waste system and finding new creative uses within a community to help  
**[0:54:14-0:54:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:54:14):**  you know advance the infrastructure and solve problems i think things like that are absolutely  
**[0:54:18-0:54:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:54:18):**  brilliant and you know different people are motivated by different things like you mentioned  
**[0:54:26-0:54:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:54:26):**  some people think larger in what they include within their tribe i'm very glad to be included  
**[0:54:31-0:54:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:54:31):**  in yours now this is actually the first time that julie and i are meeting in person i've  
**[0:54:36-0:54:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:54:36):**  heard about her and we've done the you know the interviews in the past but this is the  
**[0:54:40-0:54:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:54:40):**  first time i got to meet you in person it was really fun but the larger point being  
**[0:54:44-0:54:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:54:44):**  that people are motivated by different um kind of pressure points you mentioned that  
**[0:54:49-0:54:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:54:49):**  your drive back home is something that is sort of glaring out at you and motivating  
**[0:54:54-0:55:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:54:54):**  you to find solutions for that thing um and it really is a matter of figuring out how  
**[0:55:01-0:55:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:55:01):**  to move larger populations by discovering their motivation points it's something that  
**[0:55:06-0:55:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:55:06):**  i'm constantly thinking about in order to help uh advance the movement in a way that  
**[0:55:11-0:55:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:55:11):**  connects with people on an individual level as well yeah i mean at some point i think  
**[0:55:16-0:55:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:55:16):**  we have to come clean on this and and be honest and say we are trying to create a sort of  
**[0:55:21-0:55:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:55:21):**  a cultural movement with with permaculture agroecology you know basic ecological thinking  
**[0:55:29-0:55:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:55:29):**  um because that's what humans have always done we've always uh that book sapiens um  
**[0:55:37-0:55:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:55:37):**  is a really good example of of analyzing the mythology of humans and how it's such an integral  
**[0:55:43-0:55:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:55:43):**  part to to how we construct our reality is is essentially by telling stories about it  
**[0:55:48-0:55:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:55:48):**  um and you know we are trying whether we kind of want to admit it or not sometimes it's  
**[0:55:56-0:56:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:55:56):**  uncomfortable but there's a there's this kind of cultural appropriation site to permaculture  
**[0:56:01-0:56:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:56:01):**  where we are clearly trying to use leverage points in how we communicate with each other  
**[0:56:06-0:56:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:56:06):**  how we tell stories how we construct our realities to change the value system of our of our culture  
**[0:56:13-0:56:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:56:13):**  you know right now we have a culture that says um that it's worth cutting down a standing  
**[0:56:19-0:56:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:56:19):**  tree because it gets you x number of piece of paper with money on it we most of us understand  
**[0:56:27-0:56:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:56:27):**  that that's just an abstract value system and it can be changed and you could perhaps  
**[0:56:31-0:56:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:56:31):**  print money because uh for every 10 liters of water that you clean or for every tree  
**[0:56:38-0:56:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:56:38):**  that you leave standing there's there's really no um there's nothing objective that says  
**[0:56:45-0:56:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:56:45):**  that the way we're doing things is the way we have to keep doing things but what it does  
**[0:56:49-0:56:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:56:49):**  require is the sort of cultural narrative and the stories that we collectively believe  
**[0:56:53-0:56:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:56:53):**  in to change and sort of the tricky thing about telling stories is you know i always  
**[0:56:59-0:57:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:56:59):**  look at those great disney movies and pixar movies where they're enjoyable for kids and  
**[0:57:05-0:57:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:57:05):**  adults there's a little bit of an element of that to it too that when you're talking  
**[0:57:09-0:57:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:57:09):**  to people you need to be aware that different people react to different pressure points  
**[0:57:13-0:57:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:57:13):**  so you know when you're talking about organic agriculture it can be a really good idea to  
**[0:57:19-0:57:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:57:19):**  go on about the money you save by not applying chemical fertilizers if you're talking to  
**[0:57:25-0:57:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:57:25):**  someone whose main interest is economics or it can be a good idea to talk about how a  
**[0:57:33-0:57:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:57:33):**  good holistic design can save you tons of labor by eliminating unnecessary tasks that  
**[0:57:39-0:57:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:57:39):**  you have to pay workers for you know and in a way that those things will not only be in  
**[0:57:45-0:57:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:57:45):**  not interesting but actually possibly jarring to someone who's more concerned with um pulling  
**[0:57:51-0:58:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:57:51):**  carbon down out of the air and reversing climate change and exactly what you guys are doing  
**[0:58:00-0:58:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:58:00):**  you're you're appealing to people who are living probably mostly urban lifestyles and  
**[0:58:04-0:58:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:58:04):**  showing them the health benefits that they can get but all these different all these  
**[0:58:09-0:58:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:58:09):**  different ways of approaching the problem the the real hope for me is that some kind  
**[0:58:15-0:58:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:58:15):**  of like cultural tipping point gets created and i really don't think we're that far away  
**[0:58:20-0:58:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:58:20):**  from it because when you actually look at this stuff there are so many um just advantages  
**[0:58:26-0:58:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:58:26):**  on so many different levels right and this is clearly a topic that we can go endlessly  
**[0:58:34-0:58:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:58:34):**  down the rabbit hole on we're starting to get a little bit abstract about the concepts  
**[0:58:38-0:58:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:58:38):**  of communication uh cultural narratives and storytelling but all of it is relevant when  
**[0:58:44-0:58:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:58:44):**  it comes to making shifts that have real impact on people's lives not just something that  
**[0:58:51-0:58:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:58:51):**  gets caught up in in pop culture and starts to motivate people based on what's fashionable  
**[0:58:58-0:59:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:58:58):**  uh i i think i speak for all of us when i say that if we make any change we want it  
**[0:59:02-0:59:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:59:02):**  to be lasting and not just something that sort of passes with interest in in something  
**[0:59:08-0:59:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:59:08):**  that's new and shiny so um the the intricacies in in telling stories but ones that will actually  
**[0:59:15-0:59:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:59:15):**  endure and that will inspire generations past us who maybe are dealing with very different  
**[0:59:20-0:59:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:59:20):**  problems within their environment their societies their governments whatnot um so any any insights  
**[0:59:26-0:59:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:59:26):**  on that well just one quick insight that i think really matters to all of us is is becoming  
**[0:59:33-0:59:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:59:33):**  aware of what resources we have access to identifying these resources and then putting  
**[0:59:38-0:59:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:59:38):**  them into play because everyone does have something that they can start with and for  
**[0:59:46-0:59:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:59:46):**  me i think the idea of of how we're tiny in a great gigantic cosmos puts everything into  
**[0:59:55-1:00:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=0:59:55):**  perspective and and just helps me not get caught up in in the mistakes and when i do  
**[1:00:01-1:00:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=1:00:01):**  make mistakes just see them as opportunities for for betterment and change and creativity  
**[1:00:10-1:00:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=1:00:10):**  and and i'm so thankful for the day and age that we we live in you know where i can pick  
**[1:00:15-1:00:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=1:00:15):**  up the phone and call neil and ask him for advice or i can call you oliver and pick your  
**[1:00:21-1:00:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=1:00:21):**  brain about know that we're all in a tribe that is exactly not now that i can call you  
**[1:00:26-1:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=1:00:26):**  oliver and i'll get your number later made the invitation official exactly oh my gosh  
**[1:00:33-1:00:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=1:00:33):**  you guys speaking of awesome projects and invitations my mom wants to create a community  
**[1:00:39-1:00:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=1:00:39):**  like a a ecological beautiful community of like-minded people i think that we need to  
**[1:00:48-1:00:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=1:00:48):**  have a podcast about that yeah definitely but uh i'm not going to publish this part  
**[1:00:52-1:00:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=1:00:52):**  i'm going to edit this out so that not too many people join in and we get it we get it  
**[1:00:56-1:01:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=1:00:56):**  on the ground floor keep that on the down low um no it's it's remarkable and one of  
**[1:01:04-1:01:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=1:01:04):**  the the narratives that i've really caught on to in the past is that you know you do  
**[1:01:08-1:01:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=1:01:08):**  get a lot of pushback from opposing sides who don't like all of the things in the stories  
**[1:01:13-1:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=1:01:13):**  that we tell and i you know i even have members of my family who who identify as like non-environmentalist  
**[1:01:19-1:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=1:01:19):**  which you know if you want to appeal to folks like that if our species doesn't continue  
**[1:01:25-1:01:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=1:01:25):**  on this planet that's fine like the universe is not going to miss us if you want the species  
**[1:01:32-1:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=1:01:32):**  to continue you can frame it as a selfish thing we want to go on because it's in our  
**[1:01:38-1:01:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=1:01:38):**  best interest if if you want to break it down if that's the way that it makes sense to you  
**[1:01:43-1:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=1:01:43):**  you know it doesn't have to be this altruistic thing that you're doing for the good of the  
**[1:01:47-1:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=1:01:47):**  planet and other abstract ideas which are all fantastic and i mean those are motivations  
**[1:01:51-1:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=1:01:51):**  for me but if you know you disagree for some reason for the political side of things that  
**[1:01:56-1:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=1:01:56):**  tends to get associated with that be selfish with it like do you want to keep living because  
**[1:02:02-1:02:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=1:02:02):**  when you realize that you can't eat your cell phone and that your water is polluted we're all  
**[1:02:08-1:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=1:02:08):**  going to be in the same boat facing the exact same problem yeah i mean i think the whole thing with  
**[1:02:13-1:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=1:02:13):**  this whole this whole movement is take the politics out of it you know global warming is  
**[1:02:19-1:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=1:02:19):**  triggering to for some reason you know 40 50 percent of western populations because it brings  
**[1:02:26-1:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=1:02:26):**  up all these kind of political things and so much of the these political debates just lead to  
**[1:02:32-1:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=1:02:32):**  massive stagnant stagnation and no i don't know anybody alive whether they're republican or  
**[1:02:38-1:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=1:02:38):**  democrat or anarchist or whatever that doesn't want their kids to have access to clean food  
**[1:02:44-1:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=1:02:44):**  water and air and this is really all we're trying to do nobody's denying it whether they're climate  
**[1:02:50-1:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=1:02:50):**  change denier or a flat earth theory theorist or whatever they are you know basic concepts like  
**[1:02:57-1:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=1:02:57):**  photosynthesis trees pull in carbon and and turn it into you know sugar and oxygen these are like  
**[1:03:06-1:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=1:03:06):**  well established things plants clean water you know so for me it's like keep the politics out  
**[1:03:13-1:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=1:03:13):**  of it and you can have a very agreeable i can have a very agreeable conversation with these types of  
**[1:03:18-1:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=1:03:18):**  things about a staunch with a staunch right-winger or a hardline communist or and find loads and  
**[1:03:25-1:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=1:03:25):**  loads of points that we agree on and and really that's the thing because every human that you  
**[1:03:30-1:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=1:03:30):**  meet no matter how different they seem to you i guarantee you you have way way way more in common  
**[1:03:35-1:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=1:03:35):**  with them then then you don't i just want to point out something oliver said about how each  
**[1:03:45-1:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=1:03:45):**  person gets inspired by something different and i think what inspires me most and we're talking  
**[1:03:52-1:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt-4/#t=1:03:52):**  about this with michelle earlier you know what inspires me most is that incredible beauty and

**[0:01:12-0:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:01:12):**  Hey everybody and welcome back!  
**[0:01:14-0:01:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:01:14):**  Now today we're going to start a brand new series.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:01:17):**  Over the next couple of months, we'll be exploring a wide variety of perspectives and  
**[0:01:21-0:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:01:21):**  knowledge about tree planting, agroforestry, forestry management, and everything to do  
**[0:01:26-0:01:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:01:26):**  with woody perennial species.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:01:28):**  In the last couple of years, you've probably seen a ton of articles and promotions about  
**[0:01:32-0:01:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:01:32):**  reforestation and tree planting initiatives around the world.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:01:36):**  Many of these are tied to specific climate change mitigation metrics, and it's become  
**[0:01:40-0:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:01:40):**  more and more apparent just how vital trees are for the health of life on this planet.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:01:46):**  You may have also seen a lot of critical hit pieces about the inefficacy about many of  
**[0:01:51-0:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:01:51):**  these same planting projects when they're poorly planned or executed.  
**[0:01:55-0:01:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:01:55):**  And as it turns out, you can't just go throwing any old tree in the ground anywhere and hoping  
**[0:01:59-0:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:01:59):**  that it will either survive, thrive, or have a beneficial impact on the local ecology.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:02:05):**  The truth is that there's a need for better planting project planning, based on essential  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:02:10):**  environmental observations and long-term maintenance plans that are the difference between catchy  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:02:15):**  programs with big numbers attached to them and initiatives that actually grow trees and  
**[0:02:20-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:02:20):**  can transform the health of the environments and communities where they're grown.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:02:25):**  There are so many good reasons to integrate trees into the majority of our landscapes,  
**[0:02:29-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:02:29):**  and today I'm going to kick off this series by looking at the advantages from an investment  
**[0:02:34-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:02:34):**  perspective of planting profitable agroforestry systems.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:02:38):**  Now in order to explain the complexities of financial modeling for perennial agriculture  
**[0:02:42-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:02:42):**  systems, I caught up with Harry Green.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:02:45):**  Harry is the co-founder and chief investment officer for Propagate Ventures, an agroforestry  
**[0:02:51-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:02:51):**  investment platform focused on bridging the capital and the operational needs to integrate  
**[0:02:56-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:02:56):**  tree crops into farmland.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:02:58):**  They've built agroforestry analytics and project development tools to support farmers  
**[0:03:02-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:03:02):**  in the design, implementation, and management of tree crop systems to increase farm profitability  
**[0:03:08-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:03:08):**  and ecological capacity.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:03:11):**  By partnering with operational farms and internationally renowned farm designers, they work to implement  
**[0:03:16-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:03:16):**  realistic, functional agroforestry solutions.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:03:20):**  Propagate is known for working with their partner farms' operational requirements,  
**[0:03:23-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:03:23):**  conventional or organic, to deploy proven agroforestry practices.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:03:28):**  From ranches to small family farms to large-scale grain operations, they can help to find solutions  
**[0:03:34-0:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:03:34):**  that fit in for any business type.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:03:37):**  Harry has also traveled around the world researching agroforestry systems and traditions, and in  
**[0:03:41-0:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:03:41):**  this episode we're going to cover a really wide variety of topics.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:03:46):**  Harry starts by explaining the origins of Propagate Ventures and how he and his partner  
**[0:03:50-0:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:03:50):**  saw an opportunity to make strong investment cases for tree-based production systems.  
**[0:03:55-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:03:55):**  From there we go into the barriers that growers and investors face to starting agroforestry  
**[0:04:00-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:04:00):**  systems and some of the solutions to getting past them.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:04:03):**  We also talk about the tools that their software OverYield makes available when planning the  
**[0:04:07-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:04:07):**  potential profitability of a new agroforestry investment, and some of the key considerations  
**[0:04:13-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:04:13):**  that are automated in the platform.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:04:16):**  This talk is also a lot more than the business and financial case for planting trees on farms.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:04:20):**  We go deep into the practical considerations of planting at different scales, the amendments  
**[0:04:25-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:04:25):**  and assistance that can help trees to survive the first crucial years, the many configurations  
**[0:04:30-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:04:30):**  of tree planting that can complement rather than hinder other farm enterprises, and a  
**[0:04:35-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:04:35):**  whole lot more.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:04:36):**  So with that out of the way, let's kick off this new series and I will hand things over  
**[0:04:41-0:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:04:41):**  to Harry Green.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:04:43):**  Harry, I would love to hear about how Propagate Ventures came together from the beginning.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:04:50):**  What are the concepts that brought the team together and turned this into a company?  
**[0:04:55-0:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:04:55):**  Yeah, of course.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:04:56):**  It started out in 2016, so five years ago, almost six years ago now, Jeremy and I and  
**[0:05:07-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:05:07):**  Ethan all got together to answer the question, how can we make trees a bankable asset?  
**[0:05:14-0:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:05:14):**  How can we link up sources of capital and agroforestry to be able to diversify landscapes,  
**[0:05:22-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:05:22):**  farms, livelihoods, etc.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:05:26):**  And so Jeremy and I were introduced to a mutual friend who were doing food redistribution  
**[0:05:30-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:05:30):**  work in Colorado.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:05:32):**  Ethan and Jeremy went to university together.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:05:35):**  And yeah, we all hit it off from there.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:05:38):**  Had about a year of R&D before we officially incorporated and then in October of 2017 really  
**[0:05:44-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:05:44):**  got going.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:05:46):**  And so Propagate also seems to be founded on a strong belief that agroforestry is a  
**[0:05:52-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:05:52):**  smart investment for both the ecology and financially.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:05:57):**  Can you break down some of the advantages that tree based systems bring?  
**[0:06:01-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:06:01):**  Definitely.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:06:02):**  Yeah.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:06:03):**  So first we'll go with income diversification.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:06:06):**  Having more than one yield on a given area is always good to diversify risk out of the  
**[0:06:15-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:06:15):**  system and diversify and also diversify kind of an income certainty into the fold.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:06:23):**  Ecologically, agroforestry will go from, say, two to eight tons of carbon per acre per year.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:06:33):**  I always get confused between carbon and CO2, which numbers I'm pulling out.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:06:37):**  But the carbon is a really good indicator species.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:06:41):**  And then the more species you add, there's that plant biodiversity pushing into insect  
**[0:06:47-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:06:47):**  biodiversity, bird biodiversity, and then farther down the line, things like clean water  
**[0:06:53-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:06:53):**  flowing off the land.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:06:54):**  Trees absorb a whole lot more runoff than just annuals and just grass alone.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:06:59):**  And where did you guys approach this topic from?  
**[0:07:02-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:07:02):**  Do any of you in the team have a background in farming or is this mostly from a financial  
**[0:07:08-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:07:08):**  investment perspective?  
**[0:07:09-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:07:09):**  It's a good question.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:07:11):**  It's mostly the latter.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:07:13):**  We all went to business school and the passion was really around regenerative agriculture,  
**[0:07:21-0:07:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:07:21):**  tree crops, living landscapes, we'll say impact investing as well.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:07:28):**  And there are a whole lot of ways to learn farming, whether that's in the field, growing  
**[0:07:34-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:07:34):**  up with it, going and working on farms.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:07:37):**  And we really have a mix of that.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:07:39):**  We've worked on farms through college, post college, and really learned on the ground  
**[0:07:45-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:07:45):**  what it's like to manage landscapes.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:07:47):**  Yeah, I can definitely relate to that.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:07:50):**  That's been my route into farming as well.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:07:52):**  I didn't grow up this way, though.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:07:55):**  My parents, like early in their childhood, my mother grew up on a farm, but that disconnect  
**[0:08:01-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:08:01):**  from the lands was enough that I had to find my way back in.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:08:06):**  And I think it also changes a lot of people's perspective when they don't have sort of a  
**[0:08:10-0:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:08:10):**  legacy way of farming that they're coming from.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:08:14):**  And it opens up opportunities.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:08:16):**  And so with that perspective of business management and looking at this from the financial side,  
**[0:08:23-0:08:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:08:23):**  how have you managed to relate to and connect with growers over their priorities as well  
**[0:08:29-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:08:29):**  as the opportunities that you and the team see?  
**[0:08:33-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:08:33):**  It's a really good question.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:08:34):**  I'll go back to a bit of groundwork just in how we think about finance in long term systems.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:08:44):**  It was honestly back in 2012, a finance textbook had a photo of a poplar plantation on the  
**[0:08:53-0:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:08:53):**  cover.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:08:54):**  And I was reading a textbook on agroforestry at the same time.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:08:57):**  And the long term value of these systems and communicating that with modern financial analysis  
**[0:09:05-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:09:05):**  really clicked.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:09:06):**  It was a light bulb.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:09:07):**  It was an aha moment.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:09:10):**  And that's kind of the academic perspective.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:09:14):**  But if we look at the returns that agriculture, annual crop farming, commodity livestock have  
**[0:09:24-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:09:24):**  yielded over the past 20 years, it's around 5 percent and below.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:09:29):**  So farmers, land managers, land owners are looking for alternatives.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:09:36):**  And things like fruit, timber, tree nuts, those perennial systems that really stack  
**[0:09:43-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:09:43):**  value on the land was appealing to a whole lot of folks.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:09:47):**  And we do definitely have a product adoption curve.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:09:50):**  I'm going to try and verbally depict what that looks like.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:09:55):**  If you think about a bell curve on the left tail, you have the innovators and then the  
**[0:10:00-0:10:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:10:00):**  early adopters, then the early majority and the late majority are in the middle of the  
**[0:10:03-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:10:03):**  bell curve.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:10:04):**  And then you have the laggards over on the right.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:10:07):**  So really that's in order of how soon people are going to adopt a new or frankly old practice  
**[0:10:16-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:10:16):**  as far as tree crops are concerned.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:10:19):**  So I'd say we are in getting into the early majority of who we're working with the farther  
**[0:10:27-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:10:27):**  we go along.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:10:28):**  Amazing.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:10:29):**  And just like you said, this is a new old proposition.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:10:33):**  Agroforestry was integrated on farms throughout pretty much all of human history.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:10:38):**  And it's only in recent decades, mostly since the Green Revolution, mechanization and the  
**[0:10:45-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:10:45):**  growth of agribusiness that tree crops have been pushed out for a number of different  
**[0:10:50-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:10:50):**  reasons.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:10:52):**  But I also have connected with a lot of growers who remember this from when they grew up farming.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:10:59):**  And there's still a connection there.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:11:01):**  Has that been what you found in the communication with the people that you work with that they  
**[0:11:05-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:11:05):**  remember this?  
**[0:11:06-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:11:06):**  Or is it still more of a, okay, we're going to try something new, even though there is  
**[0:11:10-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:11:10):**  a history to back it up?  
**[0:11:12-0:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:11:12):**  Yeah, it's definitely a bit of both.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:11:16):**  Agroforestry really being, as you said, it's the second for oldest form of agriculture.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:11:21):**  People do have these recollections of hedgerows and orchards and diversified farms.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:11:25):**  About, I'd say it was post World War I, post World War II, we had the fencer to fencerow  
**[0:11:33-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:11:33):**  Earl Butts, who was the secretary of agriculture, grain cropping across the Midwest, etc.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:11:41):**  And in terms of calories per acre, that is an excellent way to produce food.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:11:47):**  But over the long term, you're kind of liquidating your principle and just decreasing the capacity  
**[0:11:53-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:11:53):**  of the land to produce all sorts of sustenance.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:11:57):**  So folks are really interested in something that yields food, fuel, fiber, etc.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:12:05):**  And at the same time, we'll say sequesters carbon, restores ecosystems and makes, we'll  
**[0:12:12-0:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:12:12):**  say the vast ag landscapes of the world a bit more habitable.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:12:18):**  Indeed.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:12:19):**  Now, we've gone through a lot of the advantages, the connections and such of agroforestry systems.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:12:25):**  But what are you finding are the biggest barriers to adoption here?  
**[0:12:29-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:12:29):**  Where do you feel there's still pushback?  
**[0:12:31-0:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:12:31):**  Yep.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:12:32):**  So the hardest part we've found is access to capital.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:12:38):**  Farmers can go out and get an operating loan for a row crop or livestock operation like  
**[0:12:44-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:12:44):**  dairy farming.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:12:45):**  They can get a mortgage to go and buy land.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:12:50):**  Tree crops are kind of in between those two categories with a longer time to break even.  
**[0:12:58-0:12:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:12:58):**  And then you don't even get yields.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:12:59):**  You don't get revenue for a number of years, say three to seven to even 15 to 20 plus years  
**[0:13:06-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:13:06):**  for timber.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:13:07):**  And looking at accessible equity and debt options for farmers to be able to access capital  
**[0:13:19-0:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:13:19):**  is really the, that's the spark.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:13:23):**  That's the light bulb that goes off for people.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:13:25):**  It's a commonality between climates, regions, cultures and yeah, everything in that fold.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:13:37):**  With those barriers, especially from the financial side, where have you seen some of the opportunities  
**[0:13:41-0:13:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:13:41):**  for overcoming them?  
**[0:13:43-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:13:43):**  Is it a matter of implementing a project little by little in chunks that an average grower  
**[0:13:49-0:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:13:49):**  can afford?  
**[0:13:50-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:13:50):**  Or are there other financial institutions or organizations out there that are increasingly  
**[0:13:55-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:13:55):**  interested in taking on the loans or helping out the initial investment?  
**[0:14:02-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:14:02):**  So financial institutions are very much interested in climate smart agriculture.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:14:09):**  We'll say it's, you can call it carbon negative, regenerative agriculture, all the names for  
**[0:14:16-0:14:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:14:16):**  it.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:14:18):**  The sticking point that we've found is really understanding when the cash flow occurs and  
**[0:14:26-0:14:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:14:26):**  when the cash outlays occur.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:14:30):**  So in honestly having an understanding of the costs, revenues, yields, labor assumptions,  
**[0:14:37-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:14:37):**  our internal rate of return, net present value, all the things that traditional financial  
**[0:14:42-0:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:14:42):**  analysis runs through, all of those will say de-risk or increase certainty around these  
**[0:14:49-0:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:14:49):**  systems.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:14:50):**  And once there's that framework that's readily available, accessible to farmers and financial  
**[0:14:57-0:15:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:14:57):**  institutions, then the gears really get turning.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:15:00):**  Got it.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:15:01):**  And is that one of the aspects that you're working within the industry to improve or  
**[0:15:06-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:15:06):**  is that just something that you are hoping will start to come into place so that more  
**[0:15:11-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:15:11):**  people will come to you for services?  
**[0:15:13-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:15:13):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:15:15):**  It's definitely the former.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:15:17):**  We started out doing it all manually with GIS tools, spreadsheets.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:15:21):**  We actually ran out of cells in Google Sheets.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:15:25):**  Oh, man.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:15:27):**  Because right now we've upgraded to a software platform.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:15:30):**  And what was formerly a whole lot more than this, there are still about 1,500 data points  
**[0:15:35-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:15:35):**  per crop per farm.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:15:38):**  And moving towards a system that, or actually our software that enables rapid prototyping  
**[0:15:46-0:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:15:46):**  of agroforestry over 30 years and looking at all the different parameters, aspects of  
**[0:15:53-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:15:53):**  that is really what we're focused on in order to increase the frequency and scope and breadth  
**[0:16:03-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:16:03):**  of tree planting.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:16:05):**  Tree blending specifically, it's where we're starting with, but if you look at any long-term  
**[0:16:10-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:16:10):**  enterprise, the returns on fencing, on ponds, on irrigation, on different livestock systems,  
**[0:16:18-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:16:18):**  that's all definitely a possibility on overyield.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:16:20):**  Okay.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:16:21):**  Well, so let's start digging deeper into that and the services that you offer through Propagate.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:16:27):**  Walk me through a situation, let's say a client comes to you.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:16:30):**  What are some of the initial things that you need to know and the steps in which you walk  
**[0:16:35-0:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:16:35):**  them through to assess the viability of an enterprise like this?  
**[0:16:39-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:16:39):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:16:40):**  So I think the best way to look at this is through the Agrarian's platform.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:16:45):**  I'll review it if any of the listeners aren't directly familiar.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:16:50):**  Yeah, we're both on that platform, but let's walk the listeners through it.  
**[0:16:55-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:16:55):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:56-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:16:56):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:16:57):**  So I'll come back to something a little bit more succinct on how we work with landowners  
**[0:17:03-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:17:03):**  to de-risk tree crops for them.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:17:07):**  But really what we're looking at first, I'll just list the layers that we're looking at.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:17:14):**  It's climate is number one.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:17:16):**  Number two is geography.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:17:18):**  Number three is water.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:17:20):**  Number four is access and roads could be access to markets.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:17:24):**  Number five is forestry.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:17:25):**  And then you have buildings, fencing, soil, economy, energy.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:17:29):**  And that's really a scale of permanence where it goes from most difficult to change to easiest  
**[0:17:35-0:17:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:17:35):**  to change.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:17:36):**  And where we start is climate.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:17:41):**  And that's not just weather patterns, but it's really the climate of the mind, the holistic  
**[0:17:46-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:17:46):**  context of the practitioners, what they want to see out of their farm business, out of  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:17:51):**  their family unit lives, livelihoods, et cetera.  
**[0:17:56-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:17:56):**  So really looking into what motivates folks, how they want to be living their life, how  
**[0:18:01-0:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:18:01):**  they want to be working with other people.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:18:04):**  And that's applicable not just to an individual farm.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:18:09):**  It really goes up to what does a agribusiness want to do with a certain initiative?  
**[0:18:16-0:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:18:16):**  What are they really looking to accomplish?  
**[0:18:18-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:18:18):**  And the reason that we dive in so much there is because you can plant corn and plant soy  
**[0:18:25-0:18:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:18:25):**  the next year, but you can't plant apples and then plant peaches in the same spot in  
**[0:18:32-0:18:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:18:32):**  two years in a row.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:18:34):**  So tree crops, they're much more of a commitment and really understanding what makes people  
**[0:18:41-0:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:18:41):**  tick, what makes a business operate.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:18:43):**  Their mission statement is really key to understanding which crops fit them best.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:18:49):**  And that could range from berries to tree fruit to chestnuts to short rotation timber  
**[0:18:55-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:18:55):**  to riparian buffers, browse and fodder systems for livestock.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:19:00):**  It's a huge selection, huge array of different perennials that can really fit different contexts.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:19:10):**  So I'll pause for maybe I'll pause for this.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:19:14):**  I'll just keep going from there.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:19:17):**  That's really the social systems.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:19:19):**  I'll just quickly add in that access to capital and the whole financial tolerance gamut.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:19:28):**  But from there, we have to look at what the land can support, soil types, slope, etc.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:19:36):**  And then access to water, access to markets.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:19:40):**  And yeah, from there, we select a few preliminary crop types, do some prototyping of what the  
**[0:19:49-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:19:49):**  financials look like and really start this integrated back and forth with folks who want  
**[0:19:56-0:19:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:19:56):**  to see tree crops on their land.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:19:58):**  What we're moving towards with that and really what we have right now starting out is a software  
**[0:20:04-0:20:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:20:04):**  platform where a user can log in and more and more seamlessly run through all of those  
**[0:20:14-0:20:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:20:14):**  different parameters and bit by bit channel in on something that is a really good fit  
**[0:20:21-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:20:21):**  for what they want to do on their land.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:20:23):**  Yeah, that is a really good description and succinct walkthrough of the scale of permanence  
**[0:20:29-0:20:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:20:29):**  that the regrarian platform expanded.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:20:31):**  I use it a lot myself and I am fascinated to see how you've integrated so many of these  
**[0:20:37-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:20:37):**  elements and their planning into the software on over yield.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:20:41):**  Like I was mentioning before, some members of your team gave us an introduction into  
**[0:20:47-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:20:47):**  this work at the team at Climate Farmers.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:20:50):**  And this is the first tool that I've really seen that makes the mapping of key line patterns  
**[0:20:56-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:20:56):**  on a farm so simple.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:20:59):**  And that's been missing in the space for quite a long time.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:21:02):**  You have to be pretty tech savvy to use other tools and it can be kind of cumbersome.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:21:07):**  Whereas this just putting it onto a landscape very similar to what Google Earth offers and  
**[0:21:14-0:21:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:21:14):**  the one that I'm most used to working with does that layout really seamlessly.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:21:18):**  And then you can basically drag and drop agroforestry configurations onto that, which my goodness  
**[0:21:25-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:21:25):**  is a lot of time and headache.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:21:28):**  How did you guys start to develop this and when, or I guess, I'm sure this has gone through  
**[0:21:33-0:21:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:21:33):**  a number of iterations.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:21:35):**  What were the first things that you focused on and what are some of the ones that you're  
**[0:21:38-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:21:38):**  planning for the future?  
**[0:21:40-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:21:40):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:21:41):**  You have it right there.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:21:42):**  It's pretty much draw a line on a map or draw a grid or draw a key line pattern and get  
**[0:21:48-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:21:48):**  financials.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:21:49):**  But where we started out was doing all of this by hand.  
**[0:21:53-0:22:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:21:53):**  So key line patterning on a combination of AutoCAD, QGIS, QGIS and Google Earth.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:22:02):**  And then coupling those row lengths derived from the KML files, et cetera, funneling those  
**[0:22:10-0:22:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:22:10):**  through a spreadsheet backend and then manually presenting everything in a software called  
**[0:22:16-0:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:22:16):**  Notion.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:22:17):**  It's kind of like an integrated live PDF software, our web platform.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:22:24):**  And that would take us at least 40 hours per form.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:22:30):**  And the idea is that we should get that right now, if it's pretty seamless, it might be  
**[0:22:36-0:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:22:36):**  around eight hours per form.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:22:41):**  If the user is ready to kind of work through all the parameters and then we're trying to  
**[0:22:46-0:22:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:22:46):**  get to the point where you could theoretically design and plant a system in a day.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:22:52):**  Wow.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:22:53):**  Yeah, that's definitely working towards economies of scale there.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:22:56):**  If you can access the turnaround time like that.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:23:01):**  And having looked at it as well, it's still pretty early in development stages as to where  
**[0:23:07-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:23:07):**  you see it going.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:23:08):**  I know we've looked into things like intercropping strategies, which at the moment it's not built  
**[0:23:14-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:23:14):**  for as well as some of the other configurations that you're looking for in climates outside  
**[0:23:20-0:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:23:20):**  of the ones that you have access to, like in the Hudson Valley and where they were in  
**[0:23:24-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:23:24):**  Kentucky when we were on the call.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:23:27):**  Where do you see this developing in the future?  
**[0:23:30-0:23:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:23:30):**  Yeah, I think two avenues there.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:23:36):**  The first one that you alluded to more or less is alley cropping.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:23:43):**  So intercropping of, we'll say, grain or livestock between rows of trees.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:23:50):**  And we have a back end, we'll call it, it's an alpha, which is basically a pre-software  
**[0:23:57-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:23:57):**  model of that, where when you increase the tree density, so trees per hectare, trees  
**[0:24:03-0:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:24:03):**  per acre, the size of the tree, the canopy width and depth, you get an understanding  
**[0:24:10-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:24:10):**  of how much shade there is in irradiance, so how much light is being intercepted and  
**[0:24:18-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:24:18):**  how much is going through the canopy to the ground to grow that understory.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:24:23):**  And from there, we can look at yields of C3 and C4 grasses, so corn, soy, wheat, cotton,  
**[0:24:32-0:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:24:32):**  et cetera, and then along with those cool and warm season grasses and how they respond  
**[0:24:38-0:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:24:38):**  to shade in the different years.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:24:40):**  So year one is going to have less shade than year 15.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:24:44):**  And then secondarily with livestock, the stat that we usually go back to is that for every  
**[0:24:49-0:24:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:24:49):**  hot day, beef cattle will gain about 60% more weight per day when they have access to tree  
**[0:24:56-0:24:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:24:56):**  shade or they'll produce, say, 20% more milk.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:24:59):**  And that's from studies in Kentucky and Florida.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:25:02):**  So intercropping and silvopasture is definitely where the system is going in terms of land  
**[0:25:08-0:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:25:08):**  equivalency ratio and the true definition of overyield, which is having more than one  
**[0:25:14-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:25:14):**  yield on a certain area.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:25:16):**  Secondarily, in mostly tropical climates, you have the ABAB in row patterning.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:25:25):**  So whether that's a combination of breadfruit and coffee or timber trees and cacao or any  
**[0:25:33-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:25:33):**  combination of trees like that, then a way to, it's not too far off, but most of our  
**[0:25:43-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:25:43):**  client base is in temperate climate, colder North America, where you could have, say,  
**[0:25:51-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:25:51):**  apples and pears or different tree crops interspersed in the same row, but people aren't really  
**[0:25:56-0:25:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:25:56):**  doing that in cold places.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:25:59):**  But as we move into the tropics, we have a project in Hawaii that's becoming more and  
**[0:26:05-0:26:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:26:05):**  more popular.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:26:06):**  Yeah, that makes sense.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:26:08):**  And also it's in line with what you were talking about in the beginning about the diversification  
**[0:26:12-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:26:12):**  of income streams for resilience of a business as well as for all the ecological benefits  
**[0:26:18-0:26:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:26:18):**  that come with that.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:26:20):**  And I was wondering too, what are some of the most important factors to consider in  
**[0:26:25-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:26:25):**  the financial assessment of an agroforestry enterprise?  
**[0:26:28-0:26:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:26:28):**  We talked about how this is more or less automated in the software, but what are some of these  
**[0:26:32-0:26:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:26:32):**  crucial considerations that can make or break the success of something like this?  
**[0:26:37-0:26:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:26:37):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:26:38):**  I'll start off high level and then get a bit more granular.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:26:42):**  So if we think about an income statement with revenues minus costs equals net income, that's  
**[0:26:51-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:26:51):**  the first matrix of information that's really core to understanding the financial health  
**[0:26:59-0:27:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:26:59):**  of a system.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:27:00):**  From their statement of cash flows, balance sheet are derived.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:27:05):**  The two metrics that we look at for the overall returns of the system, those key metrics would  
**[0:27:14-0:27:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:27:14):**  be the net present value and the internal rate of return.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:27:19):**  The net present value is in shorthand the value of all future net income or future cash  
**[0:27:27-0:27:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:27:27):**  flows expressed in today's dollars.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:27:30):**  So $100 is worth more to us today than it is in 10 years, but there's a way to phrase  
**[0:27:35-0:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:27:35):**  it, is $100 that we would receive in 10 years in 2022 dollars.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:27:41):**  So we look at the net present value and then the internal rate of return is basically,  
**[0:27:47-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:27:47):**  if you were to get a mortgage for a tree system, the IRR is the interest rate that the bank  
**[0:27:55-0:27:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:27:55):**  would have to charge you to eat up all of your profits.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:27:59):**  So it's the interest rate where the net present value is zero.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:28:02):**  That's some finance jargon, but definitely worth looking up on, say, Investopedia, et  
**[0:28:07-0:28:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:28:07):**  cetera, if you're unfamiliar.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:28:08):**  Really good ways to value tree crop systems.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:28:12):**  The other things that we have to look at are the bottlenecks in terms of both cash flow,  
**[0:28:20-0:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:28:20):**  so access to capital, providing pool of capital to actually go and manage a system before  
**[0:28:26-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:28:26):**  it breaks even, and then the labor bottlenecks as well.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:28:30):**  So how many people you're going to need for a certain activity at a certain time.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:28:34):**  Yeah, and I can imagine that depending on where a site is located, that could be one  
**[0:28:39-0:28:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:28:39):**  of the bigger challenges because of rural depopulation or perhaps even a worker base  
**[0:28:45-0:28:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:28:45):**  that is not trained in the types of tasks that are needed in an agroforestry system,  
**[0:28:51-0:28:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:28:51):**  which let's face it at the moment is still quite rare.  
**[0:28:54-0:28:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:28:54):**  Exactly.  
**[0:28:55-0:28:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:28:55):**  And that's a really good point.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:28:58):**  Consequently, we have to look at the tradeoff between using labor to accomplish a task or  
**[0:29:04-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:29:04):**  mechanizing the whole thing.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:29:07):**  And do you want to have assets on your balance sheet, such as some sort of harvester, or  
**[0:29:15-0:29:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:29:15):**  for how long and in what context do you want to hand harvest a crop?  
**[0:29:19-0:29:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:29:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:29:20):**  And when it comes to investing in something that does take such a long time to give a  
**[0:29:24-0:29:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:29:24):**  return on, relatively speaking, especially in contrast to annual cropping systems, how  
**[0:29:30-0:29:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:29:30):**  are you guys helping farmers to overcome the initial investment costs and the period that  
**[0:29:37-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:29:37):**  it takes for those trees to begin to produce with something that can generate cash in a  
**[0:29:42-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:29:42):**  shorter term?  
**[0:29:43-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:29:43):**  Yeah, it's a good question.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:29:45):**  So I think there's the fundamental question of how do we have access to capital to make  
**[0:29:54-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:29:54):**  the perennial system happen?  
**[0:29:57-0:30:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:29:57):**  I think we mostly reviewed or I'll dive into it a little bit more.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:30:03):**  Two ways to look at it, equity or debt financing.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:30:07):**  Debt financing, pretty simple, get a mortgage for your trees, down payment, and then annual  
**[0:30:11-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:30:11):**  payment on those tree crops.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:30:15):**  The catch is that if you say default or want to exit a mortgage on a house, then the house  
**[0:30:21-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:30:21):**  itself is collateral.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:30:23):**  And with equity financing trees, the way that's going to start is the tree crops themselves  
**[0:30:28-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:30:28):**  are collateral.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:30:29):**  So if someone wanted an exit from their debt finance system, then a third party entity  
**[0:30:34-0:30:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:30:34):**  could come on and say, manage a chestnut system in year five or year six.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:30:42):**  So I think the second part of that question is how do we generate short term before the  
**[0:30:49-0:30:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:30:49):**  yields come online, say of a long term crop?  
**[0:30:53-0:30:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:30:53):**  And alley cropping and silvopasture are really great ways to do that, depending on which  
**[0:30:59-0:31:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:30:59):**  species is in the silvopasture, whether that's larger livestock or poultry.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:31:05):**  Alley cropping, just to describe that for the listeners, is, I'll give an example, is  
**[0:31:11-0:31:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:31:11):**  say widely spaced rows of timber trees pruned up really high to let the light in with really  
**[0:31:18-0:31:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:31:18):**  anything that's an annual crop grown in between that could be wheat with a combine driving  
**[0:31:24-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:31:24):**  next to rows of trees that works better in some climates than others.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:31:28):**  The farther south you go, the better that's going to work, or farther closer to the equator  
**[0:31:35-0:31:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:31:35):**  rather than farther south.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:31:37):**  Why is that?  
**[0:31:38-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:31:38):**  Oh, just you have more light, more light hours.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:31:43):**  And you want to have a, so light and then growing degree days.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:31:50):**  So you have this short window in say Canada where you don't want shade.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:31:58):**  There's what's the word, where like a wheat kernel starts filling the flower.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:32:05):**  It's I'll think, maybe I'll think of the word in a second.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:32:08):**  It's okay, I don't remember the word either.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:32:11):**  In, we'll get to it.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:32:13):**  So you have to have enough light when the grain crops are starting out or else you don't  
**[0:32:17-0:32:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:32:17):**  really get any yield.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:32:19):**  And if you say have enough warmth in a Mediterranean climate and enough light before the trees  
**[0:32:26-0:32:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:32:26):**  have leafed out, then you can have winter wheat underneath the tree canopy in the off-season,  
**[0:32:32-0:32:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:32:32):**  in the trees off-season.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:32:34):**  So a bit of a tangent, but vegetables is another option specifically between shorter trees.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:32:43):**  We find that across, we'll say actually we'll say mostly in humid climates where agroforestry  
**[0:32:49-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:32:49):**  is I don't want to say more applicable, but more common below ground water and nutrient  
**[0:32:57-0:33:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:32:57):**  competition isn't nearly as big of a concern as the competition for light.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:33:02):**  So you really want to sync the overstory with the understory in regard to when you need  
**[0:33:07-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:33:07):**  light for both crops or when you don't want like, don't want heat, don't want that beating  
**[0:33:13-0:33:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:33:13):**  90 degree sun on black Angus cattle.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:33:17):**  Right, yeah, that makes sense.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:33:20):**  I know one of the examples that people often point to for especially grain cropping in  
**[0:33:26-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:33:26):**  between timber rows is the one I believe that you have the picture from of the farm in France  
**[0:33:33-0:33:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:33:33):**  that is probably the most referenced image to having this work where the combine is working  
**[0:33:39-0:33:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:33:39):**  through what look like poplars, I could be wrong.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:33:42):**  Yes, yeah, those are poplars at Rest in Cler in southern France and that, and when you  
**[0:33:48-0:33:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:33:48):**  say, when you describe agroforestry verbally, some people, it doesn't click, but then you  
**[0:33:54-0:33:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:33:54):**  pull up the photo and they say, oh, I didn't know you could do that.  
**[0:33:57-0:34:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:33:57):**  Yeah, it's powerful that way.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:34:00):**  But it's just simple, you have this really clear image of trees and a red tractor harvesting  
**[0:34:06-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:34:06):**  wheat.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:34:07):**  Right, and then how they're not in conflict, because there is still often a perception  
**[0:34:11-0:34:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:34:11):**  that trees and other types of cropping cannot coexist, that it removes the access for bigger  
**[0:34:18-0:34:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:34:18):**  machinery or that it has to go into some sort of backyard, hyper diverse permaculture sort  
**[0:34:25-0:34:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:34:25):**  of situation for it to work, whereas this is very widely applicable when it's correctly  
**[0:34:31-0:34:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:34:31):**  configured to climate, to economies, to different cropping systems.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:34:36):**  And I'm wondering where you started to see as you've been implementing projects and designing  
**[0:34:41-0:34:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:34:41):**  them, where have you found some of the configurations that have been most successful and have any  
**[0:34:47-0:34:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:34:47):**  of them actually started to reach their break even stage or really start to produce yet?  
**[0:34:52-0:34:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:34:52):**  Yeah, so we started planting in 2018.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:34:58):**  So we're in year four and trees grow pretty slowly in the cold climate.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:35:04):**  So we're just starting to see blackcurrant yields, so short shrub, mechanically harvested  
**[0:35:08-0:35:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:35:08):**  berries.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:35:09):**  You can grow anything you want in between.  
**[0:35:12-0:35:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:35:12):**  Livestock don't generally like the taste, deer don't eat them.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:35:15):**  You don't need a deer fence.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:35:18):**  They're a great combination with anything you want to grow in between as long as you  
**[0:35:23-0:35:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:35:23):**  don't need to.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:35:24):**  So when the harvester comes through in July or August, you want to have definitely room  
**[0:35:29-0:35:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:35:29):**  for them.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:35:31):**  That's true of any short mechanically harvested shrubs.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:35:34):**  So you can have pass caps into Saskatoon service berry, into blackcurrants, into aronia, and  
**[0:35:40-0:35:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:35:40):**  maybe blueberry if you really want to integrate.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:35:43):**  You can use the same harvester for a whole bunch of different types of purpleberries.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:35:48):**  That's one good combination, especially the farther north you go.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:35:51):**  So you see in Canada a lot of hascap or honey berry.  
**[0:35:55-0:35:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:35:55):**  It's a Lonicera serrula.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:35:59):**  You see a lot of that in an Amelantra alnifolia production, that Saskatoon service berry.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:36:05):**  Those small early bearing purple berries that work really well in cold climates.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:36:12):**  So there's that one.  
**[0:36:14-0:36:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:36:14):**  And then the farther south you go, the better a fit there is for silvopasture, which is  
**[0:36:22-0:36:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:36:22):**  largely I want to say as scalable as beef is, at least in humid climates.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:36:29):**  So places where there's enough rainfall for trees or enough access to irrigation if you  
**[0:36:35-0:36:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:36:35):**  want to have large ponds, dams, lakes high in the landscape and then use that water to  
**[0:36:41-0:36:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:36:41):**  grow trees and livestock.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:36:45):**  So the farther south you go, the more hot days you're going to have and then the greater  
**[0:36:49-0:36:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:36:49):**  the benefit the shade is to the livestock.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:36:51):**  So some place like Kentucky or Georgia, that's really the sweet spot because you have more  
**[0:36:56-0:37:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:36:56):**  hot days versus in, we'll say Vermont or northern, excuse me, southern Quebec, you might only  
**[0:37:02-0:37:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:37:02):**  have 10 hot days per year where the cattle would really benefit from access to tree shade.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:37:11):**  So that's really just in terms of economics for livestock in terms of shade.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:37:19):**  You also want to look at the returns on short rotation timber is a really good second species  
**[0:37:27-0:37:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:37:27):**  for cattle like black locust or hybrid poplar.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:37:31):**  For hardwood and then a normal, say commodity softwood, especially because they're deciduous  
**[0:37:38-0:37:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:37:38):**  and will let the light in for the grass to grow in the off season.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:37:41):**  I'll give one more combination or two more.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:37:46):**  Chestnuts were in the midst of really full steam ahead, scaling those up, recently planted  
**[0:37:54-0:37:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:37:54):**  half of what will be the largest chestnut farm, largest contiguous chestnut farm in  
**[0:37:59-0:38:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:37:59):**  North America.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:38:00):**  That's in Kentucky.  
**[0:38:02-0:38:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:38:02):**  So chestnuts and cattle will eventually work out.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:38:05):**  And then in the meantime, chestnuts when they're short trees and grain in between.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:38:10):**  And then lastly, cattle and woody browse.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:38:15):**  So you have these hedges of whether that's leucaena or mulberry or willow where the cattle  
**[0:38:21-0:38:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:38:21):**  will actually come in and eat the trees in addition to eating the grass.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:38:26):**  Yeah, these configurations are fascinating to me because I know how much research goes  
**[0:38:31-0:38:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:38:31):**  into the back end of figuring out where that sweet spot between the diversity that's needed  
**[0:38:35-0:38:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:38:35):**  for the resilience for the business and for the ecology meets with the necessity of simplification  
**[0:38:44-0:38:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:38:44):**  for efficiency and for being able to mechanize things like this.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:38:50):**  Where have been some of the difficult areas of squaring that circle in the balance of  
**[0:38:57-0:38:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:38:57):**  those factors?  
**[0:38:58-0:39:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:38:58):**  Yeah, yeah, the theme is increase ecological complexity while keeping management simple.  
**[0:39:03-0:39:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:39:03):**  And you can do it, you just have to plan for it.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:39:10):**  Whether that's understanding that for a certain number of years before the trees are above  
**[0:39:14-0:39:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:39:14):**  browse height, then you have to have ground that you're going to hay between instead of  
**[0:39:19-0:39:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:39:19):**  introducing livestock and how that fits into your grazing rotation.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:39:23):**  And things like how do you need to manage irrigation of tree crops in relation to everything  
**[0:39:34-0:39:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:39:34):**  else that's in your system?  
**[0:39:35-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:39:35):**  You don't want large machinery chopping up an above ground irrigation line, so you have  
**[0:39:41-0:39:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:39:41):**  to plan for all that.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:39:43):**  Yeah, it's really just a question of long term planning and making sure those most important  
**[0:39:50-0:39:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:39:50):**  and critical activities that occur throughout the year are in concert rather than in conflict  
**[0:39:58-0:40:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:39:58):**  between all of the different systems.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:40:01):**  And when we're talking about these hardy perennial systems, they definitely don't need the type  
**[0:40:06-0:40:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:40:06):**  of inputs and the intensity of pest management that annual crops do, at least very few of  
**[0:40:13-0:40:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:40:13):**  them do, especially if they're planted within the correct context of their area, their climate  
**[0:40:17-0:40:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:40:17):**  and such.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:40:19):**  That being said, you do still need some, especially if you're trying to get healthy yield out  
**[0:40:23-0:40:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:40:23):**  of these.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:40:24):**  Can you talk about some of the maintenance, but also some of the establishment inputs  
**[0:40:30-0:40:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:40:30):**  that you've found that are really helpful and make a real difference in the survival,  
**[0:40:34-0:40:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:40:34):**  especially in the first couple of years of the tree?  
**[0:40:37-0:40:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:40:37):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:40:38):**  Yeah, we'll go from maintenance right into establishment.  
**[0:40:44-0:40:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:40:44):**  So maintenance for fruit trees is really the most intensive, whether that's organic or  
**[0:40:50-0:40:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:40:50):**  conventional, you're going to have an air blast sprayer that's going through controlling  
**[0:40:55-0:41:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:40:55):**  for pests and then foliar feeding, a whole different assortment of inputs.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:41:02):**  And you want to make sure that, say, the track of the air blast sprayer isn't interfering  
**[0:41:07-0:41:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:41:07):**  with a crop in between those rows of trees and at the same time isn't, say, compromising  
**[0:41:15-0:41:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:41:15):**  what is being sprayed on a crop in between the apple trees at any given time.  
**[0:41:22-0:41:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:41:22):**  So that management, yeah, definitely have to take that into consideration, that overlap  
**[0:41:28-0:41:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:41:28):**  between the two crops.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:41:30):**  With installation, honestly, what we're moving towards for all of the crops given to different  
**[0:41:41-0:41:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:41:41):**  extents is extremely well-prepared soil.  
**[0:41:48-0:41:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:41:48):**  You can go into pasture, you can go into cropland and plant a tree, but to increase survivorship,  
**[0:41:55-0:42:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:41:55):**  to increase growth rate of those trees, say, with a high-value horticulture-intensive fruit  
**[0:42:03-0:42:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:42:03):**  crop, you almost want to prepare weed-free veg beds, whether that's conventional organic  
**[0:42:09-0:42:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:42:09):**  with tillage, mulch, et cetera.  
**[0:42:13-0:42:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:42:13):**  With timber trees at establishment, you do have species that will compete with grass,  
**[0:42:20-0:42:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:42:20):**  but eliminating that grass competition is really vital.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:42:24):**  So you want to ideally eliminate that herbaceous layer, at least for a few seasons.  
**[0:42:33-0:42:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:42:33):**  And then when there is livestock, or I'll say livestock, but animal pressure from deer  
**[0:42:38-0:42:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:42:38):**  or from hogs, you want to either have a deer fence or a hog fence and then tree tubes.  
**[0:42:45-0:42:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:42:45):**  So it looks like six-foot-tall plastic straws around each tree, and that protects the trees  
**[0:42:50-0:42:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:42:50):**  from both large wild animals and then rodents as well.  
**[0:42:56-0:43:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:42:56):**  Okay, and so do you go in and actually put any amendments in the soil as well?  
**[0:43:02-0:43:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:43:02):**  Have those worked out financially, or is it sufficient to simply prep the beds as if,  
**[0:43:08-0:43:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:43:08):**  like you said, they were veg beds?  
**[0:43:10-0:43:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:43:10):**  Yeah, oh, definitely, yeah.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:43:12):**  So a certain amount of compost for the horticulture-intensive crops.  
**[0:43:16-0:43:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:43:16):**  You want to add in things like gypsum, bone meal, green sand, whatever you need based  
**[0:43:21-0:43:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:43:21):**  on your soil test.  
**[0:43:24-0:43:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:43:24):**  And so you want to increase drainage.  
**[0:43:26-0:43:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:43:26):**  So you have hard pan.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:43:27):**  You might need to, in addition to using a subsoil or a keyline plow, to mechanically  
**[0:43:33-0:43:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:43:33):**  open up some space for the roots, is using things like rye and sudan grass to send cover  
**[0:43:38-0:43:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:43:38):**  crops to send roots farther down and create soil structure and drainage.  
**[0:43:43-0:43:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:43:43):**  So that's really important.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:43:46):**  And then things like compost tea, soluble mycorrhizae, liquid kelp, whether that's in  
**[0:43:55-0:44:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:43:55):**  a root dip to soak the trees in before you plant them, or applied the either fertigation  
**[0:44:02-0:44:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:44:02):**  or sprays later on to activate that soil biology is really key.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:44:07):**  And have you looked as well into what stage of development the tree is most likely to  
**[0:44:13-0:44:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:44:13):**  survive in as per how long it takes to actually mature?  
**[0:44:17-0:44:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:44:17):**  Because obviously, planting seeds can often be the best way for them to establish their  
**[0:44:21-0:44:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:44:21):**  roots and acclimate to the soil they're being put in.  
**[0:44:25-0:44:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:44:25):**  But you're greatly increasing the amount of time that is needed for them to mature or,  
**[0:44:31-0:44:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:44:31):**  in many cases, especially with those horticultural cultivars you're talking about, you would  
**[0:44:35-0:44:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:44:35):**  then have to go in and graft onto them.  
**[0:44:37-0:44:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:44:37):**  So that's not really feasible in a large scale.  
**[0:44:40-0:44:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:44:40):**  Is there an age of development where this really works out?  
**[0:44:43-0:44:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:44:43):**  Yeah, so it's a good question.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:44:46):**  And the farther south you go, the more frequently you see folks establishing trees from seed,  
**[0:44:52-0:44:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:44:52):**  whether that's, I see it a lot in centropic farming, where someone will just plant a 10  
**[0:44:59-0:45:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:44:59):**  foot tall tree in a year.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:45:03):**  And that's definitely less common in cold climates.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:45:07):**  The farthest north I've heard of a commercial producer putting tree seeds in the ground  
**[0:45:13-0:45:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:45:13):**  is with pecans, where they'll put native pecans as root stock down.  
**[0:45:18-0:45:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:45:18):**  So a native pecan seed, because you really want that taproot to go down and find the  
**[0:45:23-0:45:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:45:23):**  water and then graft onto it with selected varieties later.  
**[0:45:27-0:45:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:45:27):**  I've heard of some folks putting chestnuts on the ground and just selecting the best  
**[0:45:33-0:45:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:45:33):**  one that comes up.  
**[0:45:34-0:45:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:45:34):**  And you can do that.  
**[0:45:36-0:45:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:45:36):**  But I'd say there's a whole lot more success and certainty with planting either bare root  
**[0:45:40-0:45:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:45:40):**  or potted trees.  
**[0:45:43-0:45:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:45:43):**  When it comes to planning one of these enterprises, the scale is important for the profitability  
**[0:45:48-0:45:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:45:48):**  undoubtedly.  
**[0:45:50-0:45:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:45:50):**  And at a certain scale, you start to reduce the amount of overhead costs.  
**[0:45:55-0:45:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:45:55):**  And you also enter into different markets as well.  
**[0:45:59-0:46:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:45:59):**  Where are you really targeting this software and the types of designs that you are putting  
**[0:46:05-0:46:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:46:05):**  together for?  
**[0:46:06-0:46:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:46:06):**  And is it feasible when you get below a certain land size?  
**[0:46:10-0:46:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:46:10):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:11-0:46:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:46:11):**  So it's a really good question.  
**[0:46:13-0:46:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:46:13):**  I think there are two things to touch on there.  
**[0:46:15-0:46:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:46:15):**  The first is capex sensitivity, which to de-jargonify that, it's at what acreage or number of trees  
**[0:46:25-0:46:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:46:25):**  should you buy a certain implement for a tractor or basically a piece of metal?  
**[0:46:33-0:46:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:46:33):**  How much metal do you need and at what scale?  
**[0:46:36-0:46:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:46:36):**  Maybe in processing equipment at a certain point.  
**[0:46:40-0:46:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:46:40):**  Processing equipment and how do you amortize that?  
**[0:46:43-0:46:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:46:43):**  How do you depreciate it relative to production?  
**[0:46:46-0:46:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:46:46):**  In what year, given your yield, do you really actually need to buy it?  
**[0:46:52-0:46:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:46:52):**  That really pushes into your assumptions on how much you're going to sell retail and how  
**[0:46:57-0:47:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:46:57):**  much time that's going to take you combined with what you want to, I don't want to say  
**[0:47:01-0:47:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:47:01):**  liquidate but have a quicker, more assured market in terms of selling wholesale for a  
**[0:47:07-0:47:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:47:07):**  certain crop.  
**[0:47:09-0:47:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:47:09):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:10-0:47:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:47:10):**  Where have you found, like are there advantages to certain types of crops being sold directly  
**[0:47:15-0:47:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:47:15):**  to consumers and others where there's an advantage to entering into the commodity market?  
**[0:47:20-0:47:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:47:20):**  Yeah, so spending enough time to capture margin via retail sales is consistently the highest  
**[0:47:33-0:47:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:47:33):**  return per unit time in a system.  
**[0:47:38-0:47:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:47:38):**  The catch is there is that if you have perishable product and you need to turn it into something  
**[0:47:44-0:47:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:47:44):**  shelf stable, that can be a challenge.  
**[0:47:46-0:47:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:47:46):**  So say with fruit, whether that's turning it into frozen berries or juice or prepping  
**[0:47:53-0:47:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:47:53):**  it for sales later, value added products is a great way to capture margin.  
**[0:47:59-0:48:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:47:59):**  But you're doing so many things at once in the same season that you really need to have  
**[0:48:03-0:48:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:48:03):**  the ability to turn those processes on and off.  
**[0:48:08-0:48:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:48:08):**  Conversely, say with berries, if you're selling to an alcohol maker, that's usually one of  
**[0:48:15-0:48:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:48:15):**  the ways to sell a quality product to a more discerning buyer and achieve a better price.  
**[0:48:24-0:48:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:48:24):**  So the catch with a lot of these new crops, the pre-commodity crops, at least in the United  
**[0:48:29-0:48:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:48:29):**  States like chestnuts and blackcurrants, blackcurrants specifically, is that there's really no price  
**[0:48:34-0:48:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:48:34):**  floor.  
**[0:48:35-0:48:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:48:35):**  And what that means is that it's very difficult to just go somewhere and sell thousands of  
**[0:48:42-0:48:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:48:42):**  pounds of them because there's no commodity market that they can go right into.  
**[0:48:47-0:48:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:48:47):**  So you honestly have to market and have to take the time to find a buyer, find backup  
**[0:48:54-0:48:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:48:54):**  buyers, and really assure that you can reap the benefits of something that you put a whole  
**[0:48:59-0:49:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:48:59):**  lot of years into.  
**[0:49:00-0:49:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:49:00):**  Yeah, yeah, for sure.  
**[0:49:01-0:49:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:49:01):**  And I would imagine too that as you get into the processing of these, you start to look  
**[0:49:08-0:49:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:49:08):**  at bigger investments into cold storage, into transport, which becomes crucial if it's only  
**[0:49:15-0:49:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:49:15):**  good, if it's only shelf stable for a short amount of time, or the equipment or the kitchen  
**[0:49:20-0:49:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:49:20):**  equipment to process it on site and get it to a point where it's stable and you're under  
**[0:49:25-0:49:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:49:25):**  less of a time crunch.  
**[0:49:28-0:49:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:49:28):**  What sort of business models have you looked into for these?  
**[0:49:32-0:49:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:49:32):**  Yeah, so something that comes up a whole lot is the crunch time of when everyone needs  
**[0:49:41-0:49:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:49:41):**  a commercial kitchen, everyone needs a certain implement.  
**[0:49:44-0:49:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:49:44):**  So it is available to rent, but you really have to plan ahead to make that work.  
**[0:49:51-0:49:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:49:51):**  Juicing infrastructure is huge, bottling infrastructure.  
**[0:49:55-0:50:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:49:55):**  Right now, I'll go into chestnuts and then into timber.  
**[0:50:00-0:50:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:50:00):**  With chestnuts, there still is a large market for retail and wholesale and everything in  
**[0:50:06-0:50:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:50:06):**  between for fresh nuts.  
**[0:50:08-0:50:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:50:08):**  We probably, this is a bit back of the napkin, but have at least 5,000 acres of planting  
**[0:50:13-0:50:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:50:13):**  to go without latent demand kicking in to just satisfy fresh nut demand.  
**[0:50:24-0:50:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:50:24):**  And then we'll say 10x that to 50,000 acres, that's the point where the way people consume  
**[0:50:34-0:50:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:50:34):**  chestnuts would maybe turn into chestnut flour or pancake mix or something like that.  
**[0:50:39-0:50:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:50:39):**  So the more acreage you have, at least in the US, the more you're going to have to process  
**[0:50:47-0:50:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:50:47):**  things into a more consumable product as opposed to just a fresh whole food.  
**[0:50:52-0:50:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:50:52):**  With timber, they're always buyers for logs.  
**[0:50:57-0:51:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:50:57):**  But I think Darren said once that when you're selling logs, you're really just exporting  
**[0:51:01-0:51:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:51:01):**  carbon from your property.  
**[0:51:03-0:51:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:51:03):**  And it's astounding how folks will just kind of say, you know what, I'm just going to cut  
**[0:51:08-0:51:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:51:08):**  down these trees, logger gives them a certain amount of money.  
**[0:51:11-0:51:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:51:11):**  It's usually not nearly what they could make if they sold the sawn timber.  
**[0:51:18-0:51:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:51:18):**  And a really good way to do that is to have either a contracted portable sawmill come  
**[0:51:24-0:51:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:51:24):**  in or own your own sawmill.  
**[0:51:26-0:51:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:51:26):**  That scales down pretty well.  
**[0:51:30-0:51:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:51:30):**  And depending on the species, you can, it's honestly, it's the difference between a really  
**[0:51:38-0:51:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:51:38):**  far in the red negative return from selling logs to above a 10% IRR for selling sawn lumber.  
**[0:51:47-0:51:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:51:47):**  And you say you have 15, 20 years to market it.  
**[0:51:49-0:51:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:51:49):**  So yeah, creating those relationships with buyers before you have harvested logs is absolutely  
**[0:51:59-0:52:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:51:59):**  essential.  
**[0:52:00-0:52:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:52:00):**  Let's look into timber a little bit more because this is one of the areas that I know very  
**[0:52:04-0:52:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:52:04):**  little about.  
**[0:52:06-0:52:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:52:06):**  And I'm wondering where the assessments into the fast growing, but usually much lower value  
**[0:52:12-0:52:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:52:12):**  timber work out with the slower maturing, but higher value ones and how you calculate  
**[0:52:19-0:52:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:52:19):**  that out to make a decision what's going to work for you.  
**[0:52:22-0:52:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:52:22):**  Yeah, it's a good question.  
**[0:52:25-0:52:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:52:25):**  So I think it was on the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**[0:52:30-0:52:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:52:30):**  Dimitri recently interviewed someone who was, was it Francisco or I think it was in Italy.  
**[0:52:37-0:52:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:52:37):**  I don't think it was Francisco.  
**[0:52:38-0:52:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:52:38):**  I think Francisco is in Portugal.  
**[0:52:42-0:52:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:52:42):**  Name is escaping me, but it was Polycyclic Forestry, which I thought was a great name,  
**[0:52:47-0:52:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:52:47):**  which is the combination of those long-term hardwoods with the short-term faster growing  
**[0:52:53-0:52:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:52:53):**  early successional species.  
**[0:52:54-0:52:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:52:54):**  Interplanting them.  
**[0:52:55-0:52:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:52:55):**  Yeah, interplanting them.  
**[0:52:57-0:53:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:52:57):**  And I think you can do that.  
**[0:53:01-0:53:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:53:01):**  I think row by row would be better than AB or ABC, ABC planting in row.  
**[0:53:08-0:53:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:53:08):**  What that might look like, not might look like, what that has looked like in cold climates  
**[0:53:14-0:53:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:53:14):**  is there, there's actually a guy named Brett Chetsoy.  
**[0:53:17-0:53:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:53:17):**  He's in Watkins Glen, New York.  
**[0:53:18-0:53:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:53:18):**  He's a Cornell Cooperative Extension Forester and a livestock producer.  
**[0:53:22-0:53:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:53:22):**  So he has black locust, black walnut, silva pasture with a whole bunch of other species  
**[0:53:27-0:53:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:53:27):**  as well.  
**[0:53:28-0:53:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:53:28):**  But those are the main trees that he has.  
**[0:53:30-0:53:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:53:30):**  The locust is a fast growing early successional species.  
**[0:53:33-0:53:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:53:33):**  The walnut is a longer term hardwood.  
**[0:53:37-0:53:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:53:37):**  And basically you thin the locust out and then the walnut takes over the overstory.  
**[0:53:44-0:53:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:53:44):**  Now locust, it grows back, it coppices.  
**[0:53:48-0:53:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:53:48):**  You can kind of cut it once and then cut it again 15 years later from the same shoot,  
**[0:53:52-0:53:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:53:52):**  same stump, same tree.  
**[0:53:57-0:54:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:53:57):**  Other species, hybrid poplar is a big one.  
**[0:54:00-0:54:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:54:00):**  There's a lot less, I don't know if there's less demand.  
**[0:54:04-0:54:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:54:04):**  What I'll say is that given the vast natural regeneration and planted conifer forests of  
**[0:54:13-0:54:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:54:13):**  places like Oregon and Maine and into Canada, the US has a huge supply of dimensional lumber,  
**[0:54:22-0:54:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:54:22):**  of standard wood that you'd get at a big box store.  
**[0:54:26-0:54:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:54:26):**  And in comparison to Europe, which has much less natural forest, it makes less sense to  
**[0:54:34-0:54:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:54:34):**  grow that we'll say entry level wood in plantation in the US.  
**[0:54:39-0:54:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:54:39):**  There are exceptions to that if you mill it yourself and you're creating a retail product.  
**[0:54:45-0:54:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:54:45):**  But if you're looking at say selling hybrid poplar or selling pine, then, see maybe if  
**[0:54:52-0:54:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:54:52):**  you're thinning your windbreak, it's worthwhile, but you're not going to have positive IRRs,  
**[0:54:59-0:55:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:54:59):**  returns from that at least with current lumber prices.  
**[0:55:02-0:55:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:55:02):**  Okay, so that's fascinating to hear about that type of configuration within lumber.  
**[0:55:07-0:55:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:55:07):**  And much like you've been touching on through all of the different configurations we've  
**[0:55:12-0:55:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:55:12):**  been talking about, the access to market is really what's going to determine the profitability  
**[0:55:17-0:55:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:55:17):**  over any period of time.  
**[0:55:19-0:55:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:55:19):**  And I'm wondering how not only do you look at the different types of markets that are  
**[0:55:26-0:55:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:55:26):**  available to access, but in some cases, especially if it's more of a niche product, you're looking  
**[0:55:31-0:55:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:55:31):**  at having to actually create a market for it.  
**[0:55:34-0:55:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:55:34):**  What does that look like?  
**[0:55:36-0:55:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:55:36):**  So it starts with, it's really, it's the classic market creation initiative, hustle, whatever  
**[0:55:45-0:55:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:55:45):**  you want to call it, where you have to go out, find buyers, find where what you're producing  
**[0:55:53-0:56:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:55:53):**  creates value for someone else, kind of derive what they're willing to pay for a certain  
**[0:56:01-0:56:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:56:01):**  amount of value add relative to say what a commodity market might be willing to pay.  
**[0:56:06-0:56:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:56:06):**  And then compare that with what it costs you to produce it.  
**[0:56:10-0:56:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:56:10):**  So it's different buyers have different preferences, especially with new products.  
**[0:56:17-0:56:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:56:17):**  So like with fruit, breweries, wineries are great places to start.  
**[0:56:23-0:56:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:56:23):**  And then, yeah, the options are kind of infinite with wood, whether you want to make furniture,  
**[0:56:29-0:56:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:56:29):**  if you're a carpenter or sell lumber.  
**[0:56:32-0:56:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:56:32):**  Yeah, there are a whole lot of combinations and permutations there.  
**[0:56:37-0:56:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:56:37):**  And given that a lot of these configurations of enterprises that you're talking about are  
**[0:56:43-0:56:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:56:43):**  pretty new, even in the agroforestry space, the ones that have existed tended to be much  
**[0:56:48-0:56:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:56:48):**  more monoculture derived.  
**[0:56:50-0:56:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:56:50):**  And it's still a small percentage of agriculture, especially in the United States, but also  
**[0:56:55-0:56:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:56:55):**  through a lot of the world.  
**[0:56:57-0:57:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:56:57):**  Have you identified some niches in the market where the technology just hasn't gotten good  
**[0:57:03-0:57:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:57:03):**  enough or there needs to be some innovations to unlock the potential of certain configurations  
**[0:57:10-0:57:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:57:10):**  or plantings?  
**[0:57:11-0:57:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:57:11):**  Yeah, I would say that the genetic feedback loop with tree breeding is really slow.  
**[0:57:19-0:57:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:57:19):**  So with chestnuts, the one of the larger, I'd say two of the larger orchards in the  
**[0:57:25-0:57:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:57:25):**  US were planted in the 70s and the 80s into the 90s.  
**[0:57:30-0:57:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:57:30):**  And if you planted seeds from those trees, those genetics would be from the trees that  
**[0:57:36-0:57:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:57:36):**  were planted in the 50s.  
**[0:57:39-0:57:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:57:39):**  So you have these long cycles.  
**[0:57:42-0:57:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:57:42):**  So the University of Missouri Nut Breeding Initiative is doing great things on that front.  
**[0:57:47-0:57:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:57:47):**  Timber breeding is really similar.  
**[0:57:51-0:57:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:57:51):**  Breeding say locust and selecting for it to be fast growing, straight, looks like a flag  
**[0:57:56-0:57:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:57:56):**  pole instead of looking like a snake.  
**[0:57:59-0:58:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:57:59):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:58:00-0:58:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:58:00):**  And looking at these things right now to black locust is one of the things that grows most  
**[0:58:05-0:58:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:58:05):**  in the property that I'm moving to.  
**[0:58:07-0:58:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:58:07):**  And I've also been in touch with forestry nurseries around here that do have improved  
**[0:58:14-0:58:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:58:14):**  varieties of everything from pine nuts to walnut for various, you know, whether you're  
**[0:58:20-0:58:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:58:20):**  looking for fruit, whether you're looking for timber, and the upfront cost of those  
**[0:58:25-0:58:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:58:25):**  improved varieties is significantly different.  
**[0:58:28-0:58:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:58:28):**  And that's also somewhat of an impediment to jumping right in and investing in something  
**[0:58:34-0:58:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:58:34):**  like that.  
**[0:58:35-0:58:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:58:35):**  Is it, do you think feasible to try and go with a lower cost?  
**[0:58:40-0:58:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:58:40):**  And you know, maybe just assuming that lower percentage of what you're planting is going  
**[0:58:45-0:58:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:58:45):**  to get you the highest value, especially in the case of timber, right?  
**[0:58:50-0:58:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:58:50):**  Or when it comes to fruiting, these ones are going to be, you know, a little bit lower,  
**[0:58:55-0:58:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:58:55):**  but it's counteracted by the lower price for initial investment.  
**[0:58:59-0:59:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:58:59):**  How have you seen that work out?  
**[0:59:01-0:59:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:59:01):**  Yeah, it's a good question.  
**[0:59:04-0:59:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:59:04):**  With timber especially, you can buy these conservation grade seedlings for very little  
**[0:59:09-0:59:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:59:09):**  money.  
**[0:59:10-0:59:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:59:10):**  And then as you said, the improved stuff is more expensive.  
**[0:59:13-0:59:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:59:13):**  What folks will do is just plant more of the conservation grade species and then thin them  
**[0:59:18-0:59:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:59:18):**  out.  
**[0:59:19-0:59:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:59:19):**  So you might have a 12 by 20 foot spacing, you might have them at 20 by three or six  
**[0:59:25-0:59:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:59:25):**  foot spacing, and then have a certain percentage that you assume that you're just going to  
**[0:59:29-0:59:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:59:29):**  take the loppers and the chainsaw and cut them out.  
**[0:59:32-0:59:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:59:32):**  And then say thin your fence posts, then your small diameter round wood, and then before,  
**[0:59:38-0:59:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:59:38):**  not before, but then say you're 20, you have saw logs.  
**[0:59:42-0:59:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:59:42):**  So that's one way to do it.  
**[0:59:43-0:59:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:59:43):**  Or you can just plant all of the improved stuff, but the availability of the improved  
**[0:59:47-0:59:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:59:47):**  is harder to access, it's possible, but yeah, as a smaller producer.  
**[0:59:54-1:00:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=0:59:54):**  There are large forestry corporations, companies that take significant amounts of capital and  
**[1:00:01-1:00:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:00:01):**  time to get the genetics right before they plant large plantations.  
**[1:00:05-1:00:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:00:05):**  Sure, sure.  
**[1:00:07-1:00:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:00:07):**  Now you've really got your finger on the pulse of this industry and the way that it's advancing.  
**[1:00:11-1:00:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:00:11):**  I know you're talking about going out to another conference in Sardinia this upcoming year,  
**[1:00:17-1:00:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:00:17):**  and Europe has really been on the forefront of this for a long time because there's so  
**[1:00:21-1:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:00:21):**  much agroforestry traditions in the history of this continent.  
**[1:00:25-1:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:00:25):**  I'm wondering where you're seeing some of the most exciting innovations in this area  
**[1:00:29-1:00:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:00:29):**  come up that are showing promise and that you advise other people to keep an eye on  
**[1:00:34-1:00:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:00:34):**  as well.  
**[1:00:37-1:00:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:00:37):**  That's a fun question.  
**[1:00:39-1:00:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:00:39):**  I think what's most exciting, at least visually and ecologically, are the intensive silvopasture  
**[1:00:48-1:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:00:48):**  systems of South America.  
**[1:00:50-1:00:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:00:50):**  So you know how fast a tropical forest grows, right?  
**[1:00:54-1:00:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:00:54):**  It just takes over.  
**[1:00:56-1:00:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:00:56):**  And especially the faster growing species do that.  
**[1:00:58-1:01:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:00:58):**  So you have these folks in Colombia, Paraguay, I don't know about Venezuela, but a whole  
**[1:01:07-1:01:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:01:07):**  lot of systems in Mexico.  
**[1:01:11-1:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:01:11):**  Colombia, there's a professor named Enrique Murritio who has pioneered a lot of this with  
**[1:01:20-1:01:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:01:20):**  a number of other folks where you have say cattle under shade of timber trees to get  
**[1:01:28-1:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:01:28):**  that shade value, and then you have the grass below.  
**[1:01:31-1:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:01:31):**  And then you have these fast growing shrubs that they eat as well, like Titonia, Diversifolia,  
**[1:01:37-1:01:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:01:37):**  which is also called Mexican sunflower.  
**[1:01:40-1:01:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:01:40):**  I think it's Diversifolia.  
**[1:01:41-1:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:01:41):**  There are a bunch of Titonia varieties, so perennial sunflower.  
**[1:01:44-1:01:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:01:44):**  Then you have Leucaena leucosephala, which is, I don't think it has a name in English.  
**[1:01:54-1:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:01:54):**  People just call it leucaena.  
**[1:01:55-1:01:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:01:55):**  That's big in Queensland and Northern Australia as well.  
**[1:01:58-1:02:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:01:58):**  So you're basically having this cattle system where you're converting the enthusiasm of  
**[1:02:08-1:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:02:08):**  an early successional tropical forest into beef.  
**[1:02:12-1:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:02:12):**  And in terms of animal protein per ton of carbon sequestered, I think that's extremely  
**[1:02:20-1:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:02:20):**  exciting and I would very much like to see that scaled up.  
**[1:02:24-1:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:02:24):**  Very cool.  
**[1:02:25-1:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:02:25):**  Yeah, I was going to ask some questions about the conversion with tree hay as that's becoming  
**[1:02:32-1:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:02:32):**  more and more widely known.  
**[1:02:33-1:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:02:33):**  I've spoken to growers even in Scotland who are specifically growing trees as a supplemental  
**[1:02:39-1:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:02:39):**  feed for livestock, but it just makes sense to have the entire thing integrated pasture,  
**[1:02:44-1:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:02:44):**  shade, biodiversity, supplemental feed for the cattle.  
**[1:02:49-1:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:02:49):**  And then of course in these areas where the forest grows so quickly, it just seems like  
**[1:02:54-1:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:02:54):**  a no brainer.  
**[1:02:56-1:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:02:56):**  Yeah it's definitely easier the further south you go.  
**[1:02:58-1:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:02:58):**  You see dairies that are really reliant in a good way on mulberry in Costa Rica.  
**[1:03:04-1:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:03:04):**  It's a big one.  
**[1:03:05-1:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:03:05):**  You see tree hay with willow and other species.  
**[1:03:09-1:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:03:09):**  It's in New Zealand.  
**[1:03:11-1:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:03:11):**  And then if you want a YouTube search, I think it's beef up your profitability with legumes.  
**[1:03:17-1:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:03:17):**  It's a video from Australia where great drone shots, great financial information on lukea  
**[1:03:24-1:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:03:24):**  and kina in their pastures out there.  
**[1:03:27-1:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:03:27):**  The tree roots go way deeper than the grass roots.  
**[1:03:29-1:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:03:29):**  So during periods of drought, you have green, not dry matter, but dry matter equivalent  
**[1:03:37-1:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:03:37):**  for the cattle to eat.  
**[1:03:38-1:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:03:38):**  Right.  
**[1:03:39-1:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:03:39):**  Yeah, it's the same reason why we're looking into mulberries around here because of the  
**[1:03:42-1:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/harry-greene-makes-the-case-for-profitable-investment-in-agroforestry/#t=1:03:42):**  drought resilience of that tree and just how much foliage it puts out.

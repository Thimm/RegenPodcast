**[0:09:41-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:09:41):**  of San Pablo da Laguna for ODIM, the organization for the development of the indigenous Maya

**[0:10:46-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:10:46):**  someone should think about as far as limitations of the material.  
**[0:10:51-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:10:51):**  Sure, well I was first drawn into bamboo by my neighbor who was building their house and  
**[0:11:01-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:11:01):**  they had a friend who lives on the coast here which is where most of the bamboo in Guatemala  
**[0:11:05-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:11:05):**  grows because we're in the highlands here and bamboo will grow here but there's just  
**[0:11:10-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:11:10):**  no plantations whereas down there the big farm owners have clogged a lot of bamboo because  
**[0:11:15-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:11:15):**  it really holds the water so it's got a lot of ecological benefits it really holds big  
**[0:11:20-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:11:20):**  water reserves and it grows a lot faster than wood so it's very good for sort of quick cheap  
**[0:11:29-0:11:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:11:29):**  farm structures which is why on Shad's farm you'll see so many bamboo roofs everywhere  
**[0:11:34-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:11:34):**  so those are really just some of the benefits of bamboo.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:11:38):**  Give me an example of a comparison of how fast it grows in comparison to wood.

**[0:11:46-0:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:11:46):**  Yeah so you can harvest the Guadua Brasileño which I think is Brazilian Guadua in English  
**[0:11:55-0:11:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:11:55):**  after is it four or five years?

**[0:12:30-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:12:30):**  the Brazilian ones, the Colombian ones and there's the Asper which is a beautiful large

**[0:19:02-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:19:02):**  It was like I just moved country or something.

**[0:19:19-0:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:19:19):**  too.

**[0:19:28-0:19:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:19:28):**  So, I mean, I think just as it gains in popularity and people realize all the different uses  
**[0:19:33-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:19:33):**  for it, it's starting to...

**[0:20:07-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:20:07):**  You can just search Pinterest for bundled bamboo and they do composite beams, great  
**[0:20:12-0:20:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:20:12):**  arches bundled together.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:20:14):**  And if you get it while it's green or if you heat it up, but it's easier while it's green,  
**[0:20:19-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:20:19):**  you could flex it and bundle it into these curved beams.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:20:22):**  So it's a very aesthetically pleasing and structurally strong as well.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:20:28):**  And that's actually a valid point to make because you're trying to bend wood is quite  
**[0:20:32-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:20:32):**  a hassle.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:20:33):**  You have to steam it or laminate it.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:20:38):**  And the beauty of bamboo is in its fiber length.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:20:44):**  I think they're around eight centimeters long, typical bamboo fiber in large bamboos anyway.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:20:50):**  And the woods, I think, is about one centimeter long.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:20:54):**  So it's about eight times longer.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:20:56):**  And that fiber length is one of the reasons why bamboo is so much more resistant seismically  
**[0:21:02-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:21:02):**  because it can flex a lot more.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:21:05):**  And the behavior when it breaks isn't catastrophic.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:21:12):**  It doesn't catastrophically break it.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:21:14):**  It will actually, it will crack and snap, but it'll actually still stay together.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:21:19):**  Whereas when you break wood, it's gone, it's separated and it'll fall down.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:21:25):**  Whereas bamboo, if some of the joins are held well together in a building, then it may flop  
**[0:21:30-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:21:30):**  around a bit more, but it will be a lot more resistant to earthquakes because of that.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:21:37):**  Nice.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:21:38):**  Now we've covered just about all of the good aspects of bamboo.

**[0:21:46-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:21:46):**  Let's talk about some of the considerations and the precautions that you need to take

**[0:21:51-0:21:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:21:51):**  Well, one of the hardest problems, the most intractable problems I've had here in Guatemala  
**[0:21:58-0:22:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:21:58):**  is woodworm or pollia as they call it here.

**[0:22:07-0:22:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:22:07):**  There's various different bugs that will bore into wood and bamboo here.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:22:14):**  And the borax treatments and actually borax and boric acid solutions that you, you can  
**[0:22:22-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:22:22):**  pressurize and push that into the bamboo, or you can soak it in sort of swimming pools,  
**[0:22:28-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:22:28):**  very long pools with this boric acid and boric solution.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:22:34):**  The quality of the treatment here has been very hard to guarantee.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:22:39):**  And we've had a lot of bamboo that has come and pretty soon after we start building with  
**[0:22:44-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:22:44):**  it starts getting woodworm.

**[0:22:52-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:22:52):**  just be one bamboo that didn't get properly treated because of poor quality control down

**[0:23:14-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:23:14):**  to use.

**[0:23:26-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:23:26):**  So that's been a particular problem and we've got a lot better.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:23:30):**  I've started insisting on higher quality and paying more and guarantees with my supplier,

**[0:24:48-0:24:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:24:48):**  There's waiting until a bamboo is at the right point in its growth cycle.

**[0:25:14-0:25:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:25:14):**  for high quality materials increases, which it is happening here on the lake.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:25:18):**  I've probably trained probably close to about 300 odd builders now how to work with bamboo  
**[0:25:24-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:25:24):**  and it's ongoing.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:25:26):**  And just this week I introduced three more people to working with bamboo and they picked  
**[0:25:31-0:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:25:31):**  it up like that.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:25:32):**  And it's great to have all the right tools now that we used to be hard to get.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:25:35):**  So there's all these tools and all this bamboo and all these clients saying we want bamboo.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:25:41):**  And there's just so much bamboo pouring into this, which is great because that means more  
**[0:25:45-0:25:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:25:45):**  bamboo is being planted down on the coast instead of fast growing trees that will damage  
**[0:25:52-0:25:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:25:52):**  the ecosystem that actually contribute to the ecosystem.  
**[0:25:55-0:26:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:25:55):**  And so that's one of the problems with bamboos and bugs.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:26:00):**  Another problem with it is that it's not as resistant to sun and rain as say some woods  
**[0:26:10-0:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:26:10):**  like cedar or cypress.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:26:12):**  And of course most wood doesn't like getting wet and getting too much sun on it either,  
**[0:26:18-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:26:18):**  but it's bamboo because it's a little bit softer and a little bit more vulnerable.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:26:23):**  You have to be really careful to keep it out of the sun and rain.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:26:28):**  And that limits how you can build with it.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:26:31):**  So you have to have longer eaves and you have to have slightly higher foundations.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:26:37):**  Keep it away from the damp and the sun and sunlight.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:26:41):**  And what's something you do to protect it against solar degradation?  
**[0:26:44-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:26:44):**  I use an oil that's made in Costa Rica.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:26:47):**  It's called Laropik Plus.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:26:50):**  And there's these Chinese missions that did extensive testing with this company to develop  
**[0:26:59-0:27:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:26:59):**  the best protection for the bamboo.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:27:04):**  And they had, they recommend one coat of Laropik Plus and then one coat of Larosur Transparente.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:27:12):**  And these are two products made by the same company.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:27:14):**  And I found that's worked really well.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:27:16):**  But you have to reapply it, especially in areas where of high exposure to sun and rain.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:27:22):**  Like in the yoga forest, the bamboo hotel, you can see on the very long balls, sporting  
**[0:27:29-0:27:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:27:29):**  core stories.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:27:30):**  And they're very exposed.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:27:33):**  Shad hasn't varnished them enough and needs to get on that.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:27:37):**  Not varnish, sorry, oil them.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:27:39):**  They really should have it every, even as much as eight months in areas of high exposure.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:27:44):**  So there is this ongoing maintenance cost.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:27:46):**  Nonetheless, that's the same with all buildings, with wooden building as well.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:27:50):**  If you don't look after it, it's going to fall apart.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:27:52):**  Some a little less than others, but there's maintenance costs to keeping up the quality  
**[0:27:56-0:27:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:27:56):**  of anything.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:27:57):**  I mean, be it a car or a building or even your clothing.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:28:02):**  So it shouldn't be a reason why people would be disincentivized to do it, but it is definitely  
**[0:28:06-0:28:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:28:06):**  worth knowing that with proper maintenance, you'll get a much longer lifespan out of your

**[0:28:15-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:28:15):**  So the long eaves helps it shade them and keep them out of the spatter from the raindrops.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:28:22):**  And there's a number of other things you can do.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:28:24):**  There's probably too detailed to go into here, but so that's one problem is it is vulnerable  
**[0:28:29-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:28:29):**  to the elements.

**[0:28:32-0:28:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:28:32):**  But if you do protect it, then it can last hundreds of years.

**[0:31:13-0:31:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:31:13):**  just like a straw will crush.

**[0:31:55-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:31:55):**  I feel lost a long time and I'll set the pollution I created that.

**[0:32:23-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:32:23):**  And a lot of people are doing the same thing, but with concrete.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:32:27):**  I don't like concrete so much in my bamboo because it draws in moisture.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:32:34):**  And that isn't so good for bamboo all the time.  
**[0:32:37-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:32:37):**  However, a lot of people a lot.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:32:39):**  I should maybe reconsider that and start trying experimenting with that.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:32:45):**  And possibly even with just lime and pumice might be enough possibly.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:32:50):**  You know, lime and sand, at least because pumice is a bit less less compressive.  
**[0:32:55-0:32:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:32:55):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:32:56-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:32:56):**  A crush.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:32:57):**  So I'd be interested to do some more experiments with that.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:33:01):**  Yeah, me too.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:33:02):**  And the cement to see if it can do it really does damage it over time.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:33:07):**  That's just more of a hunch of mine.

**[0:33:12-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:33:12):**  Nice.

**[0:33:17-0:33:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:33:17):**  It's definitely not the same as framing or carpentry as most people are accustomed to  
**[0:33:23-0:33:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:33:23):**  with dimensional lumber or lumber of any kind.

**[0:33:35-0:33:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:33:35):**  bamboo framing and timber framing?

**[0:33:39-0:33:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:33:39):**  I mean a lot of the same principles apply, but where it really differs is its shape because  
**[0:33:44-0:33:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:33:44):**  it's round.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:33:45):**  You can't really use it as a door jamb or a window frame.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:33:50):**  That's one of the beauties of timber framing is that you have a nice straight piece and  
**[0:33:55-0:33:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:33:55):**  you can just put a hinge on it.  
**[0:33:56-0:34:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:33:56):**  Whereas bamboo, you can't really do that very easily unless it's a very rustic hinge or  
**[0:34:02-0:34:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:34:02):**  door.

**[0:34:11-0:34:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:34:11):**  cost because you have to get, you're kind of trying to fit a square peg through a round  
**[0:34:17-0:34:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:34:17):**  hole.

**[0:34:26-0:34:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:34:26):**  have done similar adaptations all over the world and come up with their own solutions.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:34:32):**  One of my tricks, for example, with the two by four is to cut a V-shaped notch or groove  
**[0:34:37-0:34:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:34:37):**  out of one side of it.

**[0:34:44-0:34:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:34:44):**  on one point, it touches on two or three or even four points and makes a much more stable  
**[0:34:51-0:34:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:34:51):**  join between the two.  
**[0:34:52-0:34:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:34:52):**  And then I can just screw it in with some wood screws into the nodes, which have more  
**[0:34:57-0:35:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:34:57):**  meat in them than the internodes of thicker walls.

**[0:35:08-0:35:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:35:08):**  and everything.

**[0:35:16-0:35:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:35:16):**  The problem of how do you finish it because you end up with this very thin V-shaped notch.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:35:22):**  If you're exposing the bamboo and you're building the edge of the wall to it.

**[0:35:32-0:35:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:35:32):**  angle.

**[0:35:48-0:35:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:35:48):**  It's challenging to work with the round.

**[0:35:55-0:36:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:35:55):**  cutter saw, big six inch hole saws, the bi-metal ones, not the tungsten ones.

**[0:36:30-0:36:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:36:30):**  together.

**[0:36:34-0:36:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:36:34):**  The great thing is about that is that almost anywhere you go in the world, you've got these

**[0:36:49-0:36:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:36:49):**  I love going to the weld shop and just figuring out solutions to problems that we can't solve

**[0:37:12-0:37:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:37:12):**  supplied where they are.

**[0:37:26-0:37:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:37:26):**  For people like you and me, it's so much fun to go to those shops and figure out what we

**[0:41:31-0:41:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:41:31):**  months and I'm joined here now with my good friend and founder of Atitlan Organics, Shad  
**[0:41:36-0:41:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:41:36):**  Goodsy.

**[0:41:44-0:41:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:41:44):**  I really love your podcast and I actually had a great time doing that interview back  
**[0:41:47-0:41:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:41:47):**  in one of the earlier episodes.

**[0:41:54-0:41:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:41:54):**  and Abundant Edge.

**[0:42:04-0:42:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:42:04):**  In particular, though, the Intro to Permaculture course is just an amazing way for travelers,  
**[0:42:09-0:42:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:42:09):**  gardeners, architects, basically anyone to fully immerse themselves in this new paradigm  
**[0:42:15-0:42:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:42:15):**  of permaculture design.  
**[0:42:17-0:42:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:42:17):**  Honestly, you can't take this course and still see the world the same way afterward, man.  
**[0:42:22-0:42:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:42:22):**  Yeah, that's for sure.  
**[0:42:23-0:42:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:42:23):**  It's life changing.

**[0:42:29-0:42:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:42:29):**  we're going to be able to offer your natural building course immediately after every one

**[0:42:42-0:42:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:42:42):**  know of available anywhere.

**[0:42:49-0:42:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:42:49):**  they need to start their own regenerative project or just their own regenerative lifestyle.  
**[0:42:55-0:42:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:42:55):**  That's what I'm excited about, man.

**[0:43:09-0:43:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:43:09):**  site, which is of course right down the hill from your farm.

**[0:43:21-0:43:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:43:21):**  I mean, the site is going to serve as a demonstration farm for perennial and regenerative farming  
**[0:43:26-0:43:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-beauty-and-usefulness-of-bamboo-with-charlie-rendall-of-return-to-the-forest-044/#t=0:43:26):**  methods for years and years to come.

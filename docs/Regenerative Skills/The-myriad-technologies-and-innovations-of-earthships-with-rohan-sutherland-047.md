**[0:01:43-0:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:01:43):**  Alright welcome to another episode of the Abundant Edge podcast.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:01:46):**  Today I have a very knowledgeable and experienced guest from the world of natural building for  
**[0:01:51-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:01:51):**  you all.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:01:52):**  Rowan Ireland from Earthship Biotexture is here to talk about one of the most famous  
**[0:01:55-0:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:01:55):**  and recognizable icons of the natural building movement in the last 30 years.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:02:00):**  Of course I'm talking about Earthships.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:02:03):**  Rowan began in international social and environmental work before getting involved with Earthship  
**[0:02:07-0:02:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:02:07):**  Biotexture, after being inspired by their on the ground work around the world and the  
**[0:02:11-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:02:11):**  appropriate technology and design that they promoted.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:02:15):**  Rowan has some amazing stories to tell from his international work, but more than anything  
**[0:02:19-0:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:02:19):**  he goes into a great deal about the systems and techniques that Earthships exhibit and  
**[0:02:23-0:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:02:23):**  promote which facilitate off-grid, self-sustainable living and integration of their structures  
**[0:02:28-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:02:28):**  with the environment.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:02:29):**  In this interview we talk at length about indoor food production systems, water harvesting  
**[0:02:34-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:02:34):**  and reuse, and how Earthships can be improved and adapted further by using more natural  
**[0:02:39-0:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:02:39):**  materials.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:02:40):**  Rowan even talks about the catch-22 of self-sustainable living and how it can have a negative impact  
**[0:02:45-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:02:45):**  on community development and connection if not managed correctly.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:02:49):**  This is another very information dense interview, so get your notebooks ready and I'll hand  
**[0:02:53-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:02:53):**  things over to Rowan Sutherland.  
**[0:02:55-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:02:55):**  Hey Rowan, such a pleasure to have you today.  
**[0:02:58-0:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:02:58):**  Thanks for coming on the podcast.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:02:59):**  How are you doing?  
**[0:03:00-0:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:03:00):**  Thanks, Oliver.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:03:01):**  It's my pleasure.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:03:02):**  I'm doing pretty well.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:03:03):**  How are you?  
**[0:03:04-0:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:03:04):**  I'm doing really well.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:03:05):**  It's a gorgeous day here in Guatemala.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:03:06):**  I would imagine you've got pretty good weather there in California as well.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:03:09):**  We do.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:03:10):**  We just have those clouds of smoke which are, you know, covering the sky.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:03:13):**  But other than that, it's a nice day here in California.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:03:16):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:03:17):**  Not bad for December, huh?  
**[0:03:19-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:03:19):**  No, no, no.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:03:20):**  Pretty good.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:03:21):**  It's a change from Taos.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:03:22):**  We're here just for a month visiting.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:03:24):**  Oh yeah.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:03:25):**  I remember from when I lived there.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:03:26):**  It's probably pretty darn cold this time of year.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:03:28):**  It is, yeah.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:03:29):**  Cool.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:03:30):**  Well, how about we jump right into the questions and if you could start by telling us a little  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:03:34):**  bit about your own background and how you got started in natural building and eventually  
**[0:03:39-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:03:39):**  working with the Earthship community, that would get us started off.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:03:43):**  Yeah, I mean, for me, it's, I've always, I've had an international background, so I've kind  
**[0:03:48-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:03:48):**  of moved my whole life and every, at every stage I've pretty much done social and environmental  
**[0:03:56-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:03:56):**  work.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:03:58):**  It could have been on the side of my studies or even while I was working.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:04:02):**  I studied international relations and I started working with the UN and international organizations,  
**[0:04:09-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:04:09):**  mainly in the fields of adaptation to climate change, international development, and everything  
**[0:04:17-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:04:17):**  regarding cities and how to help them become greener and collaborate between themselves.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:04:25):**  So during my work in studies, I came upon permaculture, Earthship, biotech, and I studied  
**[0:04:32-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:04:32):**  all the theory behind it, but I was mainly a project manager in those fields that I was  
**[0:04:38-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:04:38):**  talking about.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:04:41):**  And then I came to Cameroon in Africa on a job with the UNDP, UN Development Program,  
**[0:04:51-0:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:04:51):**  and I was working on adaptation to climate change with the government there.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:04:55):**  And I came to the point where basically I wasn't feeling that my work was having a real  
**[0:05:02-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:05:02):**  impact in any way.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:05:06):**  So I decided to kind of get involved myself in the practical side.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:05:13):**  That's when I saw that Earthship Biotexture was having a project in Malawi, also in Africa,  
**[0:05:20-0:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:05:20):**  so I thought the transition would have been perfect, that the opportunity was kind of  
**[0:05:24-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:05:24):**  perfect and the timing as well.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:05:26):**  So that's how I started.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:05:29):**  And then just having had a good kind of experience with them and the people working for the company,  
**[0:05:38-0:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:05:38):**  I then decided to continue doing my academy, that's the kind of schooling session with  
**[0:05:45-0:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:05:45):**  them, on the first international academy session outside of Taos, New Mexico, which was in  
**[0:05:52-0:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:05:52):**  Ushuaia in Argentina.  
**[0:05:55-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:05:55):**  And I already helped them because I spoke Spanish, I already helped them translating  
**[0:06:00-0:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:06:00):**  a few things, that's how I was able to actually attend the session.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:06:05):**  And then after that, I continued working with them on international sessions as a translator,  
**[0:06:12-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:06:12):**  also helping with logistics and communication.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:06:18):**  Until they basically asked me to come to work in Taos, New Mexico, where I've been working  
**[0:06:23-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:06:23):**  for the past year and a half.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:06:25):**  I have had my own projects as well, and it actually all started with Cameroon again,  
**[0:06:33-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:06:33):**  with an orphanage that I met.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:06:35):**  I was working on the side of my work, as I was saying I didn't find it very interesting,  
**[0:06:39-0:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:06:39):**  I was working with communities and orphanages, etc.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:06:43):**  And there's one specific one that really kind of touched me, because it was such a beautiful  
**[0:06:52-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:06:52):**  endeavor, but at the same time, they were struggling so much.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:06:57):**  So I started helping them, I'm part of their NGO, I'm a member of the NGO, I'm on the board.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:07:03):**  But I tried helping them, for example, I like photography, so I was taking pictures, making  
**[0:07:09-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:07:09):**  calendars for them.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:07:10):**  But I always thought, you know, like, how is this going to work next year?  
**[0:07:14-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:07:14):**  How am I going to be able to help with, you know, the cost of nutrition, of education,  
**[0:07:21-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:07:21):**  of healthcare, etc.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:07:23):**  So that's when I really came up with this idea of the sustainable center, which would  
**[0:07:31-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:07:31):**  basically help with all the different aspects that they were struggling with.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:07:36):**  So they would be able to have a house, they would be able to have their own electricity,  
**[0:07:42-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:07:42):**  they would be able to have, you know, clean water that they can use, all the food that  
**[0:07:47-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:07:47):**  would be needed, and then different activities generating revenue, which would be incorporated  
**[0:07:54-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:07:54):**  within the center.  
**[0:07:55-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:07:55):**  So that happened.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:07:58):**  And then we also thought, okay, you know, with them talking with them, they also thought,  
**[0:08:02-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:08:02):**  it would be great if we could have a medical center, and a learning facility within the  
**[0:08:07-0:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:08:07):**  center too.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:08:08):**  So we decided to integrate that as well to have as much of a holistic aspect as possible.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:08:13):**  So basically, from that specific idea, I went on to travel and learn as much as I could  
**[0:08:21-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:08:21):**  in all of those fields.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:08:23):**  And during my travels, I already encountered people in need, mainly because of disasters.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:08:31):**  So in Valparaiso, I was there in 2014, they had a huge fire that devastated large portions  
**[0:08:38-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:08:38):**  of the town, especially the poorest areas.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:08:44):**  And I got together with people who had also done the airship Academy, who actually met  
**[0:08:49-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:08:49):**  in Ushuaia.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:08:51):**  And then also people who were, you know, like working in permaculture there, who I had also  
**[0:08:57-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:08:57):**  met and attended a few workshops with them.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:09:01):**  So we just started building houses for people.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:09:05):**  We started, you know, building botanical parks, food production areas, food forests that would  
**[0:09:12-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:09:12):**  also maybe help in the case of another fire.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:09:18):**  Because those we noticed that those species of plants which were endemic from the place  
**[0:09:23-0:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:09:23):**  resisted way better to fire than you know, the eucalyptus kind of forest that they had  
**[0:09:30-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:09:30):**  there.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:09:31):**  So I was working there in the north of Chile as well after they had a landslide.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:09:36):**  So starting to put into practice some of the things that I had learned beforehand.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:09:41):**  So I was already kind of trying out different aspects of sustainable construction, permaculture  
**[0:09:49-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:09:49):**  in general with the food production, just trying to empower people who were in very  
**[0:09:55-0:10:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:09:55):**  vulnerable positions, whether it is towards, you know, economically, and also towards natural  
**[0:10:03-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:10:03):**  kind of phenomena that can happen.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:10:06):**  And a lot of it is, you know, resulting from climate change in different ways.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:10:12):**  So a lot of that experience was actually done, you know, with very limited resources.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:10:19):**  So that's what I've gone to specialize into, is to work with natural materials, reclaim  
**[0:10:26-0:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:10:26):**  materials, anything that can be found locally, basically.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:10:30):**  And then without really having to spend any money, so a lot of it has to do also with  
**[0:10:38-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:10:38):**  how much effort you're willing to put in salvaging these materials, going to fetch them, speak  
**[0:10:44-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:10:44):**  to people to know if you can, you know, take these tires here, these pallets there, this  
**[0:10:50-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:10:50):**  straw here, etc, etc.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:10:52):**  So that's been one aspect.  
**[0:10:54-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:10:54):**  But then the side with earthship was mainly about the more luxurious kinds and the sustainable  
**[0:11:02-0:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:11:02):**  systems.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:11:03):**  So for me, what has been interesting in learning with earthship is to build a kind of quality  
**[0:11:09-0:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:11:09):**  house that most people who are used to living in a conventional house would be able to feel  
**[0:11:16-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:11:16):**  comfortable in, you know, they would be able to feel comfortable living in that kind of  
**[0:11:20-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:11:20):**  house, because they have all the amenities because they have all the utilities, even  
**[0:11:25-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:11:25):**  if it's on off grid.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:11:29):**  And I think that is important for us at this stage to be able to promote to get a lot of  
**[0:11:36-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:11:36):**  people interested in sustainable construction, because it still has a little bit of that  
**[0:11:42-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:11:42):**  edge, you know, is it does that mean I'm going to be going back into stone age?  
**[0:11:48-0:11:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:11:48):**  Does that mean I have to light myself with candles, etc.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:11:51):**  So I think what earthship has been able to achieve is important in that sense, to kind  
**[0:11:58-0:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:11:58):**  of bring sustainable construction to people who want to be able to have their washing  
**[0:12:06-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:12:06):**  machine inside the house, to people who I've seen many different kinds of ships, you know,  
**[0:12:11-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:12:11):**  people who have even a solar sauna inside the house, a swimming pool, etc.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:12:17):**  But all of this being able to be off grid.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:12:20):**  That's remarkable.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:12:21):**  Yeah, I completely agree with you that natural building specifically needs to kind of start  
**[0:12:26-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:12:26):**  to appeal to a bit more of an upscale market, not so much because they're the people who  
**[0:12:30-0:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:12:30):**  need the technology.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:12:32):**  Obviously they're the more resilient population in the case of disaster economic collapse.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:12:37):**  But because they tend to set the trends that everybody else tries to aspire to or to follow  
**[0:12:45-0:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:12:45):**  and they can kind of help to steer or at least accelerate the move towards not just sustainable  
**[0:12:53-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:12:53):**  building but design that actually creates regeneration in the ecosystem.  
**[0:12:57-0:12:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:12:57):**  I think that's really well said.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:12:59):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:13:00):**  So let's take a step back just for a second.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:13:04):**  And for the people who are unfamiliar with what an earthship is, can you explain the  
**[0:13:07-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:13:07):**  defining characteristics and how the movement got started?  
**[0:13:12-0:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:13:12):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:13:13):**  So maybe I'll just start with how it was started first and then going into all of the different  
**[0:13:19-0:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:13:19):**  principles which make an earthship.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:13:23):**  So it all started with an architect, kind of renegade architect called Michael Reynolds.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:13:29):**  He had a degree in architecture, but he found, as many of us do, that architecture is contributing  
**[0:13:37-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:13:37):**  more to the problems which surround us these days than to actual solutions.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:13:44):**  So he moved to Taos like a lot of people did around that time.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:13:51):**  It was at the beginning of the 70s.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:13:53):**  There was a lot of move with the hippie movement which went there.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:13:58):**  And he started experimenting, building with different materials.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:14:02):**  I think it's also important to mention that it was a moment where you had the first kind  
**[0:14:07-0:14:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:14:07):**  of UN talks of the limitations that we have towards growth, eternal growth, as is dictated  
**[0:14:19-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:14:19):**  by our economic system.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:14:21):**  And at the same time, we were seeing some of the negative externalities that were coming  
**[0:14:25-0:14:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:14:25):**  from our linear kind of production, like extraction, production, consumption, throwaway in the  
**[0:14:36-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:14:36):**  dump system.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:14:38):**  So taking into account that side, and at the same time, it was the moment where we had  
**[0:14:45-0:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:14:45):**  the oil crisis.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:14:48):**  And the oil crisis basically showed a lot of people who were taking a lot of what we  
**[0:14:53-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:14:53):**  have for granted that with a sudden shock, we can go from the price of gasoline, tripling,  
**[0:15:03-0:15:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:15:03):**  quadrupling even more.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:15:05):**  And also that our dependence towards oil is not necessarily just for transport.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:15:11):**  Everything that surrounds this lifestyle that we've taken for granted basically revolves  
**[0:15:17-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:15:17):**  around gasoline right now.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:15:20):**  So it was a moment where all of that had its own importance.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:15:27):**  And it's a moment where some pioneers were doing basically important work.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:15:32):**  And I do think that Michael Reynolds is one of them.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:15:37):**  And so he started experimenting, building houses with garbage.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:15:41):**  So his first houses were using cans, and he used them as bricks and built a house with  
**[0:15:48-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:15:48):**  that.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:15:49):**  And then it just went evolving into integrating other systems, not just building with natural  
**[0:15:56-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:15:56):**  recycled materials, but trying to incorporate renewable energy into the house.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:16:04):**  Thermal solar heating and cooling, harvesting rainwater, and basically stocking it in the  
**[0:16:11-0:16:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:16:11):**  house, and then later recycling it after its use.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:16:16):**  So it basically started with a kind of idea and impulse.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:16:21):**  And it's with time and it's with the people who've also come to work with earthship biotexture  
**[0:16:28-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:16:28):**  that a lot of the different concepts have evolved and taken the shape that they have  
**[0:16:32-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:16:32):**  now.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:16:33):**  So it has, earthships basically are what you would call an off-grid house.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:16:39):**  And they have six major principles.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:16:41):**  One is that you would build with natural recycled materials.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:16:44):**  One is that you have thermal solar heating and cooling, so you don't need any energy  
**[0:16:50-0:16:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:16:50):**  apart from the sun to heat or cool your house.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:16:53):**  And we can go into more detail on that later.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:16:56):**  Renewable energy, solar panels, wind turbines, micro hydro to power your house, and then  
**[0:17:05-0:17:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:17:05):**  batteries to stock this energy and use it whenever those natural phenomena are not available.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:17:12):**  So at night when the sun is not out and you just have a solar system, you have enough  
**[0:17:18-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:17:18):**  energy stocked inside your house to use, to be watching TV, to have your internet, to  
**[0:17:24-0:17:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:17:24):**  use your computer, etc.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:17:27):**  And then the water harvesting from the roof, it's basically taking an umbrella, just considering  
**[0:17:37-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:17:37):**  a typical house as having an umbrella over it.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:17:41):**  That's the roof over our heads.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:17:43):**  And that water kind of just, you know, flowing away and we want it to flow away.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:17:48):**  Inertia basically will reverse that and say all the water that falls from the sky, we  
**[0:17:53-0:17:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:17:53):**  will keep it and we'll be able to use it in different ways within the house.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:17:58):**  So depending on the simplicity of inertia, you will have, you know, pumps, filters, pressure  
**[0:18:06-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:18:06):**  tanks, etc., which will allow you to distribute the water within the house.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:18:13):**  And then you'll actually have different levels of filtration depending on the use.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:18:17):**  So the last use is the potable one where you will have, you know, an extra mesh to get  
**[0:18:22-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:18:22):**  rid of the small particles and then generally a ceramic filter, which, you know, the whole  
**[0:18:29-0:18:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:18:29):**  system is pressurized, goes through and then goes into the tap.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:18:34):**  And then we recycle the water so every time the water is being used inside the house,  
**[0:18:40-0:18:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:18:40):**  whether you're taking a shower, washing your hands, etc., this water will be directed towards  
**[0:18:46-0:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:18:46):**  bio cells, bio plants.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:18:49):**  So botanical cells where the water basically feeds these plants.  
**[0:18:55-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:18:55):**  It has some level of, let's say nutrition as well from whatever's gone into the water.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:19:02):**  And then once it has gone through the plants and you have, let's say, a conventional toilet  
**[0:19:09-0:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:19:09):**  that uses water inside your house, that water will be pumped from the bio cell into your  
**[0:19:15-0:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:19:15):**  toilet and then from there it's going to go in a septic tank and a conventional house  
**[0:19:20-0:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:19:20):**  basically through code only needs to have a septic tank and then go into a leach field.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:19:29):**  It will add another botanical cell or two after that.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:19:33):**  So basically the water that comes out of your septic tank after the anaerobic process has  
**[0:19:38-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:19:38):**  happened now goes and gets filtered through more plants before going into the leach field,  
**[0:19:45-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:19:45):**  which gives it something extra compared to conventional homes.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:19:49):**  And sorry, and the last one is growing food.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:19:52):**  So through these botanical cells and other methods that you can have inside, you basically,  
**[0:19:58-0:20:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:19:58):**  you can grow your food year round thanks to again this thermal solar principle because  
**[0:20:08-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:20:08):**  the houses that you'll generally see have a greenhouse which is facing the sun and this  
**[0:20:15-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:20:15):**  greenhouse actually creates a microclimate.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:20:18):**  So in somewhere like Taos, New Mexico, it's a desert.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:20:22):**  You have temperatures, you know, going as low as 30 degrees Fahrenheit in winter and  
**[0:20:27-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:20:27):**  going extremely high in the summer, you will be able to grow tropical fruits and vegetables  
**[0:20:34-0:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:20:34):**  inside your house just because you can create that climate within it.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:20:40):**  You know, the perspiration from the plants is actually going to create the right kind  
**[0:20:44-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:20:44):**  of humidity, the sun, the heat, etc.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:20:48):**  So those are the different principles.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:20:50):**  There's six of them.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:20:52):**  And so the ultimate goal is to have a house that does not need to be connected to any  
**[0:20:58-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:20:58):**  centralized grids, any utilities that use up, you know, fossil fuels and that can also  
**[0:21:07-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:21:07):**  be vulnerable in cases like we saw, you know, in Puerto Rico recently with a hurricane where  
**[0:21:16-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:21:16):**  actual grids can collapse and therefore if you live in such a house you can be resilient  
**[0:21:23-0:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:21:23):**  to such, you know, events.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:21:26):**  Yeah, those are all fantastic systems and probably the main things that I admire about  
**[0:21:32-0:21:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:21:32):**  the Earthship Biotextures systems is all of those support measures to create the necessities  
**[0:21:38-0:21:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:21:38):**  and even the luxuries for a resilient life there on site.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:21:44):**  Now I have to admit though that I've actually been a bit skeptical of Earthships in the  
**[0:21:47-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:21:47):**  past partly because of the amount of cement that they use in construction and also from  
**[0:21:52-0:21:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:21:52):**  what I know that they're still quite expensive to build even with volunteer labor.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:21:57):**  So my question is how have you worked to incorporate more natural building materials into the Earthships  
**[0:22:03-0:22:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:22:03):**  and also to lower the price of construction?  
**[0:22:06-0:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:22:06):**  Yeah, no, those are actually very important questions to keep in mind.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:22:11):**  So for me I had two sides.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:22:14):**  On one side I wanted to learn all these systems, how they worked exactly, how you could build  
**[0:22:21-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:22:21):**  them, but then the rest of my education which was, you know, going to permaculture centers,  
**[0:22:28-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:22:28):**  actually you know coming up with new ideas through disaster relief operations etc. and  
**[0:22:34-0:22:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:22:34):**  testing them out is to be able to come to an off-grid house that would be comfortable  
**[0:22:43-0:22:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:22:43):**  and give you everything that you need but having to spend the least amount of money  
**[0:22:48-0:22:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:22:48):**  and also as you pointed out correctly, least amount of effort because one of the building  
**[0:22:54-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:22:54):**  blocks of an Earthship is tires and it's pounding tires and if you have, you know, 70 volunteers  
**[0:23:01-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:23:01):**  that are working on building a house then, you know, that can work pretty quick but that's  
**[0:23:06-0:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:23:06):**  not, you know, the general position of many people in the world.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:23:13):**  And even, you know, having worked in places like South America and Africa, places where  
**[0:23:18-0:23:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:23:18):**  you would think that communities would come together and work together, that is not often  
**[0:23:23-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:23:23):**  the case especially if you come after disaster, everybody's, you know, thinking about themselves  
**[0:23:28-0:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:23:28):**  and how they're going to be dealing with it.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:23:31):**  So basically what I would say is all the cement that's used in Earthship is absolutely not  
**[0:23:37-0:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:23:37):**  necessary.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:23:38):**  I've, you know, made sure that I would learn all the techniques to build with Earth especially  
**[0:23:47-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:23:47):**  and then, you know, nowadays we're talking about hempcrete, aircrete etc.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:23:52):**  They all have and even, you know, tire bears and that kind of stuff, they all have positive  
**[0:23:59-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:23:59):**  attributes and then their own negative ones.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:24:01):**  So really what happens is you will have to choose the kind of materials that you're going  
**[0:24:07-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:24:07):**  to use for your house depending on where you are.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:24:11):**  You know, something like let's say aircrete might work very well in a tropical region  
**[0:24:17-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:24:17):**  because it actually insulates the inside of the house.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:24:23):**  Does it really work in a place where you have seismic activity, you know, earthquakes?  
**[0:24:29-0:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:24:29):**  We're not actually 100% sure yet.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:24:33):**  Tire bells are the same, they have a higher R value, you know, there's less thermal mass  
**[0:24:39-0:24:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:24:39):**  than a compacted tire with Earth.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:24:42):**  So there's all these different things to be taken into account.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:24:46):**  What I have just tried to do is to adapt my types of buildings really to the climate,  
**[0:24:56-0:25:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:24:56):**  geography of course, whatever resources are available there and then to keep those two  
**[0:25:02-0:25:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:25:02):**  things in mind as you were saying that are very important.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:25:05):**  To try and keep the cost to a minimum and to try and keep the effort also to a minimum  
**[0:25:10-0:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:25:10):**  and that the time of construction is short because that also influences people's perception  
**[0:25:21-0:25:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:25:21):**  and choice afterwards.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:25:23):**  And of course what is also very important is the aesthetic.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:25:28):**  The first thing that they look at is the aesthetic of the house.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:25:31):**  Does it look good?  
**[0:25:32-0:25:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:25:32):**  Does it not look good?  
**[0:25:33-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:25:33):**  That has a big, big impact on people's choice as well.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:25:37):**  So if we just take, let's say, a regular conventional earthship, we can take off, we can take out  
**[0:25:46-0:25:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:25:46):**  all the cement.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:25:49):**  One of the reasons why earthship chooses to use cement is that it's quicker to dry.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:25:56):**  So if they're going to build a school in Argentina soon, if you use cob, let's say, to fill in  
**[0:26:09-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:26:09):**  all the tires, it will take you a very long time to dry.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:26:14):**  But at the end of the day, it is a better material because it is able to breathe, it  
**[0:26:20-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:26:20):**  can regulate humidity and it actually purifies the air inside your house.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:26:25):**  But at the same time, I do understand what you're saying that sometimes the limitations  
**[0:26:30-0:26:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:26:30):**  of a build site require a material that either dries or sets or is a little bit more resilient  
**[0:26:36-0:26:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:26:36):**  for the application required.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:26:38):**  And if you're, like you said, maybe running a workshop or something and have volunteers  
**[0:26:42-0:26:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:26:42):**  or students there for a limited time, I can understand the application for that too.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:26:46):**  Exactly.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:26:47):**  I mean, the only problem is it is also used within towers for houses that take a lot longer  
**[0:26:53-0:26:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:26:53):**  to build, so that there's just some of it is not necessary.  
**[0:26:57-0:27:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:26:57):**  That's just simple.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:27:00):**  Then it's also, you know, like if you say that you're autonomous in terms of food with  
**[0:27:09-0:27:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:27:09):**  an earthship, it is not true.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:27:13):**  Earthship can provide you with a certain amount of food, but it's not going to provide you  
**[0:27:18-0:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:27:18):**  with all the food that you need.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:27:21):**  What I do like with the principle though is that you are irrigating all that food basically  
**[0:27:28-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:27:28):**  by taking a shower or by washing your hands.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:27:32):**  So I think that's the kind of good side of it is that, you know, all of the water that  
**[0:27:38-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:27:38):**  you're going to be using within your house is going to be used directly to feed your  
**[0:27:43-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:27:43):**  plants.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:27:44):**  So that's important.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:27:45):**  But it is important to say that an earthship is not going to provide you with all the food  
**[0:27:49-0:27:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:27:49):**  that you need.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:27:51):**  Then the other thing that you see too in the airship community is that a lot of people  
**[0:27:55-0:27:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:27:55):**  use propane to cook.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:27:59):**  Now we all know that fracking is having devastating effects socially and also on the environment.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:28:09):**  If you decide to use a toilet that uses water, then why not looking to a biodigester?  
**[0:28:17-0:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:28:17):**  The biodigester is your septic tank, but at the same time it is providing you with the  
**[0:28:24-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:28:24):**  gas that you need to cook your food.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:28:28):**  So I just think that you can minimize a lot of the expenses and at the same time you can  
**[0:28:38-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:28:38):**  push towards more autonomy in a way.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:28:42):**  There's a lot to be improved in that sense.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:28:44):**  But I think that's what we're all striving for regardless of the design style that we're  
**[0:28:49-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:28:49):**  pursuing.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:28:50):**  You know, anybody who's looking forward towards a sustainable regenerative future is always  
**[0:28:54-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:28:54):**  trying to push the boundaries of what their systems can provide for the inhabitants and  
**[0:28:59-0:29:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:28:59):**  for the community and the environment as a whole.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:29:03):**  Now let's go back for a second actually to what you said earlier.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:29:06):**  I know that earthships were designed initially for the high desert climate of northern New  
**[0:29:11-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:29:11):**  Mexico outside of Taos.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:29:13):**  But I've seen many of them being built around the world in very different environments.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:29:18):**  And in fact there's even a few around here where I live in Guatemala.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:29:21):**  So the question would be how can the basic design be altered in order to be appropriate  
**[0:29:26-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:29:26):**  for other climates and applications?  
**[0:29:28-0:29:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:29:28):**  Because I know earthships are very well known for having that sort of slanted south facing  
**[0:29:34-0:29:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:29:34):**  or sun facing solar gain side and being somewhat earth integrated with a large berm wall in  
**[0:29:41-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:29:41):**  the back.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:29:42):**  And I've seen those same elements being repeated all over the world and I'm wondering if they  
**[0:29:47-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:29:47):**  are appropriate in all different climates or if not how can they be amended?  
**[0:29:52-0:29:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:29:52):**  Yeah, I mean one of that's let's say let's go to the principle of thermal solar heating  
**[0:29:58-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:29:58):**  and cooling.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:30:00):**  So if we take let's say Taos as an example, very cold winters, very hot summers, which  
**[0:30:08-0:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:30:08):**  is something that we'll find you know on the extremes in the northern hemisphere and southern  
**[0:30:12-0:30:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:30:12):**  hemisphere.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:30:13):**  So we're not going to talk about let's say the tropics.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:30:16):**  So if you're in the northern hemisphere your house will be facing south, if you're in the  
**[0:30:20-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:30:20):**  southern hemisphere your house will be facing north.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:30:23):**  You want to face it towards the sun and you want as much solar gain as possible for different  
**[0:30:28-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:30:28):**  reasons.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:30:29):**  One is to get that sun inside your house in the winter and make sure that your walls,  
**[0:30:36-0:30:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:30:36):**  your floor and as much as possible you know the walls inside the house, not just the structural  
**[0:30:43-0:30:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:30:43):**  walls but the other ones are made of thermal mass.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:30:46):**  Thermal mass can be you know mud in different forms.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:30:50):**  It could be cob, adobe bricks, it could be burnt bricks, could be tiles on the floor,  
**[0:30:58-0:31:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:30:58):**  it can be those tires that we set up filled with earth, cement, stones, etc.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:31:06):**  If you take all of these materials they're called thermal mass because they are solids,  
**[0:31:14-0:31:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:31:14):**  let's say they have a very low vibration, they're as solid as possible.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:31:18):**  When the sun hits them the heat accumulates inside of them and is stored as a kind of  
**[0:31:24-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:31:24):**  heat battery.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:31:26):**  Once the let's say at night it gets cooler then basically the heat seeks out of this  
**[0:31:35-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:31:35):**  thermal mass and heats the inside of your building, the inside temperature of the air,  
**[0:31:40-0:31:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:31:40):**  etc.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:31:41):**  So this is what happens in that kind of environment.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:31:45):**  If we're looking at a tropical region then we actually want the least amount possible  
**[0:31:51-0:31:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:31:51):**  of solar, let's say rays entering the house or heating up the walls because that's going  
**[0:31:58-0:32:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:31:58):**  to heat the inside of the house which we don't want.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:32:01):**  So the other side of it, let's say in Taos, and this is like the latest development, is  
**[0:32:09-0:32:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:32:09):**  to have skylights in the highest point which is now the greenhouse if we take the global  
**[0:32:14-0:32:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:32:14):**  model or the simple survival.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:32:18):**  So the roof is sloped north and the greenhouse which is facing the sun is the highest point  
**[0:32:25-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:32:25):**  and there you put a greenhouse.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:32:27):**  We all know that the heat rises, it rises to the skylight and then goes outside.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:32:35):**  Where does the air come from to replace all that air that's gone?  
**[0:32:39-0:32:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:32:39):**  It comes from tubes which are put at the back of the house.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:32:43):**  As you said there's a berm, there's like a mount of earth which is there and you have  
**[0:32:49-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:32:49):**  these metal tubes that go underneath this berm.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:32:52):**  So the principle there is that while the hot air evacuates your house and the hotter it  
**[0:32:58-0:33:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:32:58):**  is actually the more air kind of evacuates, then air gets sucked in through those tubes  
**[0:33:05-0:33:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:33:05):**  and going through the earth it gets cooled down by the temperature of the earth which  
**[0:33:12-0:33:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:33:12):**  is relatively stable.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:33:16):**  It would be even more so if you actually put those tubes under the earth rather than just  
**[0:33:22-0:33:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:33:22):**  through the berm.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:33:26):**  That is when it's very hot in summer so that's a similar principle you can take to the tropics  
**[0:33:32-0:33:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:33:32):**  and instead of trying to get solar gain in winter you only concentrate on cooling inside  
**[0:33:39-0:33:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:33:39):**  your house.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:33:40):**  So you're going to make sure that you have enough light coming inside the house and that's  
**[0:33:44-0:33:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:33:44):**  why the use of bottles is also quite interesting in our ships.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:33:49):**  Usually it's taking glass bottles, it can also be plastic bottles, cut them in half,  
**[0:33:55-0:34:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:33:55):**  use the bottom part of them and you basically stick them together and have the light which  
**[0:34:01-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:34:01):**  is able to come through so it acts as a window in a sense but it won't let direct sunlight  
**[0:34:07-0:34:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:34:07):**  come in.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:34:08):**  So using as much of those as possible you can have light coming in.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:34:13):**  You can also have your skylight which is not going to let the actual sun rays come in but  
**[0:34:19-0:34:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:34:19):**  is going to let enough sunlight to seep through to light up the inside of your house.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:34:28):**  You just want to make sure that whatever walls are exposed to the sun are insulated so that  
**[0:34:33-0:34:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:34:33):**  the sun does not, the heat does not go to the inside and then with that system of the  
**[0:34:40-0:34:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:34:40):**  hot air being able to go out from the highest point and having ventilation tubes which bring  
**[0:34:47-0:34:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:34:47):**  cold air inside or even having vegetation in front of airways that come in, you will  
**[0:34:55-0:34:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:34:55):**  also be able to cool down the ambient air before it enters your house.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:34:59):**  So Earthship has these basic models which can be adapted depending on the climates of  
**[0:35:06-0:35:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:35:06):**  where you're situated.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:35:08):**  Fantastic, so now I know that you're also really passionate about using all these different  
**[0:35:13-0:35:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:35:13):**  appropriate technologies that you just talked about especially for in the context of disaster  
**[0:35:19-0:35:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:35:19):**  relief and response.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:35:21):**  Now how do you see these building methods and techniques as a better alternative to  
**[0:35:26-0:35:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:35:26):**  the heavily engineered rebuild operations in disaster zones that are designed to merely  
**[0:35:32-0:35:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:35:32):**  withstand the next, you know, earthquake or hurricane or flood or whatever it might be  
**[0:35:39-0:35:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:35:39):**  and yet don't really respond to the problem in the first place that things were designed  
**[0:35:46-0:35:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:35:46):**  basically as a barrier alone and not as a full living system?  
**[0:35:51-0:35:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:35:51):**  Yeah, I mean there's many different examples I could talk about in terms of the work that  
**[0:35:57-0:35:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:35:57):**  I've done so far.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:35:59):**  Right now for example being in California which is hit by these very intense fires,  
**[0:36:04-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:36:04):**  it's to think of a building which could withstand heavy fires while providing you with oxygen  
**[0:36:15-0:36:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:36:15):**  because that would be a huge problem in those moments.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:36:19):**  Also it is a region that has earthquakes so the house would have to be able to withstand.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:36:25):**  And you know if we're thinking about climate change and some of the deregulations and the  
**[0:36:29-0:36:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:36:29):**  extreme weather events that we're going to see in the future, I actually think that all  
**[0:36:34-0:36:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:36:34):**  houses should be anti-seismic in a way, built that way.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:36:40):**  That if you want to build your house make sure that it can withstand heavy winds, that  
**[0:36:48-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:36:48):**  fires can happen anywhere so as much as possible if you can try and make sure that it could  
**[0:36:54-0:36:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:36:54):**  resist any fires that would be great too.  
**[0:36:56-0:37:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:36:56):**  So for me it's to try and keep all these aspects in mind when building a house and at the same  
**[0:37:03-0:37:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:37:03):**  time it's thinking of having the least amount of a footprint as possible and actually being  
**[0:37:13-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:37:13):**  a positive externality even if you're taking what might be considered as garbage away from  
**[0:37:19-0:37:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:37:19):**  the environment.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:37:20):**  So somewhere like in Cameroon where we built the orphanage you actually see that plastic  
**[0:37:26-0:37:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:37:26):**  bottles are such a problem.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:37:28):**  So people just chuck them out as if they were you know like a banana peel in the jungle  
**[0:37:33-0:37:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:37:33):**  they just chuck them out everywhere.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:37:35):**  When you get the heavy rains the water goes towards the stream, takes all the bottles  
**[0:37:40-0:37:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:37:40):**  there and all the plastic bags etc.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:37:43):**  It actually blocks the waterways, it blocks the streams, blocks the rivers that overflow,  
**[0:37:50-0:37:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:37:50):**  create you know like problems for transport but also will go and flood latrines where  
**[0:37:57-0:38:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:37:57):**  you might have risks of disease like cholera or typhoid which then you know goes and enters  
**[0:38:03-0:38:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:38:03):**  people's houses or is outside where people might leave their food.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:38:07):**  So it's like from one simple problem in that case let's say a plastic bottle you have all  
**[0:38:12-0:38:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:38:12):**  these negative externalities coming through it.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:38:15):**  So what I saw in my work before is that we were trying to tell people don't cut these  
**[0:38:21-0:38:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:38:21):**  trees don't do this don't do that but not offering a solution, a viable solution for  
**[0:38:27-0:38:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:38:27):**  doing that.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:38:28):**  In the case of plastic bottles what we showed is you can build a house, you can use them  
**[0:38:33-0:38:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:38:33):**  as insulation, you can use them you know to actually cool down the air inside your house.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:38:39):**  So we're trying to show people that you can you know use this thing that you didn't see  
**[0:38:46-0:38:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:38:46):**  any value to that was creating problems now you can use it and it'll make your life actually  
**[0:38:54-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:38:54):**  more comfortable.  
**[0:38:56-0:39:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:38:56):**  So that's one thing also in South America when we were building you know after these  
**[0:39:00-0:39:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:39:00):**  fires we some of the houses were on a hill so what we would do is the recycling of the  
**[0:39:07-0:39:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:39:07):**  water would go into botanical cells and then suddenly seek into the ground where we had  
**[0:39:13-0:39:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:39:13):**  created terraces and would grow food and all around those terraces we would grow the trees  
**[0:39:19-0:39:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:39:19):**  that would be most resistant to fires.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:39:23):**  We would also test you know instead of pumps that require energy we would try hydraulic  
**[0:39:28-0:39:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:39:28):**  rams which only use pressure to be able to pump water uphill or other techniques to create  
**[0:39:36-0:39:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:39:36):**  energy which can be you know actually just using the earth itself soil and basically  
**[0:39:43-0:39:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:39:43):**  putting copper and sink next to each other connecting them in series and you actually  
**[0:39:49-0:39:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:39:49):**  create energy.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:39:50):**  So we made you know micro experiments where we created a green roof made it a fertile  
**[0:39:58-0:40:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:39:58):**  soil put those in there and then that was connected to lamps, LED lamps and you had  
**[0:40:05-0:40:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:40:05):**  constant light coming from the earth.  
**[0:40:08-0:40:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:40:08):**  So for me it's to think you know solar panels, batteries, all of these things also have a  
**[0:40:14-0:40:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:40:14):**  big carbon footprint by themselves so what can we use that we have all around us that  
**[0:40:21-0:40:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:40:21):**  is not necessarily just sustainable because that word has lost a lot of its sense but  
**[0:40:28-0:40:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:40:28):**  that is kind of self-sustaining something you do not have to go out again and repair  
**[0:40:34-0:40:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:40:34):**  your solar panel or buy another one.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:40:36):**  What can you have that you can just repair yourself and would be easy to do?  
**[0:40:42-0:40:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:40:42):**  Sure and to get rid of the industrial process out of these things that we need and use all  
**[0:40:47-0:40:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:40:47):**  the time.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:40:48):**  Sure but you know that's also an interesting aspect which is coming up now let's say with  
**[0:40:54-0:41:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:40:54):**  the fab labs or you know 3D printers and the open source you know technologies is that  
**[0:41:02-0:41:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:41:02):**  the industrial production can now be decentralized too.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:41:07):**  So if enough people get together and invest in a little bit of machinery let's say even  
**[0:41:14-0:41:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:41:14):**  to recycle plastics so you want to break them down into little bits, separate them by types  
**[0:41:20-0:41:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:41:20):**  of plastics and then you can create new objects by you know melting that plastic into a mold.  
**[0:41:29-0:41:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:41:29):**  You know if just a few people get together and build one of these you have your own recycling  
**[0:41:34-0:41:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:41:34):**  plant and you're creating new it could be products let's say that you might even want  
**[0:41:42-0:41:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:41:42):**  to sell.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:41:43):**  So for me it's a very interesting topic about that about how communities can now get together  
**[0:41:50-0:41:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:41:50):**  and actually take the production side into their own hands production and recycling at  
**[0:41:56-0:41:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:41:56):**  the same time.  
**[0:41:57-0:41:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:41:57):**  Yeah absolutely.  
**[0:41:59-0:42:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:41:59):**  So now we were talking about just before this interview I actually did a portion of my natural  
**[0:42:03-0:42:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:42:03):**  building internship in a community just down the road from you all but I actually missed  
**[0:42:08-0:42:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:42:08):**  the chance to come and visit your site.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:42:11):**  So can you talk a little bit about the community that cropped up there outside of Taos and  
**[0:42:15-0:42:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:42:15):**  the earthship community and sort of what its vision is moving forward.  
**[0:42:23-0:42:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:42:23):**  It's a bit of a strange one I mean if we take let's say the there's three big ship communities  
**[0:42:27-0:42:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:42:27):**  in Taos there's what we call the greater world which is the headquarters of Earthship Biotexture  
**[0:42:34-0:42:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:42:34):**  the company and also its NGO which you know has done some projects around the world and  
**[0:42:46-0:42:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:42:46):**  also the visitor center where tourists can come and get information about our ships and  
**[0:42:52-0:42:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:42:52):**  it also has nightly rentals where people can actually go and stay overnight in an airship.  
**[0:42:58-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:42:58):**  So that's the greater world.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:43:01):**  Then there's two other airship communities one is in the mountains one is further on  
**[0:43:05-0:43:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:43:05):**  the missa where they basically do not really welcome visitors.  
**[0:43:14-0:43:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:43:14):**  The greater world also it's kind of important to note that if you're going to go there please  
**[0:43:19-0:43:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:43:19):**  go to the visitor center please you know if you want to have a tour or see an airship  
**[0:43:25-0:43:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:43:25):**  please call beforehand and that can be organized.  
**[0:43:28-0:43:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:43:28):**  A lot of what we see is that people take it a little bit like a zoo you know they'll just  
**[0:43:34-0:43:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:43:34):**  drive by go up to a house take pictures through the window sometimes even entering the house  
**[0:43:41-0:43:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:43:41):**  and you know people living there are not too happy about it.  
**[0:43:48-0:43:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:43:48):**  So those are the means there's a visitor center and you can also stay inside an airship.  
**[0:43:52-0:44:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:43:52):**  I really would recommend you know if you want to discover ships to find a way to stay inside  
**[0:44:00-0:44:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:44:00):**  of one because there's nothing else that's going to give you that experience that feeling  
**[0:44:04-0:44:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:44:04):**  that knowledge that you can get from it.  
**[0:44:09-0:44:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:44:09):**  And the community itself it's important to say that it's not that the final vision of  
**[0:44:20-0:44:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:44:20):**  it has not been attained yet and interestingly enough airships you know create bubbles.  
**[0:44:29-0:44:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:44:29):**  I do often compare them to you know the mother's womb being inside of an airship you feel protected  
**[0:44:38-0:44:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:44:38):**  you feel in this bubble you do have you know pretty much everything that you need.  
**[0:44:45-0:44:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:44:45):**  You do also need to respect it certain things that you're going to do are going to be at  
**[0:44:49-0:44:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:44:49):**  a specific time of the day let's say whenever we want to wash our clothes we have to make  
**[0:44:54-0:45:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:44:54):**  sure that the sun's already out that there's enough of sun hours left to be able to do  
**[0:45:00-0:45:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:45:00):**  it and then dry afterwards etc.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:45:03):**  But it kind of puts you inside this bubble and I think in the airship community a lot  
**[0:45:10-0:45:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:45:10):**  of people living there actually you know complain that there's not enough of a community spirit.  
**[0:45:15-0:45:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:45:15):**  So there's not really a place where people can go get together there's not really you  
**[0:45:22-0:45:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:45:22):**  know a place where people can even you know do a little business or something like this  
**[0:45:28-0:45:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:45:28):**  which would be able to help them out.  
**[0:45:31-0:45:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:45:31):**  There isn't the food production so it's not it's not the same as a community in the sense  
**[0:45:37-0:45:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:45:37):**  of you know in the Permi world how we would see it as people having to work together people  
**[0:45:45-0:45:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:45:45):**  having to contribute some kind of rotational scheme for you know governance or activities  
**[0:45:54-0:45:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:45:54):**  etc.  
**[0:45:55-0:46:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:45:55):**  So it's it's it's yeah it seems like that's a sort of unforeseen side effect of having  
**[0:46:00-0:46:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:46:00):**  an entirely off-grid system is that you don't need help from outside and perhaps that's  
**[0:46:05-0:46:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:46:05):**  what's contributing to a lack of community ironically.  
**[0:46:09-0:46:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:46:09):**  Yeah I mean it is it is absolutely ironic I think I think some of it comes from society  
**[0:46:16-0:46:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:46:16):**  itself you know how how we are geared towards individualism and and also material acquisition  
**[0:46:25-0:46:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:46:25):**  I mean the thing is we were talking about before in its positive aspect airship is also  
**[0:46:31-0:46:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:46:31):**  geared that way it's to say that you can have anything you want inside your house.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:46:36):**  So basically when we plan the solar system we will look at you know what is it that I  
**[0:46:44-0:46:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:46:44):**  want to use inside my house how much am I going to use it do I want a TV do I want Wi-Fi  
**[0:46:49-0:46:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:46:49):**  do I want these lights these pumps this sauna whatever it is you know a little waterfall  
**[0:46:56-0:47:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:46:56):**  whatever you want how it's however excessive it might be you will calculate let's say the  
**[0:47:02-0:47:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:47:02):**  size of your solar system depending on on those needs I'm putting that in in hyphen  
**[0:47:10-0:47:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:47:10):**  but um but um yeah it's it's it's one of it's one of the aspects that you can see it  
**[0:47:19-0:47:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:47:19):**  is that the community itself can hardly be you know called a community in that sense  
**[0:47:26-0:47:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:47:26):**  it's more like a residential kind of area you could even look at it as a suburb and  
**[0:47:31-0:47:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:47:31):**  and and you know maybe in a way that's important you know for because we have huge problems  
**[0:47:38-0:47:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:47:38):**  in the suburbs in this country in the US and with with airship you don't necessarily need  
**[0:47:47-0:47:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:47:47):**  to build a new house if you know the principles and you know how they work then you can actually  
**[0:47:53-0:47:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:47:53):**  take an existing house and retrofit it and apply all the principles to that house and  
**[0:47:59-0:48:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:47:59):**  have these sustainable structures so I actually see it as really relevant for those kind of  
**[0:48:07-0:48:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:48:07):**  areas like suburbia for example.  
**[0:48:09-0:48:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:48:09):**  Yeah absolutely and you know I'm fascinated constantly too at least from the dis the design  
**[0:48:14-0:48:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:48:14):**  aspect of how do you facilitate functions like community gatherings and sort of help  
**[0:48:22-0:48:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:48:22):**  between neighbors and interactions within a community through the design of structures  
**[0:48:28-0:48:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:48:28):**  through the facilitation of the landscape and things like that and maybe you know that's  
**[0:48:33-0:48:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:48:33):**  one of the the aspects that could possibly be improved in the in those communities as  
**[0:48:37-0:48:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:48:37):**  well.  
**[0:48:39-0:48:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:48:39):**  Exactly and I mean those for anyone who who's listening to us you know and who's interested  
**[0:48:43-0:48:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:48:43):**  in creating a community those are the things a little bit like project management you know  
**[0:48:48-0:48:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:48:48):**  like disaster relief or whatever it is a lot of people don't put as much importance in  
**[0:48:56-0:49:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:48:56):**  the planning stage and one for a community it is to define exactly do we not want any  
**[0:49:05-0:49:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:49:05):**  rules if we want some rules what should they involve and how is this going to help improve  
**[0:49:13-0:49:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:49:13):**  this kind of community spirits.  
**[0:49:15-0:49:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:49:15):**  So it's very interesting I mean I like to examine different communities around the world  
**[0:49:20-0:49:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:49:20):**  to see what's working what's not and what might be the reasons for that.  
**[0:49:25-0:49:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:49:25):**  Fantastic well Rowan I could sit here and talk to you about these things all day but  
**[0:49:29-0:49:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:49:29):**  I know you need to get back to your work and such so before I let you go could you tell  
**[0:49:34-0:49:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:49:34):**  us how people can get in contact with you the Earthship Biotexture community and if  
**[0:49:38-0:49:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:49:38):**  there are any events or workshops that you have coming up in the near future.  
**[0:49:42-0:49:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:49:42):**  Sure so if you want to get in touch with Earthships I would I would suggest that you look on the  
**[0:49:48-0:49:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:49:48):**  website earthship.com and basically if you want to learn some of the some of the techniques  
**[0:49:57-0:50:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:49:57):**  etc there's two major schemes for that we already talked about you know being able to  
**[0:50:03-0:50:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:50:03):**  go and stay in one of the houses to rent it out or to have a quick visit with a visitor  
**[0:50:08-0:50:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:50:08):**  center but another aspect would be to do either the internship which is three which is three  
**[0:50:17-0:50:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:50:17):**  weeks long all you have to do is pay for your housing there's different prices depending  
**[0:50:24-0:50:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:50:24):**  on if you want a shared room or not and during those three weeks you're basically going to  
**[0:50:29-0:50:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:50:29):**  be working with the crew on whatever's going on so it's very hard to tell what it's going  
**[0:50:34-0:50:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:50:34):**  to be in advance but that's that's one possibility and that will be purely practical then the  
**[0:50:43-0:50:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:50:43):**  actual school what I've been working on and help to run for the past you know year and  
**[0:50:51-0:50:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:50:51):**  a half is the Earthship Academy and that also is on the website the Earthship Academy is  
**[0:50:57-0:51:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:50:57):**  four weeks long and it's divided between the theory which is going to take half of the  
**[0:51:02-0:51:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:51:02):**  time and the practical work and if you do it in Taos rather than you know on an international  
**[0:51:10-0:51:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:51:10):**  global session as they're called you'll be able to you know stay in the housing which  
**[0:51:15-0:51:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:51:15):**  will be an extra cost stay in the housing visit different ships in the community and  
**[0:51:24-0:51:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:51:24):**  also get labs which you know talk about maintenance how to build water organizing module how to  
**[0:51:33-0:51:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:51:33):**  you know set up some of the electrical system etc so that the cost of that is $2,500 it's  
**[0:51:43-0:51:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:51:43):**  not given to everyone they also do some help so in case you might have let's say a humanitarian  
**[0:51:56-0:52:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:51:56):**  or disaster relief project in mind and you would like to go there to learn about it or  
**[0:52:02-0:52:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:52:02):**  if you do not necessarily have the means to pay for it depending on your situation you  
**[0:52:07-0:52:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:52:07):**  can ask for a scholarship where you will not have to pay any fees I think it's important  
**[0:52:12-0:52:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:52:12):**  to mention that for the people who would be kind of you know put off by the price so yeah  
**[0:52:19-0:52:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:52:19):**  so those those are the two main ones and then if you you know also look on the on the Facebook  
**[0:52:27-0:52:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:52:27):**  page Earthship Biotexture any kind of field studies so sometimes sometimes there is humanitarian  
**[0:52:35-0:52:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:52:35):**  projects or disaster relief or general construction of private homes or schools or whatever those  
**[0:52:41-0:52:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:52:41):**  are being advertised and that can be a way also to participate some of these field studies  
**[0:52:47-0:52:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:52:47):**  especially when they're to build a private person's home can actually be free as well  
**[0:52:53-0:53:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:52:53):**  so I think that is that is something to look at and we also have this group on Facebook  
**[0:53:00-0:53:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:53:00):**  which we called Earthship Inspired Community and what we're going to be doing there is  
**[0:53:05-0:53:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:53:05):**  to have more of a kind of decentralized aspect of how people can work together and create  
**[0:53:16-0:53:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:53:16):**  their own projects and use other technologies other means of constructions which are not  
**[0:53:21-0:53:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:53:21):**  necessarily you know what is always used with Earthship and and therefore it being more  
**[0:53:29-0:53:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:53:29):**  kind of yeah decentralized in that sense.  
**[0:53:33-0:53:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:53:33):**  Fantastic. Thank you again so much for your time Rowan it's been a real pleasure talking  
**[0:53:38-0:53:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:53:38):**  to you I hope we can catch up again sometime soon and yeah let's let's stay in touch for  
**[0:53:44-0:53:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:53:44):**  sure.  
**[0:53:45-0:53:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:53:45):**  Yeah that would be a pleasure Oliver and thank you thank you so much for the good work you're  
**[0:53:48-0:53:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:53:48):**  doing we need we need to hear those voices so that's great thank you so much.  
**[0:53:52-0:53:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:53:52):**  I'm sure we can collaborate on something in the future we'll definitely stay in touch  
**[0:53:55-0:53:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:53:55):**  about that.  
**[0:53:57-0:54:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:53:57):**  So before we wrap up this show for the week I've got some exciting news about the upcoming  
**[0:54:01-0:54:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:54:01):**  months and I'm joined here now with my good friend and founder of Atitlán Organics Shad  
**[0:54:05-0:54:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:54:05):**  Goodsy.  
**[0:54:06-0:54:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:54:06):**  Hey buddy what's new?  
**[0:54:07-0:54:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:54:07):**  Oh man so much is happening.  
**[0:54:10-0:54:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:54:10):**  First off though I just want to say thanks for having me man I really love your podcast  
**[0:54:15-0:54:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:54:15):**  and I actually had a great time doing that interview back in one of the earlier episodes.  
**[0:54:19-0:54:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:54:19):**  Anyway probably what's most exciting is our new collaboration between Atitlán Organics  
**[0:54:24-0:54:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:54:24):**  and Abundant Edge.  
**[0:54:26-0:54:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:54:26):**  As you know we've been offering permaculture design courses for over six years now and  
**[0:54:30-0:54:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:54:30):**  they really have become a staple here in Lake Atitlán.  
**[0:54:33-0:54:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:54:33):**  In particular though the intro to permaculture course is just an amazing way for travelers,  
**[0:54:39-0:54:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:54:39):**  gardeners, architects, basically anyone to fully immerse themselves in this new paradigm  
**[0:54:45-0:54:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:54:45):**  of permaculture design.  
**[0:54:47-0:54:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:54:47):**  Like honestly you can't take this course and still see the world the same way afterward.  
**[0:54:52-0:54:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:54:52):**  Yeah that's for sure.  
**[0:54:53-0:54:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:54:53):**  Life changing.  
**[0:54:54-0:54:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:54:54):**  But like I said what I'm most excited about is that now thanks to our collaboration we're  
**[0:54:59-0:55:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:54:59):**  going to be able to offer your natural building course immediately after every one of our  
**[0:55:05-0:55:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:55:05):**  intro to permaculture courses.  
**[0:55:07-0:55:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:55:07):**  Literally this two week offering is like possibly the most complete package that I know of available  
**[0:55:13-0:55:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:55:13):**  anywhere.  
**[0:55:14-0:55:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:55:14):**  Basically with these two courses alone I think that someone should have everything they need  
**[0:55:19-0:55:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:55:19):**  to start their own regenerative project or just their own regenerative lifestyle.  
**[0:55:25-0:55:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:55:25):**  That's what I'm excited about man.  
**[0:55:26-0:55:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:55:26):**  But yeah what about you?  
**[0:55:28-0:55:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:55:28):**  What's going on?  
**[0:55:29-0:55:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:55:29):**  Man well you know already that me and the abundant edge team are gearing up for a big  
**[0:55:33-0:55:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:55:33):**  season as well.  
**[0:55:34-0:55:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:55:34):**  I mean starting in November we'll be breaking ground on a regenerative farming demonstration  
**[0:55:38-0:55:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:55:38):**  site which is of course right down the hill from your farm.  
**[0:55:42-0:55:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:55:42):**  We'll be building animal pens, a classroom, outdoor kitchens and lounge areas connected  
**[0:55:47-0:55:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:55:47):**  to houses and it's all going to be made out of natural materials.  
**[0:55:51-0:55:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:55:51):**  I mean the site is going to serve as a demonstration farm for perennial and regenerative farming  
**[0:55:56-0:56:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:55:56):**  methods for years and years to come and we'll even be offering courses and internship opportunities  
**[0:56:01-0:56:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:56:01):**  to people who want to learn for themselves about how to build with natural materials  
**[0:56:05-0:56:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:56:05):**  and set up their own farms.  
**[0:56:07-0:56:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:56:07):**  Heck yeah!  
**[0:56:08-0:56:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:56:08):**  That sounds amazing man.  
**[0:56:10-0:56:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:56:10):**  And honestly this is just about the best place in the world to learn all these things too.  
**[0:56:14-0:56:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:56:14):**  I mean this little town is Sununah in the gorgeous tropical mountains of Guatemala like  
**[0:56:19-0:56:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:56:19):**  right here on the shores of Lake Atitlan.  
**[0:56:21-0:56:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:56:21):**  It's one of the most beautiful places in the world.  
**[0:56:24-0:56:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:56:24):**  On top of that you have this traditional indigenous Mayan culture that's still rich and alive  
**[0:56:29-0:56:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:56:29):**  and probably my favorite part is that we have this world international community of alternative  
**[0:56:35-0:56:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:56:35):**  people that are open to new ideas and really putting things into practice.  
**[0:56:39-0:56:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:56:39):**  I mean within walking distance of the bamboo guest house you've got loads of things going  
**[0:56:44-0:56:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:56:44):**  on.  
**[0:56:45-0:56:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:56:45):**  We've got the projects that we've already talked about but you also have yoga retreat  
**[0:56:48-0:56:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:56:48):**  centers.  
**[0:56:49-0:56:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:56:49):**  You have Charlie Rendell's natural bamboo building school.  
**[0:56:52-0:56:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:56:52):**  You have Love Probiotics.  
**[0:56:53-0:57:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:56:53):**  You've got Fungi Academy and honestly loads more alternative blow your mind type stuff.  
**[0:57:00-0:57:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:57:00):**  I honestly just feel like this is where it's all happening.  
**[0:57:02-0:57:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:57:02):**  Yeah man it really does and I want to get as many people as possible in on these projects  
**[0:57:07-0:57:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:57:07):**  but we've got to make sure that they've got the skills first.  
**[0:57:10-0:57:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:57:10):**  So what do you say?  
**[0:57:11-0:57:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:57:11):**  Let's offer a big discount to those who sign up for both courses.  
**[0:57:14-0:57:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:57:14):**  I mean all food and lodging and the amazing bamboo guest house is already included in  
**[0:57:18-0:57:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:57:18):**  the tuition so this will be like the best deal that we've ever offered.  
**[0:57:22-0:57:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:57:22):**  That's a great idea because I mean people can still take just one course if that's what  
**[0:57:26-0:57:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:57:26):**  they're into or if they can't make the full two weeks but this will actually make the  
**[0:57:30-0:57:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:57:30):**  two courses more accessible to even a wider audience of people.  
**[0:57:34-0:57:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:57:34):**  That way more people can get the knowledge that they need to get started doing what they  
**[0:57:38-0:57:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:57:38):**  want to do.  
**[0:57:40-0:57:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:57:40):**  So hey to all of you listening out there we really want passionate and driven people like  
**[0:57:44-0:57:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rohan-sutherland/#t=0:57:44):**  you to come and be a part of the community and the ecosystem that we're building out

**[0:01:04-0:01:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:01:04):**  Hey everybody, and welcome back!  
**[0:01:08-0:01:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:01:08):**  Now, in working in regenerative design for a while and being connected with many other  
**[0:01:12-0:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:01:12):**  people who make their living this way, myself and a lot of others have begun to identify  
**[0:01:16-0:01:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:01:16):**  patterns in the questions and troubles that people reach out to us consultants and designers  
**[0:01:21-0:01:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:01:21):**  for.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:01:22):**  Now, I haven't been in this line of work nearly as long as the team at Verge Permaculture,  
**[0:01:26-0:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:01:26):**  and so it felt really good to hear that many of the commonalities that they've seen from  
**[0:01:30-0:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:01:30):**  clients and students mirror my own experience.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:01:34):**  The truth is that Permaculture is a very broad design philosophy that can feel overwhelming,  
**[0:01:39-0:01:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:01:39):**  even with years of experience and especially at the beginning of a project, when you're  
**[0:01:43-0:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:01:43):**  still gathering information about your ecology and your context, and when you see so much  
**[0:01:47-0:01:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:01:47):**  potential in front of you.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:01:49):**  For this reason, it can be extremely helpful to have a guide that outlines a process that  
**[0:01:53-0:01:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:01:53):**  can illuminate and simplify the options available to you and cut through that overwhelm.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:01:59):**  Throughout this season, I'll be teaming up with the members of Verge Permaculture to  
**[0:02:03-0:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:02:03):**  show you the process that they've outlined in their new book, Building Your Permaculture  
**[0:02:07-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:02:07):**  Property.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:02:09):**  In five clear steps, their process can guide you through the minefield of choices and pitfalls  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:02:14):**  while designing your project and then implementing the design.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:02:19):**  Step zero is about inspecting your paradigm, and it'll give some context to the other steps.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:02:24):**  Step one is to clarify your vision, values, and resources.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:02:28):**  Step two is to diagnose your resources for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and  
**[0:02:33-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:02:33):**  threats.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:02:35):**  Step three is to design your resources to meet your vision and values.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:02:40):**  Step four is to implement the right design that will most improve your weakest resource.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:02:46):**  And step five is to monitor your resources for indicators of well-being or suffering.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:02:52):**  So in today's episode, I'll be speaking with Takoda Cohen of Cohen Farms in Alberta,  
**[0:02:57-0:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:02:57):**  Canada, about step zero and step one to start you on the process of design and implementation.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:03:04):**  Now for those of you who want to get ahead of the game faster than I can put these episodes  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:03:08):**  out and to learn from more than 15 of the biggest names in permaculture on how to transform  
**[0:03:13-0:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:03:13):**  your property, the authors, Takoda, Rob, and Michelle will be hosting their online summit  
**[0:03:18-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:03:18):**  for the release of the book from April 23rd through the 25th.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:03:23):**  The summit is completely free and you can register at my permacultureproperty.com.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:03:29):**  But anyway, so let's get started from the beginning.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:03:31):**  Takoda began our discussion by explaining the five common problems that he and the team  
**[0:03:35-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:03:35):**  at Verge repeatedly hear about, which then led to the five-step process in the book.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:03:41):**  So the very first thing we try to do is figure out where people are at on the spectrum of  
**[0:03:46-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:03:46):**  overwhelm when it comes to permaculture.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:03:48):**  And so what we found is that there's kind of five stages or five struggles that people  
**[0:03:53-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:03:53):**  go through when they're trying to put permaculture into practice.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:03:57):**  And so I'll try to ask questions to figure out which one of those stages they're at,  
**[0:04:02-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:04:02):**  because that'll help me to figure out, OK, how can I tailor my advice to get them out  
**[0:04:09-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:04:09):**  of that?  
**[0:04:10-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:04:10):**  So the five struggles are essentially, what do I do?  
**[0:04:15-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:04:15):**  If somebody is in this stage, they're kind of overwhelmed with all the different options.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:04:19):**  They're quite new to permaculture.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:04:22):**  And they're like, OK, do I do swales or key wine?  
**[0:04:25-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:04:25):**  Do I do a passasoil greenhouse or do I do hoop houses?  
**[0:04:28-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:04:28):**  They're asking really specific questions like that.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:04:31):**  And typically, the way that they're asking them lets me know that they really haven't  
**[0:04:36-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:04:36):**  done a lot of the background kind of context work.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:04:40):**  And then the second kind of problem or struggle is, where do I find?  
**[0:04:46-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:04:46):**  So it starts out with, what do I do?  
**[0:04:49-0:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:04:49):**  And it goes into, where do I find?  
**[0:04:50-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:04:50):**  And this is all about people trying to, they're looking for information.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:04:53):**  Hey, do you have any suggestions about which courses, which podcasts, which books I should  
**[0:04:57-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:04:57):**  read about these specific things?  
**[0:05:00-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:05:00):**  And then the third struggle is, how does it all connect?  
**[0:05:04-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:05:04):**  They've got a bit of context.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:05:05):**  They've done some research on the swales and the chickens and the forest gardens.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:05:11):**  And now they're starting to think about, permaculture is not about the individual elements.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:05:16):**  It's about how they all connect together.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:05:17):**  They've got that.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:05:18):**  And they're trying to do design work.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:05:20):**  But they're struggling with, how do I fit all these thousands of needs and yields relationships  
**[0:05:27-0:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:05:27):**  into some kind of a usable design?  
**[0:05:30-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:05:30):**  And then, so after, how does it all connect, it starts out with, okay, now where do I start?  
**[0:05:38-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:05:38):**  They feel like they've got a design, but they're struggling with prioritization, decision-making,  
**[0:05:47-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:05:47):**  and probably a little bit of worry about not wanting to paint themselves into a corner,  
**[0:05:51-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:05:51):**  because they probably made a few mistakes already, and they don't want to do that again.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:05:56):**  And then the fifth and final struggle is, when does it end?  
**[0:06:02-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:06:02):**  And they're essentially overwhelmed with all of this stuff.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:06:07):**  They've had some pretty bad failures, and they followed somebody else's recipes.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:06:10):**  It hasn't worked out.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:06:12):**  And so these five struggles, like what do I do?  
**[0:06:15-0:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:06:15):**  Where do I find?  
**[0:06:16-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:06:16):**  How does it all fit together?  
**[0:06:18-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:06:18):**  Where do I start?  
**[0:06:19-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:06:19):**  And when does it end?  
**[0:06:21-0:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:06:21):**  Those are essentially the five struggles that led to the five-step process that, and this  
**[0:06:26-0:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:06:26):**  kind of all happened organically as we were doing our education and consulting with our  
**[0:06:31-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:06:31):**  clients.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:06:33):**  We were trying to systematize and come up with a step-by-step process that was relatively  
**[0:06:38-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:06:38):**  easy to follow.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:06:41):**  But as a result of noticing all these patterns that people were struggling with, over the  
**[0:06:45-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:06:45):**  years, we kind of made the connections like, oh yeah, we were just doing this kind of organically  
**[0:06:49-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:06:49):**  that our process actually helps to solve these five kind of really common things that are  
**[0:06:54-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:06:54):**  tripping people up when they're trying to put permaculture into practice.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:06:58):**  One of the things that makes the design process easier is first understanding the concept  
**[0:07:03-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:07:03):**  of thought paradigms.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:07:05):**  Now Carol Sanford, who I had had on the show back in episode one of this season, speaks  
**[0:07:09-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:07:09):**  a lot about this concept.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:07:11):**  So I'll refer people back to her work for a really in-depth understanding of paradigms.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:07:16):**  But Dakota has also had his own journey through the different windows into seeing and interacting  
**[0:07:20-0:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:07:20):**  with the world, and he breaks them down in a way that's easy to grasp.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:07:25):**  With this understanding of frameworks for seeing the world, how can we use it to audit  
**[0:07:29-0:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:07:29):**  our own thinking to identify which paradigm we are using to make decisions from?  
**[0:07:34-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:07:34):**  One of the frameworks that I found really useful is something we call the three paradigms.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:07:39):**  It starts out in the degenerative paradigm, which is kind of where I see kind of Western  
**[0:07:44-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:07:44):**  civilization has been in a major sense for the past couple hundred years.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:07:49):**  And so within this paradigm, there's the idea that essentially humans are separate and above  
**[0:07:58-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:07:58):**  nature.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:08:00):**  And so this is based on things like extraction, control, and self-righteousness.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:08:08):**  We feel like we have the ability to do whatever we want.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:08:11):**  And so of course, we know where this paradigm is leading.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:08:14):**  It's leading to this destruction of our ecosystem, which will eventually lead to the destruction  
**[0:08:18-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:08:18):**  of ourselves.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:08:19):**  And so that paradigm is starting to come to an end, and a new paradigm is starting to  
**[0:08:23-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:08:23):**  emerge, which we refer to as the sustainable paradigm.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:08:27):**  So in this paradigm, we start to see humans as we're still separate from the natural world,  
**[0:08:35-0:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:08:35):**  but we're below it.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:08:37):**  Which for example, folks like Sir David Attenborough and a lot of other kind of environmentalists  
**[0:08:44-0:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:08:44):**  believe that planet earth would be better off if humans just went somewhere else.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:08:48):**  We are essentially inherently stupid, lazy, and immoral.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:08:52):**  Or from an evolutionary perspective, yes, we evolved, we are the end pinnacle of billions  
**[0:08:58-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:08:58):**  of years of evolution, but we still have all of the hang ups kind of from our chimp ancestors.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:09:06):**  We're separate, but we're actually less than the natural world.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:09:09):**  Both these paradigms end in the same destruction.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:09:14):**  In the degenerative paradigm, we destroy the earth and eventually we die because we can  
**[0:09:19-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:09:19):**  only live on this planet.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:09:20):**  In the single paradigm, we remove ourself from the ecosystem because we're bad.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:09:25):**  And so the only way to do less bad is to kill ourselves.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:09:29):**  I don't want to play those games.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:09:30):**  They're zero sum games.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:09:32):**  I want to play in the regenerative paradigm, which is this understanding that humans are  
**[0:09:38-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:09:38):**  not separate and above or below nature.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:09:41):**  We are nature.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:09:43):**  We have just as much of a right to be on this planet as any other organism.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:09:48):**  And just like any other organism, we can exceed the carrying capacity of our ecosystems.  
**[0:09:53-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:09:53):**  But we also, I think uniquely to my knowledge, have the ability to gather and connect seemingly  
**[0:10:04-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:10:04):**  disparate pieces of information and project into the future.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:10:09):**  As opposed to just the rabbit and coyote populations forever going through these boom and bust  
**[0:10:14-0:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:10:14):**  cycles opposite to each other, we can intelligently make ethical decisions about how we're going  
**[0:10:22-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:10:22):**  to live so that we don't have to go through those boom and bust cycles.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:10:26):**  And so the regenerative paradigm is based on this idea of interconnectedness and compassionate  
**[0:10:34-0:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:10:34):**  co-creation and all these different things.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:10:37):**  And so a really simple way to look at this is the degenerative paradigm is how do I get  
**[0:10:44-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:10:44):**  more goods?  
**[0:10:46-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:10:46):**  And then the sustainable paradigm is how do I do less bad?  
**[0:10:50-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:10:50):**  And then the regenerative paradigm is how do I do more good?  
**[0:10:53-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:10:53):**  Because when I give back to the ecosystem, I am the ecosystem.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:10:59):**  I'm just investing in myself in another format.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:11:02):**  One of the exercises we recommend in the book is that after you've created your vision and  
**[0:11:08-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:11:08):**  values one-pager, which is that's what we call basically once you've created these sentences  
**[0:11:15-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:11:15):**  for each of those eight forms of capital, that's what you want.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:11:22):**  And you've summarized them as these are the optimal expressions of all your forms of resources.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:11:27):**  And then you've also done some research into, okay, what is ethical?  
**[0:11:31-0:11:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:11:31):**  What is your sentence for describing what is right?  
**[0:11:34-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:11:34):**  And so for me, my sentence I've mentioned several times is what are the actions that  
**[0:11:41-0:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:11:41):**  benefit me, all other conscious creatures, and provide them all with the same opportunities  
**[0:11:46-0:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:11:46):**  are better into the future.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:11:47):**  Earth care, people care, future care.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:11:49):**  And it's like, that's it.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:11:50):**  So that seems deceptively simple.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:11:52):**  It has taken me hundreds of hours and many drafts to kind of condense it or clarify it  
**[0:11:56-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:11:56):**  down to this point.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:11:57):**  But once you've got that, and the purpose is that whole thing should fit on one piece  
**[0:12:02-0:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:12:02):**  of an 11 and a half by seven paper.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:12:08):**  And we call that your vision and values one-pager.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:12:10):**  And the reason we call it that is that one of the most common statements that our clients  
**[0:12:15-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:12:15):**  and students say when they're trying to build a permaculture property with somebody else  
**[0:12:19-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:12:19):**  is I just feel like my partner and I aren't on the same page.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:12:25):**  And so of course, well, the reason you're on the same page is because there isn't one.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:12:28):**  You've never actually taken the time to clarify what is it that you want and what is right.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:12:33):**  So now that you've got that one-pager and the kind of benchmark that I use to...  
**[0:12:40-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:12:40):**  Because it's constantly going to be changing and it's good because it's not the definition  
**[0:12:45-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:12:45):**  of what you want or what is right that's important.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:12:48):**  It's the defining.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:12:49):**  It's the act of going through it and using it.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:12:52):**  And so when you get to the point where you've got this one-pager down and you get goosebumps  
**[0:12:58-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:12:58):**  when you read it, or you start to tear up or whatever it is, or you have this feeling  
**[0:13:04-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:13:04):**  of euphoria, that's good enough.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:13:06):**  Stop there.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:13:07):**  And now let's try to use this kind of later to make decisions.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:13:12):**  Now, before we do that, if it doesn't give you goosebumps, one of the things that you  
**[0:13:18-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:13:18):**  can use to kind of see if you're coming at this from one of the kind of paradigms that  
**[0:13:25-0:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:13:25):**  is not optimal, the degenerative or the sustainable paradigm, is to go through each of those kind  
**[0:13:30-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:13:30):**  of sentences on your one-pager and ask yourself, is this coming from the degenerative paradigm  
**[0:13:36-0:13:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:13:36):**  or is this coming from the sustainable or the regenerative paradigm?  
**[0:13:40-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:13:40):**  And so this is like, is this based on the idea that I'm separate from the natural world  
**[0:13:48-0:13:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:13:48):**  and better than it or separate and worse than, or is it that I am nature?  
**[0:13:52-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:13:52):**  So a really good example of this, which was articulated beautifully by Penny Livingston  
**[0:13:57-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:13:57):**  Stark, who's another permaculture practitioner, is she took a statement that was actually  
**[0:14:03-0:14:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:14:03):**  in the Permaculture Designer's Manual, I believe, or maybe it was one of Bill Moulton's earlier  
**[0:14:08-0:14:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:14:08):**  quotes, he was defining what permaculture is, and he said, permaculture is a system  
**[0:14:13-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:14:13):**  of working with rather than against nature.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:14:16):**  And that sounds great.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:14:17):**  So that might be one of the statements that you put on your Vision and Values one-pager.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:14:21):**  The problem is that statement is coming from the sustainable paradigm because you're saying,  
**[0:14:25-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:14:25):**  well, I'm working with nature, but she's over here.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:14:29):**  But you could also say on your Vision and Values, my goal for say living capital is  
**[0:14:36-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:14:36):**  getting my natural ecosystems to work for me, which I'm pretty sure is actually one  
**[0:14:42-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:14:42):**  of the old kind of taglines of Monsanto or Bayer or something.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:14:44):**  It's like chemistry working for you.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:14:47):**  It's really based on this idea of extraction and control and dominance.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:14:50):**  That's the degenerative paradigm.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:14:52):**  And so the regenerative way to state this is, and this is what Penny Livingston Stark  
**[0:14:57-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:14:57):**  came up with, is that we are nature working.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:15:02):**  It's a subtle shift, but that gives me goosebumps every time I say that or I read that.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:15:07):**  And so going through each one of your Vision and Values sentences on your one-pager and  
**[0:15:16-0:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:15:16):**  asking that question, which paradigm am I writing this from, that can help to further  
**[0:15:22-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:15:22):**  clarify your Vision and Values.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:15:25):**  Now that you have a better understanding of the importance and auditing exercises for  
**[0:15:29-0:15:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:15:29):**  paradigm thinking, it's time to analyze the resources you personally have at your disposal  
**[0:15:35-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:15:35):**  so you know what you're working with as you make your design.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:15:38):**  Now I've mentioned the eight forms of capital many times in previous seasons on this show,  
**[0:15:43-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:15:43):**  and I reference them frequently when I'm teaching restoration design.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:15:46):**  But I love Dakota's personal story of how learning to see value in the often overlooked  
**[0:15:52-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:15:52):**  forms of capital has affected his own life.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:15:56):**  Growing up on a farm, we never had money.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:16:00):**  In fact, we've basically been below the poverty line my whole life.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:16:04):**  However, I feel like I'm one of the richest people in the world because we grow all of  
**[0:16:10-0:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:16:10):**  our own food.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:16:11):**  We have amazing houses, we have amazing families, we have all these.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:16:14):**  But I always felt, when I was comparing myself to my friends at school or things like that,  
**[0:16:19-0:16:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:16:19):**  that I was somehow less than them.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:16:24):**  And so when I first saw this framework of trying to understand what your resources are,  
**[0:16:29-0:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:16:29):**  I was like, oh man, of course, that's why I've always felt so rich.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:16:34):**  Because the money and things, which is what most people attribute to the phrase capital,  
**[0:16:42-0:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:16:42):**  those are actually means to an end.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:16:45):**  Nobody has ever gotten to their deathbed and wished, either dying wish, man, I wish I gained  
**[0:16:52-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:16:52):**  more money and had more stuff with me right now.  
**[0:16:56-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:16:56):**  Nobody's ever done that.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:16:57):**  Everybody in their deathbed that I'm aware of is always, I wish I spent more time with  
**[0:17:01-0:17:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:17:01):**  my family.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:17:03):**  I wish I spent more time giving back to my community.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:17:05):**  I wish I spent more time learning things or developing skills or experiential capital  
**[0:17:14-0:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:17:14):**  for myself.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:17:15):**  And so when this framework was introduced to me, it really helped to clarify my own  
**[0:17:22-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:17:22):**  kind of vision and values and resources.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:17:24):**  Because once you're clear about all that you have existing, and you frame it in terms of,  
**[0:17:30-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:17:30):**  which I'll go through them right now.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:17:32):**  So of course, there's financial capital, material capital, living capital, spiritual capital,  
**[0:17:39-0:17:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:17:39):**  social capital, experiential capital, intellectual capital, and cultural capital.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:17:45):**  And so when you just buy, I mean, for me, without even going any further into what those  
**[0:17:51-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:17:51):**  all are, just the fact that we've now kind of expanded our definition of what resources  
**[0:17:57-0:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:17:57):**  are, we've also expanded our definition of what has value, what's important to us.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:18:04):**  And so I think this is where, to my knowledge anyways, the unique piece that we added with  
**[0:18:11-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:18:11):**  our book to this Eight Forms of Capital framework is that that's also the same framework that  
**[0:18:16-0:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:18:16):**  we use for helping people to clarify what it is they want.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:18:21):**  And so this is kind of where the whole thing comes together is once you figure out what  
**[0:18:25-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:18:25):**  you have and you kind of create an inventory of all these different forms of capital and  
**[0:18:29-0:18:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:18:29):**  being really specific, at least for the first go around, I don't personally keep an active  
**[0:18:34-0:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:18:34):**  inventory of all these things.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:18:36):**  But when you go through and you list off, okay, what are all the relationships that  
**[0:18:42-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:18:42):**  I have that are really meaningful?  
**[0:18:44-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:18:44):**  What is my spiritual capital?  
**[0:18:45-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:18:45):**  What are all the skills that I've learned from my life up until this point?  
**[0:18:51-0:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:18:51):**  What's the intellectual capital?  
**[0:18:52-0:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:18:52):**  What's my IP that I've developed in terms of the courses or the content that I've created?  
**[0:18:58-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:18:58):**  And you actually create a list of all those things.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:19:02):**  None of my students or clients who've done this have ever come away with anything other  
**[0:19:07-0:19:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:19:07):**  than the feeling of, I had no idea how wealthy I was at the end of this.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:19:12):**  And so once you've got that inventory, then you kind of look at, okay, now this is what  
**[0:19:17-0:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:19:17):**  I want.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:19:18):**  And you try to come up with short sentences that are as clear as possible for each one  
**[0:19:25-0:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:19:25):**  of those eight forms of capital that describes, okay, this is my optimal expression of this  
**[0:19:32-0:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:19:32):**  particular resource, how I would like it to be.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:19:37):**  You write it in the present tense and you go through each of those eight things.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:19:41):**  So and then it kind of merges together and now you've got, okay, this is what I have,  
**[0:19:45-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:19:45):**  but this is what I want.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:19:46):**  And there's a gap between those two things.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:19:50):**  And then that greatly helps to inform, okay, what do I do to help bridge that gap?  
**[0:19:54-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:19:54):**  But of course then you've got that overlay of what is right.  
**[0:19:57-0:19:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:19:57):**  What's the ethical thing to do?  
**[0:19:58-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:19:58):**  Because we can't just go around stealing other people's resources and making them wrong.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:20:04):**  That's not ethical.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:20:05):**  And we also can't destroy the Earth's ecosystem because that's not ethical.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:20:12):**  And so having those three pieces, clarifying your vision, values and resources, it suddenly  
**[0:20:17-0:20:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:20:17):**  makes it much easier to figure out, okay, what do I do?  
**[0:20:21-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:20:21):**  I love this point that Dakota made here.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:20:23):**  And I would expand on it and say that even if a person has a skewed sense of morals or  
**[0:20:28-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:20:28):**  ethics, one of the powerful aspects of the eight forms of capital is that it forces you  
**[0:20:33-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:20:33):**  to see that stealing or extracting, let's say money or physical resources, causes you  
**[0:20:39-0:20:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:20:39):**  to degrade other forms of capital and throw your resource base off balance.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:20:44):**  Stealing from someone erodes your social and cultural capital.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:20:48):**  Hurting another life form or a resource base for your ecosystem damages living capital  
**[0:20:53-0:20:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:20:53):**  and is indicative of a lack of spiritual capital.  
**[0:20:57-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:20:57):**  In this framework, wealth is achieved through balance, rather than tipping the scale from  
**[0:21:01-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:21:01):**  one side to another.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:21:03):**  And universal values like sharing and cooperation is the only way to grow your wealth without  
**[0:21:08-0:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:21:08):**  degrading other facets of the whole.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:21:11):**  Dakota also points to an example of the Jeffersonian Bible to illustrate how people can investigate  
**[0:21:17-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:21:17):**  their own moral framework and selectively choose the advice and rules that are out there  
**[0:21:22-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:21:22):**  that serve their highest vision.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:21:24):**  This has powerful implications not only for your permaculture design, but for your whole  
**[0:21:29-0:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:21:29):**  life too.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:21:31):**  In terms of the Jeffersonian Bible, his process for coming up with his own code of what was  
**[0:21:36-0:21:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:21:36):**  right and what was wrong, he actually went through the Bible line by line and he cut  
**[0:21:42-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:21:42):**  out pieces that he didn't like with a razor blade and that he felt was either outdated  
**[0:21:52-0:21:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:21:52):**  or was just unnecessary or repetitive.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:21:56):**  And then he was able to clarify it down into, it was only a few hundred pages.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:22:01):**  So it went from, it's over six or 700 pages down to just a few hundred of what was really  
**[0:22:07-0:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:22:07):**  important to him.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:22:11):**  And so that's essentially what I encourage people to do is to review kind of all of the  
**[0:22:17-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:22:17):**  textbooks that whether it's fiction or nonfiction, whether they're, it's the Bible or the Quran,  
**[0:22:24-0:22:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:22:24):**  or it could be even books like Modern Day Philosophers, one of my favorites is a book  
**[0:22:31-0:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:22:31):**  called The Moral Landscape by Sam Harris.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:22:35):**  And so my recommendation is essentially go through these books that have really informed  
**[0:22:40-0:22:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:22:40):**  your understanding of ethics and morality and use this litmus test, basically have two  
**[0:22:47-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:22:47):**  colored highlighters in hand, a green one or a red one.  
**[0:22:51-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:22:51):**  And every kind of action or ethical framework that the author or the deity kind of proposes  
**[0:23:02-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:23:02):**  for you, you ask this question, okay, if I were to follow this word for word as it sits  
**[0:23:11-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:23:11):**  without any kind of interpretation and stuff, just as it is, if I were to follow this, would  
**[0:23:16-0:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:23:16):**  this idea or action lead towards basically a future of earth care, people care, future  
**[0:23:24-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:23:24):**  care?  
**[0:23:25-0:23:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:23:25):**  Is this action good for me, good for all others and would allow all of the conscious creatures  
**[0:23:32-0:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:23:32):**  the same opportunities or better into the future?  
**[0:23:35-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:23:35):**  And if it's a yes, mark it in green.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:23:37):**  And if that phrase or whatever is as meaningful to you, pull it out and use that to inform  
**[0:23:45-0:23:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:23:45):**  your kind of description or phrasing of what is ethical, what is right.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:23:53):**  And if it doesn't, then cross it out and move on just like Thomas Jefferson did.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:23:59):**  And there's a lot of other people that have kind of followed this same process.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:24:02):**  And so in this way, we can move past the dogma that is associated with any of these particular  
**[0:24:11-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:24:11):**  belief systems and we can truly come to a system of morality that everybody could agree  
**[0:24:19-0:24:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:24:19):**  on.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:24:20):**  As we move on through the considerations in this first step of the process, we've audited  
**[0:24:25-0:24:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:24:25):**  our thought paradigm, done an inventory of our resources through the eight forms of capital,  
**[0:24:30-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:24:30):**  clarified our values, and the main thing left is to clarify your vision.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:24:35):**  Now I'll let Tocoda explain how defining these three things can help to set a clear path  
**[0:24:40-0:24:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:24:40):**  by reducing the options that you have to consider.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:24:43):**  I think this is probably one of the most valuable parts of the book and one of my most valuable  
**[0:24:48-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:24:48):**  insights.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:24:50):**  And I'll start with kind of my, the way that I typically answer this if I'm face to face  
**[0:24:55-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:24:55):**  with somebody or if I'm in front of a chalkboard or I've got a piece of paper is when somebody  
**[0:25:00-0:25:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:25:00):**  asks a really specific question like, hey, should I do swales or key line?  
**[0:25:04-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:25:04):**  Should I do this or that?  
**[0:25:07-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:25:07):**  The answer is always, it depends.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:25:09):**  And everybody laughs and I get that.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:25:12):**  But then like, and a lot of people make that joke, but very few people I've seen kind of  
**[0:25:16-0:25:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:25:16):**  go through, okay, well, what does it depend upon?  
**[0:25:19-0:25:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:25:19):**  And so then my kind of thoughts on this is that it depends on three things.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:25:27):**  And the very first one is, well, what do you want?  
**[0:25:30-0:25:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:25:30):**  Like, what's your why?  
**[0:25:33-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:25:33):**  What's your vision for your property?  
**[0:25:36-0:25:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:25:36):**  The second one is what do you have?  
**[0:25:38-0:25:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:25:38):**  What are your existing resources that you have access to or that you own?  
**[0:25:42-0:25:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:25:42):**  And then the third piece is, is what is right?  
**[0:25:46-0:25:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:25:46):**  Of course, the ethical component.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:25:49):**  Once you're kind of clear on that, it acts like a Venn diagram where you, as opposed  
**[0:25:53-0:26:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:25:53):**  to having this kind of infinite array of options ahead of you, each one of those circles, when  
**[0:26:00-0:26:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:26:00):**  you clarify it, it cuts out everything except that what fits in that.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:26:03):**  So, okay, what is it that you actually want?  
**[0:26:05-0:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:26:05):**  Do you actually want to raise cattle and grow all your own food?  
**[0:26:08-0:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:26:08):**  Or are you more, do you want to go homesteading or do you want to go full on production farm?  
**[0:26:15-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:26:15):**  Is it more about educating people or is it about growing in self-sufficiency?  
**[0:26:21-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:26:21):**  Well now we only have to choose between a few of these options and then you overlay  
**[0:26:25-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:26:25):**  on top of the, okay, well, what do you already have?  
**[0:26:28-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:26:28):**  Is it realistic that you're going to build a $2 million teaching institute on your backyard  
**[0:26:34-0:26:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:26:34):**  in a suburban area?  
**[0:26:37-0:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:26:37):**  No, it's probably not.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:26:39):**  And so, okay, but everybody has a set of resources that is perfectly tailored to that person.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:26:48):**  And so one of my colleagues, Rob Aves, he often says this is that you don't do permaculture,  
**[0:26:55-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:26:55):**  you use permaculture in what you do.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:26:58):**  And so so many people come into this space and they have a background in software engineering  
**[0:27:03-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:27:03):**  or in residential construction or as early childhood development, whatever it is.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:27:10):**  And then they see permaculture and they get super excited and everybody wants to quit  
**[0:27:15-0:27:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:27:15):**  their job and start market gardening.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:27:18):**  And it's like, no, like you have to figure out what do you have and how do you leverage  
**[0:27:21-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:27:21):**  that towards what your vision is?  
**[0:27:24-0:27:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:27:24):**  And then of course the last piece that kind of cuts out everything else is what's ethical?  
**[0:27:28-0:27:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:27:28):**  What is actually right?  
**[0:27:30-0:27:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:27:30):**  And this is based on essentially the ethics of permaculture.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:27:34):**  I prefer the EarthCare, PeopleCare, FutureCare framework.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:27:40):**  And essentially this is, okay, what are the things that I can do that are good for me,  
**[0:27:45-0:27:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:27:45):**  good for the ecosystem and allow all future organisms, not just humans, all future organisms,  
**[0:27:52-0:27:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:27:52):**  the same opportunities are better into the future.  
**[0:27:56-0:27:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:27:56):**  And when you cut away everything else that doesn't fit into those Venn diagrams, you're  
**[0:27:59-0:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:27:59):**  left with at the center of those three circles, that's what you can do.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:28:04):**  And there might only be three or four options for any particular problem you're trying to  
**[0:28:08-0:28:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:28:08):**  solve.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:28:09):**  And that makes it so much easier.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:28:10):**  Now you're making decision based on three or four options as opposed to an infinite  
**[0:28:13-0:28:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:28:13):**  array.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:28:16):**  And there you have it.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:28:17):**  Though this is certainly a stripped down and simplified version of all the information  
**[0:28:21-0:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:28:21):**  on step one from the book, we've covered the main considerations in the first step in the  
**[0:28:26-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:28:26):**  process.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:28:27):**  So let's get a quick summary to help it sink in as well as a preview of what we'll be diving  
**[0:28:32-0:28:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:28:32):**  into as we explore the next four steps in upcoming episodes.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:28:37):**  So we've just figured, we've just come through the first step in the process, which is clarifying  
**[0:28:42-0:28:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:28:42):**  your vision and values and resources, because that's going to help you figure out what to  
**[0:28:45-0:28:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:28:45):**  do.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:28:46):**  The next step in terms of, you know, where do I find?  
**[0:28:50-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:28:50):**  This is a kind of a paradox here because the irony is that most people make the assumption  
**[0:28:57-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:28:57):**  that in order to get really good at permaculture, you have to memorize all this stuff, all this  
**[0:29:02-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:29:02):**  information, all these facts.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:29:05):**  And so step two in our process is actually all about organization as opposed to memorization.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:29:15):**  And so in that step, we provide a framework that helps you to diagnose your properties,  
**[0:29:20-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:29:20):**  strengths, weakness, opportunities, and threats.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:29:24):**  And so you could look at this as the clarifying your vision and values and resources.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:29:31):**  That's you, we've kind of been clarifying you, the diagnosis process now is about your  
**[0:29:35-0:29:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:29:35):**  property.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:29:37):**  And then once we've done both those, you know, step one, step two, the next step is, okay,  
**[0:29:41-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:29:41):**  well now how does it all connect together?  
**[0:29:43-0:29:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:29:43):**  This is now we're going to design your resources to meet your vision and values.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:29:49):**  That's step three, and that's going to help you overcome this struggle.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:29:51):**  How does it all connect together?  
**[0:29:53-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:29:53):**  And step four is we've got that struggle.  
**[0:29:57-0:29:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:29:57):**  Where do I start?  
**[0:29:58-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:29:58):**  And so in this step, we're going to be looking at, you know, how do we implement the right  
**[0:30:04-0:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:30:04):**  design in terms of, you know, what's the most efficient and effective use of our resources  
**[0:30:12-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:30:12):**  that's going to have the greatest thrust towards the wellbeing that we described in step one.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:30:19):**  That's also in alignment with our property and everything else.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:30:22):**  And then step five is all about, okay, how do we overcome this struggle of when does  
**[0:30:28-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:30:28):**  it end?  
**[0:30:29-0:30:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:30:29):**  This burnout, this ecological, economic, or emotional bankruptcy that is just so common  
**[0:30:35-0:30:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:30:35):**  in the permaculture space.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:30:37):**  And so that step is all about monitoring for what I call suffering and wellbeing as indicators  
**[0:30:44-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:30:44):**  and suffering and wellbeing in yourself and suffering and wellbeing in your ecosystem  
**[0:30:48-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:30:48):**  or you're kind of on your property to make sure that you're heading in the right direction  
**[0:30:54-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:30:54):**  as opposed to the wrong one.  
**[0:30:55-0:30:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/step-1-in-building-your-permaculture-property-with-verge-permaculture/#t=0:30:55):**  So this is all about monitoring.

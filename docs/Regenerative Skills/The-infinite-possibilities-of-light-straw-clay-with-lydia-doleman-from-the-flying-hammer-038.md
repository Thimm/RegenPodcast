**[0:00:05-0:00:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:00:05):**  permaculture, natural building, and regenerative living.  
**[0:00:08-0:00:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:00:08):**  As always, I'm your host, Oliver Gaucher, and I have a fantastic interview for you in  
**[0:00:12-0:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:00:12):**  this session, so stick around and we'll jump right on in.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:00:25):**  Before we get started this week, I'm proud to announce that Permaculture Magazine of  
**[0:00:28-0:00:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:00:28):**  North America has become the first sponsor of this podcast.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:00:32):**  Incidentally, they've also just celebrated their one year anniversary this summer.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:00:37):**  And as the offshoot of the beloved Permaculture Magazine International out of the UK, there  
**[0:00:42-0:00:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:00:42):**  is now a regional edition to help strengthen permaculture knowledge throughout North America.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:00:47):**  This is one of my favorite go-to resources for the latest information on innovation and  
**[0:00:52-0:00:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:00:52):**  news in the permaculture world.

**[0:01:23-0:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:01:23):**  go beyond sustainability.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:01:26):**  Have you ever felt completely bogged down by the weight of current events and news?  
**[0:01:30-0:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:01:30):**  Things like climate change, government corruption, war and violence seem to be the norm and hard  
**[0:01:34-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:01:34):**  to get away from.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:01:35):**  I know these things affect me deeply and that's why I'm always looking for positive news  
**[0:01:39-0:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:01:39):**  and media about solutions and inspiring change.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:01:44):**  That's why I'm proud to say that I've partnered with one of my favorite sources for just those  
**[0:01:47-0:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:01:47):**  things.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:01:48):**  New Society Publishers are book publishers that focus on putting out great books about  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:01:52):**  positive solutions for individuals and organizations seeking to change their lives so that they  
**[0:01:57-0:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:01:57):**  can go on to change the world for the better.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:02:00):**  What's more, their company mandate goes far beyond the single bottom line of profit.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:02:04):**  They actually care deeply not only about what they publish, but also about how they do business.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:02:09):**  They believe in the authors that they take on and the works that they bring to the marketplace.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:02:14):**  In fact the author that I'm interviewing today, Lydia Dolman, and her book, Light Straw Clay,  
**[0:02:19-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:02:19):**  are published by them and if you stay tuned at the end of the interview, I'll tell you  
**[0:02:22-0:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:02:22):**  how you can be eligible to win your own copy of Light Straw Clay.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:02:26):**  So stick around for that after the interview.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:02:29):**  From sustainable living to progressive parenting, New Society Publishers have the books that  
**[0:02:33-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:02:33):**  you need to help build a better world.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:02:36):**  Hey everybody, thanks so much for joining us this week.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:02:39):**  I'm actually not in Guatemala for a change.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:02:41):**  I'm visiting my sister out in New Jersey and I thought I'd mix things up a little bit by  
**[0:02:45-0:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:02:45):**  letting her do the intro for this podcast.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:02:48):**  So here's my sister Emily.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:02:51):**  Our guest today is Lydia Dolman, an accomplished natural builder and educator, as well as the  
**[0:02:56-0:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:02:56):**  founder of Flying Hammer, a natural building company based in southern Oregon.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:03:01):**  The company focuses on pushing the boundaries of affordable and energy efficient housing,  
**[0:03:07-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:03:07):**  training people and communities in various building skills, and infusing the dreary urban  
**[0:03:12-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:03:12):**  fabric with structures that reflect beauty, sustainability, and community.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:03:17):**  Lydia is also the author of Light Straw Clay, one of the volumes in the Sustainable Building  
**[0:03:22-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:03:22):**  Essentials series, which will be the focus of this interview.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:03:27):**  In this episode, we go in depth about the world of Light Straw Clay and its wide range  
**[0:03:31-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:03:31):**  of applications and the nuts and bolts of the building technique.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:03:36):**  We talk about permanent and temporary formwork, Larson trusses and split stud framing, different  
**[0:03:42-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:03:42):**  options of plastering and sheathing the walls, and the advantages and challenges of building  
**[0:03:47-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:03:47):**  with clay straw.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:03:49):**  I would highly recommend this interview for anyone looking to build a hybrid structure  
**[0:03:53-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:03:53):**  or to renovate an existing conventional building because of how easy it is to use these techniques  
**[0:03:58-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:03:58):**  in traditional homes.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:04:00):**  So rather than stretching out the intro, I'll just turn things over to Lydia Dolman.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:04:04):**  Hey, Lydia, how are you doing today?  
**[0:04:06-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:04:06):**  Great to have you here.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:04:07):**  I am doing great.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:04:08):**  Thanks for having me.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:04:09):**  I know you've got a lot of projects going on, but before we get into all the technical  
**[0:04:13-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:04:13):**  questions about Light Straw Clay, do you think you could tell our listeners a little bit  
**[0:04:17-0:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:04:17):**  about your background and how you got into natural building?  
**[0:04:21-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:04:21):**  Sure.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:04:22):**  Let's see.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:04:23):**  The short version of a long story of how I got into natural building was I was really  
**[0:04:29-0:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:04:29):**  interested in art and ecology slash biology.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:04:34):**  At one point, I randomly bumped into a group of women in Missoula, Montana who were building  
**[0:04:38-0:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:04:38):**  a straw bale home and kind of the clouds parted and that was my moment.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:04:43):**  I saw the direction I wanted to go.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:04:46):**  Their advice to me was also that I should really learn carpentry, so woodworking as  
**[0:04:50-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:04:50):**  a skill to supplement the in-between times.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:04:53):**  Also, every building I work on needs a superstructure for the most part or involves some wood.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:04:59):**  I've also been working on becoming a very good carpenter over the last 20 years.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:05:03):**  Marvelous.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:05:04):**  Yeah, so like you were saying, I know you've worked with a lot of different natural building  
**[0:05:07-0:05:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:05:07):**  materials and techniques, but today we're going to focus a little bit more on Light  
**[0:05:12-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:05:12):**  Straw Clay.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:05:13):**  Could you explain briefly what Light Straw Clay is and how it's generally used?  
**[0:05:18-0:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:05:18):**  Sure.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:05:19):**  Most people are familiar with either Cobb, which is a monolithic earthen building style,  
**[0:05:24-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:05:24):**  or Straw Bale, which is kind of blocks of straw used as an infill.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:05:28):**  Sometimes it actually carries a load of the roof.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:05:30):**  Light Straw Clay is kind of like a little bit of a mix of the two.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:05:34):**  It's an infill system, which means that it doesn't ever carry the load of the roof, but  
**[0:05:38-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:05:38):**  always works with some kind of superstructure, whether that's wood or adobe or who knows  
**[0:05:42-0:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:05:42):**  what.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:05:43):**  It is loose and straw that gets mixed with a clay slip that acts as a binder, a fire  
**[0:05:49-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:05:49):**  retardant, insect retardant.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:05:53):**  It gets packed into forms, just like you would almost concrete, but very, very different  
**[0:05:59-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:05:59):**  material.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:06:00):**  The forms get removed most of the time, and you have a breathable natural wall system  
**[0:06:04-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:06:04):**  that can be any thickness, almost any height.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:06:07):**  It's a very versatile material.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:06:11):**  That's part of my interest in it, is that it's a great kind of in-between, and it's  
**[0:06:14-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:06:14):**  very modular.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:06:15):**  Sure, and I would imagine the embodied energy of using straw as the primary ingredient keeps  
**[0:06:21-0:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:06:21):**  the carbon footprint and the embodied footprint much lower.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:06:26):**  Yes.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:06:27):**  So in lieu of using any material that's much more processed, this is about as minimally  
**[0:06:32-0:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:06:32):**  processed a building material as you can possibly choose.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:06:36):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:06:37):**  Now, let's break down the process on how to install Light Straw Clay.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:06:40):**  What kind of formwork is needed, and tell us the difference between temporary and permanent  
**[0:06:46-0:06:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:06:46):**  forms.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:06:47):**  Great.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:06:48):**  That's a great question.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:06:49):**  So traditionally, Light Straw Clay was an infill system for timber frame structure,  
**[0:06:55-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:06:55):**  and timber frame is just basically big timbers instead of the stud system that is used in  
**[0:07:01-0:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:07:01):**  conventional construction.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:07:02):**  So generally, we have a secondary framing system that helps hold the straw clay in and  
**[0:07:08-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:07:08):**  also acts as what holds your openings, like your windows and your doors.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:07:12):**  And you would have the secondary framing system.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:07:16):**  That's where it gets a little bit complicated, because there's so many different ways to  
**[0:07:19-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:07:19):**  incorporate Light Straw Clay into a building.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:07:21):**  So I'm just going to go with the most basic one, which is a timber frame with a larson  
**[0:07:25-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:07:25):**  truss.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:07:26):**  And a larson truss is basically like a little ladder that goes in your wall that acts as  
**[0:07:30-0:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:07:30):**  like a secondary holding system.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:07:34):**  And the little ladder has a little bit of wood on one side, a little bit of wood on  
**[0:07:36-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:07:36):**  the other side, and then rungs to kind of keep them equidistant so you can control your  
**[0:07:40-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:07:40):**  wall depth.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:07:41):**  And most Light Straw Clay structures have about a 12-inch thick wall system, which is  
**[0:07:46-0:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:07:46):**  great if you have limited square foot capacity, say you're in an urban area or – because  
**[0:07:52-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:07:52):**  straw bale takes up a significant more space on the perimeter of a building.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:07:57):**  And so you would wrap the building with these larson trusses about every two, three, sometimes  
**[0:08:02-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:08:02):**  four feet on center, which really limits the amount of wood that you are using, which is  
**[0:08:07-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:08:07):**  great compared to conventional construction.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:08:10):**  And then if you're using a temporary form system, is you use plywood or some kind of  
**[0:08:15-0:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:08:15):**  dimensional lumber, but mostly it's plywood, and you screw this to those studs or to your  
**[0:08:20-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:08:20):**  timber frame.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:08:22):**  And then you make your Light Straw Clay mix, which is basically a straw bale that gets  
**[0:08:25-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:08:25):**  loosened.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:08:26):**  You cut the strings, and then you're making a clay slip, and that can be either with pure  
**[0:08:30-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:08:30):**  clay or native soil, which has a clay content that gets turned into milkshake consistency.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:08:35):**  You mix them up, you toss them like a big salad, and then you pack this into the wall  
**[0:08:40-0:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:08:40):**  system.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:08:41):**  And yeah.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:08:43):**  And then as you go, once you pass your forms, you leapfrog the forms.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:08:47):**  You're immediately taking the forms off, and then you have this solid, breathable, wonderful  
**[0:08:52-0:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:08:52):**  and nicely flat wall system.  
**[0:08:55-0:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:08:55):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:08:56):**  So since Light Straw Clay itself isn't load bearing, as you mentioned before, there needs  
**[0:09:02-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:09:02):**  to be structural supports around the walls to hold up the roof.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:09:05):**  Could you tell me a little bit about how framing and building for Light Straw Clay infill,  
**[0:09:11-0:09:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:09:11):**  sort of the different options that are available and some of the most common ones?  
**[0:09:16-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:09:16):**  So the most common one would probably be the traditional timber frame.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:09:20):**  The pros of that are that it's beautiful.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:09:23):**  You're using larger timbers at larger intervals.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:09:27):**  In theory, you could be using less wood than you would in a conventional construction project.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:09:33):**  The next one I would say would be where you're using a Larson truss framing, or a similar  
**[0:09:38-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:09:38):**  component to that is split stud framing.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:09:41):**  You could also use pole framing, which is great if you live in a wooded area and you  
**[0:09:45-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:09:45):**  have access to a lot of small diameter poles.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:09:48):**  And then the other one is you can get a little, you can branch out a bit.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:09:52):**  And if you have Adobe, you could use Adobe pillars as something to hold your roof structure  
**[0:09:56-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:09:56):**  up.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:09:57):**  You could combine it with some kind of metal superstructure.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:10:00):**  Kind of the sky is the limit.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:10:02):**  So that's the beauty of Light Straw Clay is it can infill around just about anything.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:10:07):**  And then I think you also asked me about a difference between temporary and permanent  
**[0:10:11-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:10:11):**  forms.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:10:12):**  Right.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:10:13):**  And depending on your framing system, you can either use the plywood that you then peel  
**[0:10:17-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:10:17):**  off, which can sometimes feel particularly for a larger project, like you're purchasing  
**[0:10:20-0:10:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:10:20):**  a lot of plywood that you may or may not use again.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:10:24):**  Some people are creative and they save some of it so that they can sheath their roof with  
**[0:10:28-0:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:10:28):**  it or eventually have a lot of shelving material.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:10:31):**  But the other option is permanent form work and that's either using a wood lathe, which  
**[0:10:35-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:10:35):**  is little strips of wood, which is a traditional plaster backing method.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:10:41):**  And those are just little strips of wood that are spaced about a finger width apart and  
**[0:10:45-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:10:45):**  they stay there.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:10:46):**  And then your Light Straw Clay just falls into a cavity and then you plaster over the  
**[0:10:49-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:10:49):**  wood lathe.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:10:50):**  The other one is a reed mat or you can get really creative with whatever kind of permanent  
**[0:10:57-0:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:10:57):**  form work you can put in there, whether it's wire mesh or I've seen all sorts of creative  
**[0:11:03-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:11:03):**  things, but those we could branch out pretty far in that department.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:11:06):**  But for the most part, those are the two ways to kind of do a permanent form work and then  
**[0:11:10-0:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:11:10):**  you're not removing anything and it's permanently in there and becomes part of your structure.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:11:14):**  Excellent.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:11:15):**  That's really well explained.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:11:16):**  And you know, I know there's always going to be some limitations when we just talk about  
**[0:11:19-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:11:19):**  these things, but for anybody who's really interested, the diagrams and the drawings  
**[0:11:23-0:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:11:23):**  that are in the essential series on Light Straw Clay are fantastic and really help to  
**[0:11:27-0:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:11:27):**  clarify all these things that we're talking about here.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:11:30):**  One thing that I would like you to sort of clarify just a little bit, you mentioned briefly  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:11:35):**  split stud framing and I thought it was fascinating because I actually hadn't used it this way  
**[0:11:40-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:11:40):**  before the way that they're set off center.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:11:43):**  And could you tell me about how that's used and sort of what it does for preventing thermal  
**[0:11:48-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:11:48):**  bridging?  
**[0:11:49-0:11:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:11:49):**  Right great question.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:11:51):**  So some people might have been exposed to split stud framing and working in acoustic  
**[0:11:57-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:11:57):**  situations.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:11:58):**  So if you're trying to soundproof or limit the sound transfer from one wall to another,  
**[0:12:03-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:12:03):**  say a recording studio or an apartment wall, sound will follow a path of the dense material.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:12:12):**  So if you had a 12 inch stud to separate your big thick wall system, the sound would travel  
**[0:12:18-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:12:18):**  through that 12 inch stud directly to the other side.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:12:21):**  By splitting the studs and offsetting them, you mitigate a little bit of that sound transfer.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:12:26):**  The other thing that you're mitigating is thermal bridging where you have a less dense  
**[0:12:31-0:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:12:31):**  material like the straw clay in your stud cavities which gets you a great R value of  
**[0:12:36-0:12:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:12:36):**  R21 if you're doing 12 inches thick.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:12:39):**  But then your stud itself has a much lower R value.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:12:42):**  So you're actually transferring heat and you're diminishing the overall insulation quality  
**[0:12:46-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:12:46):**  of your wall system.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:12:48):**  So having the offset studs is a way of kind of weaving a continuous thermal envelope of  
**[0:12:53-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:12:53):**  your light straw clay throughout your wall system instead of breaking it up into stud  
**[0:12:56-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:12:56):**  cavities.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:12:57):**  The other nice thing about that is because you're using essentially a clay based material,  
**[0:13:02-0:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:13:02):**  clay once it dries, it shrinks just a little bit.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:13:05):**  And by offsetting those studs, you mitigate that shrinkage so you're not getting a draft  
**[0:13:09-0:13:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:13:09):**  whereas if you had a straight 12 inch 2 by 12 stud there is you would get a little gap  
**[0:13:16-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:13:16):**  and that would allow a little bit of air transfer there and making your wall system less efficient  
**[0:13:20-0:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:13:20):**  that way as well.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:13:21):**  Sure.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:13:22):**  Compromising the envelope just a little bit.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:13:24):**  So in your book like we talked about, you have some fantastic charts and tables explaining  
**[0:13:29-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:13:29):**  the properties of clay straw as a wall filling material.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:13:33):**  Could you briefly go over some of the properties such as insulation value like you mentioned  
**[0:13:37-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:13:37):**  for the 12 inch wall, fire ratings, and generally how it performs acoustically?  
**[0:13:42-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:13:42):**  Yeah, so this is the fun thing about writing a book is that you get to do a lot of research  
**[0:13:48-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:13:48):**  and then you get to find out where there are big gaps in the research.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:13:53):**  One of them, there's only Franz Wolhard's book that talked a little bit about sound  
**[0:13:58-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:13:58):**  transfer but you can imagine in a dense material, so if any listeners here have been in a concrete  
**[0:14:06-0:14:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:14:06):**  room versus a soft padded room you notice that there's a very different acoustic quality  
**[0:14:13-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:14:13):**  and his calculations on the sound transfer were based on what a denser wall system might,  
**[0:14:20-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:14:20):**  how that might transfer the sound through the wall system.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:14:24):**  So in my experience of building particularly for compact living situations and roommate  
**[0:14:29-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:14:29):**  situations having the light straw clay between those rooms helps dampen the sound just because  
**[0:14:34-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:14:34):**  it is big and dense and if we've done our split stud it helps mitigate the sound transfer  
**[0:14:40-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:14:40):**  through the wall which can make for a nicer living situation depending on who is sharing  
**[0:14:46-0:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:14:46):**  the wall with you.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:14:48):**  In terms of fire resistance there have been some studies done, the nice thing, the way  
**[0:14:53-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:14:53):**  to break it down in the simplest terms is that you have each little piece of straw is  
**[0:14:58-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:14:58):**  wrapped in clay and clay doesn't burn.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:15:01):**  So if you, and it's also a pretty dense wall system so there's very limited oxygen available  
**[0:15:06-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:15:06):**  for combustion in this situation.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:15:08):**  So I have personally taken a blowtorch to light straw clay once it's dry and notice  
**[0:15:14-0:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:15:14):**  that it doesn't combust.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:15:16):**  The same is true of a straw bale because it's so dense that you're not getting enough oxygen  
**[0:15:21-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:15:21):**  for full on combustion but you will have a smoldering situation and which is great in  
**[0:15:26-0:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:15:26):**  terms of fire safety.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:15:28):**  And then your first question about insulation is it's all based on how tightly you compact  
**[0:15:35-0:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:15:35):**  the light straw clay mixture into your wall.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:15:37):**  So with each project I try to stress that you do a little test block so you can figure  
**[0:15:44-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:15:44):**  out your pounds per square foot.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:15:46):**  So our insulation ratings are based on 13 pounds per square foot and that's basically  
**[0:15:50-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:15:50):**  you build a little box with a square foot on the inside, you do a few mixes of light  
**[0:15:55-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:15:55):**  straw clay with kind of an idea of how tightly you're compacting it, you let it dry and then  
**[0:15:59-0:16:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:15:59):**  you weigh it.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:16:00):**  And if you have a 13 pound square foot block of light straw clay then you've achieved the  
**[0:16:04-0:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:16:04):**  density that will get you to the highest R value.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:16:09):**  And that way you can have a much more insulative system.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:16:12):**  Excellent, yeah that's really great for reference especially for people trying to integrate  
**[0:16:17-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:16:17):**  this in with a home design in different climates and knowing how it's going to perform really  
**[0:16:22-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:16:22):**  gives them the information that they need to see where it will apply most effectively.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:16:27):**  I know from my own experiences working with organic building materials that there's always  
**[0:16:31-0:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:16:31):**  a risk of rot and decomposition.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:16:34):**  What climates are light straw clay most appropriate for and are there any places that you would  
**[0:16:40-0:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:16:40):**  not recommend using it?  
**[0:16:44-0:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:16:44):**  Another good question.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:16:45):**  My experience with light straw clay even in really wet cold climates is that clay really  
**[0:16:52-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:16:52):**  despite it's a fascinating material but it dries out and then it stays dry.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:17:00):**  So I have one project that's in a riparian area, it's a 3500 feet in the Siskiyous, it's  
**[0:17:08-0:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:17:08):**  a very cold wet area and we infilled it in the summer and we never plastered it and it  
**[0:17:15-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:17:15):**  continues to be completely solid, no signs of rotting, no signs of insect infestation  
**[0:17:20-0:17:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:17:20):**  at all and this is about seven years.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:17:23):**  So that is a nice experiment and testament to the fact that it has the tendency to want  
**[0:17:27-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:17:27):**  to self-regulate to being dry and then there's a group of folks up in Alaska where they have  
**[0:17:32-0:17:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:17:32):**  a very short building season.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:17:36):**  So this is the one thing where I usually try to get an idea of someone's climate before  
**[0:17:44-0:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:17:44):**  kind of steering them in a direction of what wall system would be best for them but their  
**[0:17:47-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:17:47):**  way of working around a short building season which basically means a season where it's  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:17:51):**  sunny and dry most of the time because light straw clay generally requires about an inch  
**[0:17:56-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:17:56):**  per week of wall thickness for drying and that's just a general guideline to kind of  
**[0:18:01-0:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:18:01):**  help people figure out when to start their project and when to anticipate that it will  
**[0:18:06-0:18:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:18:06):**  be dry.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:18:08):**  So these folks in Alaska knowing that they have very short season decided to make bricks  
**[0:18:13-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:18:13):**  and increasing the surface area so that everything dried in a brick form and then stack that  
**[0:18:17-0:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:18:17):**  into their walls was a way of using light straw clay and bypassing their climate limitations.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:18:22):**  So once light straw clay is dry, I would say it is a fantastic material and I wouldn't  
**[0:18:28-0:18:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:18:28):**  worry so much about humidity, I wouldn't worry about rain touching the wall, just tends  
**[0:18:32-0:18:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:18:32):**  to – I mean I would worry about rain touching the wall continuously but intermittent windblown  
**[0:18:37-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:18:37):**  rain seems to not deteriorate the wall in a way that I would have had hesitancy in the  
**[0:18:44-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:18:44):**  past just based on my experience.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:18:47):**  That's really good to know.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:18:49):**  Could you talk a little bit while we're on this subject about some of the other disadvantages  
**[0:18:53-0:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:18:53):**  of straw clay and some of the ways that those disadvantages can be mitigated when building  
**[0:18:59-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:18:59):**  or designing a structure.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:19:00):**  Now I assume this is relative to maybe other industrial options for wall fill systems.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:19:05):**  Right.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:19:06):**  So if I understand correctly, usually I give people the pros and cons and the pros, it's  
**[0:19:16-0:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:19:16):**  very user friendly, homeowners can easily be involved, it's non-toxic, the materials  
**[0:19:23-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:19:23):**  themselves are very affordable.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:19:24):**  The downside is that it can be very labor intensive.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:19:27):**  So if you are in a situation where you're very limited on your labor budget whether  
**[0:19:32-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:19:32):**  that is you're in a very remote location or you have a very limited budget for building  
**[0:19:39-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:19:39):**  your project, then I might just put that little note saying that you will probably need a  
**[0:19:44-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:19:44):**  lot of people for a short period of time in order to do the infill situation.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:19:50):**  And then the other thing would be the dry time is something to consider.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:19:54):**  So if you – which really dictates when you can build your project.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:19:59):**  And for most projects people start and break ground in the spring, try to get their infill  
**[0:20:03-0:20:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:20:03):**  and their walls done, sometimes mid-summer to early fall and then they're plastering  
**[0:20:08-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:20:08):**  ideally early fall and not much into the freezing weather.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:20:12):**  But a well-designed home should be fine without a plaster skin for a winter or multiple winters.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:20:19):**  So the downside would be that ideally you really want to get your roof on before it  
**[0:20:24-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:20:24):**  starts raining which for a complicated project or for a short building season those can sometimes  
**[0:20:32-0:20:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:20:32):**  really shift the scale to try to exploring a different wall system.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:20:36):**  Yeah, definitely in my experience there's been a few rushes trying to get those roofs  
**[0:20:40-0:20:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:20:40):**  on as fast as possible and oftentimes in – depending on the climate or the situation I'll just  
**[0:20:45-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:20:45):**  recommend to the clients that they build the structure and the roof first and worry about  
**[0:20:51-0:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:20:51):**  the wall system or the infill later on to get around either the shortness of season  
**[0:20:58-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:20:58):**  or any other climactic elements that could throw things off and delay the project.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:21:03):**  Right.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:21:04):**  I mean having a roof on makes for a much – you have a dry space to put everything for the  
**[0:21:09-0:21:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:21:09):**  duration of your project which is great.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:21:12):**  And for some projects sometimes it's – if someone's coming from a very conventional  
**[0:21:17-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:21:17):**  background trying to adjust to some of the different nuances of light straw clay or any  
**[0:21:22-0:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:21:22):**  kind of natural wall system can be a bit of an adjustment particularly for all the other  
**[0:21:26-0:21:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:21:26):**  facets that go into it be it plumbing, electrical, how you're heating and cooling the place.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:21:32):**  Those can be a little bit of a learning curve for people coming from a more conventional  
**[0:21:36-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:21:36):**  background.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:21:37):**  Yeah, sure.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:21:38):**  I've definitely found that to be the case.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:21:39):**  So let's assume that everything dries correctly.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:21:42):**  You've installed it the way that it needs to be.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:21:45):**  What are some of the most important things to know about maintaining a light straw clay  
**[0:21:48-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:21:48):**  wall and making sure that it lasts as long as possible?  
**[0:21:52-0:21:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:21:52):**  Well, the first way to maintain a light straw clay building or any building is good design  
**[0:21:57-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:21:57):**  right from the first – right from the get-go.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:22:00):**  So taking in a good analysis of your site location, the climate, how it's going to  
**[0:22:07-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:22:07):**  be used, those are the first ways to make something durable is to do an appropriate  
**[0:22:12-0:22:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:22:12):**  and long-lasting design.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:22:14):**  Then there's the old adage of a good boots and good hat to make sure that your building  
**[0:22:20-0:22:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:22:20):**  is up enough off the ground so that if you do get snow drips or windblown rain or splash  
**[0:22:25-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:22:25):**  back off your roof is you're not kind of creating a situation that's going to end  
**[0:22:29-0:22:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:22:29):**  up being a long-term issue.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:22:31):**  So keeping water away from the building is another key for maintaining it.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:22:36):**  Then it comes down to basically – usually at this point, straw bale is old enough that  
**[0:22:42-0:22:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:22:42):**  we're at the point of remodeling straw bale buildings and that is a whole – that could  
**[0:22:47-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:22:47):**  be a book in its own.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:22:49):**  But I see the same thing probably happening with light straw clay.  
**[0:22:53-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:22:53):**  So there is designing and building and then maintaining a building through multiple people  
**[0:23:00-0:23:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:23:00):**  and having their time in that building.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:23:03):**  So if you're building a building that's going to last 500 years, you could have a  
**[0:23:06-0:23:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:23:06):**  lot of different people living in there with a lot of different needs.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:23:09):**  So finding the most versatile wall finishes I think is one of the biggest things to keeping  
**[0:23:16-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:23:16):**  a building well-maintained.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:23:18):**  So most people either finish a light straw clay building in either lime plaster or an  
**[0:23:22-0:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:23:22):**  earthen plaster.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:23:26):**  The pros of the lime plaster is it's very durable.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:23:29):**  It doesn't degrade in the presence of water and you can get brighter colors with it.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:23:35):**  However, it has much more embodied energy.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:23:37):**  It's much more difficult to work with for some people and it is much harder to patch  
**[0:23:42-0:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:23:42):**  and repair whereas earth plaster is very user-friendly, very easy to repair, very minimally embodied  
**[0:23:50-0:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:23:50):**  energy.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:23:51):**  However, if you stood there with a garden hose, you could wash your whole plaster off.  
**[0:23:56-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:23:56):**  So that's the downside of the earth plaster.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:23:58):**  But I generally – if it's designed well, I would steer people towards an earthen plaster  
**[0:24:02-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:24:02):**  just because the long-term maintenance for an earthen plaster is much easier than a lime  
**[0:24:08-0:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:24:08):**  plaster for people.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:24:10):**  Although traditionally, people have maintained their exterior buildings with light straw  
**[0:24:14-0:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:24:14):**  – with the exterior of their buildings with a lime plaster and that is very, very durable.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:24:21):**  So there's kind of two schools of thought there.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:24:23):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:24:24):**  Now, I personally am a huge fan of different types of earthen renders, either lime or clay.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:24:30):**  I teach them in the courses and like you said, the user-friendliness of clay makes it really  
**[0:24:35-0:24:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:24:35):**  approachable for just about anybody.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:24:37):**  But the durability of lime is really helpful for exteriors especially if you're in kind  
**[0:24:41-0:24:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:24:41):**  of a heavy climate with a lot of storms or heavy rain.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:24:47):**  But could we also go over a little bit about different options for cladding?  
**[0:24:50-0:24:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:24:50):**  I know we could do some sort of sheathing options.  
**[0:24:55-0:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:24:55):**  What else is available for light straw clay?  
**[0:24:58-0:25:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:24:58):**  I've worked on several projects that in order to kind of fit in with the aesthetic of the  
**[0:25:02-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:25:02):**  neighborhood or the rest of the property, we've done what's called a rain screen.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:25:07):**  And that is where we fur out so that there is an air space for airflow on the outside  
**[0:25:12-0:25:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:25:12):**  of our light straw clay which then has a little bit of earthen plaster over it just to hopefully  
**[0:25:18-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:25:18):**  mitigate any insects or water or anything in there.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:25:22):**  And then you have a little air space.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:25:24):**  And then you have wood clad whether it's board and batten or some kind of tongue and groove  
**[0:25:29-0:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:25:29):**  or some kind of bevel groove siding.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:25:31):**  You can put whatever siding on the exterior like.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:25:34):**  I haven't experimented with metal but I wouldn't say that you couldn't do it based on given  
**[0:25:40-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:25:40):**  that you would have a breathable air space on the exterior.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:25:43):**  So you could have a very, very durable exterior that looks like any other building with light  
**[0:25:50-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:25:50):**  straw clay.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:25:51):**  And that's one of the bonuses of the secondary framing system that is part of light straw  
**[0:25:55-0:25:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:25:55):**  clay is that you have a lot of attachment points for any kind of exterior siding or  
**[0:25:59-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:25:59):**  if you're talking about shelving, etc.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:26:02):**  And you can also, I've worked on projects where we've done the lower half in a rain  
**[0:26:08-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:26:08):**  screen and then done plaster up above.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:26:11):**  So really the sky's the limit from a design perspective with light straw clay.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:26:16):**  And that's one of the reasons that I really, I love using it is it's so versatile.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:26:20):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:26:21):**  Speaking of that versatility, one of the reasons why I was attracted to this and you know,  
**[0:26:25-0:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:26:25):**  I've only worked with it a small amount, but I know that light straw clay can be used to  
**[0:26:30-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:26:30):**  retrofit existing buildings, both natural and industrial.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:26:33):**  Could you walk me through some of the ways that you would need to alter a building to  
**[0:26:37-0:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:26:37):**  accommodate a straw clay infill?  
**[0:26:39-0:26:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:26:39):**  Yes.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:26:40):**  So this is one of the things that really was a big motivator for me to write the book is  
**[0:26:45-0:26:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:26:45):**  just that it is, you don't have to do new construction in order to implement light straw  
**[0:26:50-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:26:50):**  clay, which I think from an energy intensive standpoint, new construction is very environmentally  
**[0:26:56-0:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:26:56):**  expensive and retrofitting buildings is a great way to not basically break new ground.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:27:02):**  Yeah, that's a really good point.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:27:04):**  And there are so many different ways to do it.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:27:07):**  And that's another thing I love about it is it just fosters creativity.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:27:11):**  And so if you're, say you're working with an existing, maybe 1900s craftsman style bungalow  
**[0:27:18-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:27:18):**  and the Pacific Northwest, which is what I'm most familiar with, and you're looking at  
**[0:27:23-0:27:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:27:23):**  a two by four wall system and you want to be fed up and you can either bump your walls  
**[0:27:30-0:27:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:27:30):**  to the interior, which will cost you some interior square footage.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:27:35):**  And that's usually the simplest way to do it because sometimes you have to contend with  
**[0:27:40-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:27:40):**  creating a secondary foundation to bump your wall out another eight inches on the exterior,  
**[0:27:44-0:27:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:27:44):**  which is one of the challenges of retrofits in that direction.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:27:49):**  And some people, there's a lot of buildings in North America that are not insulated at  
**[0:27:53-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:27:53):**  all.  
**[0:27:54-0:27:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:27:54):**  So if you put any insulation in, you're doing a much, you're adding to the situation, you're  
**[0:27:59-0:28:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:27:59):**  improving the situation.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:28:00):**  But if you really want to take it so that you're actually meeting energy code and, or  
**[0:28:04-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:28:04):**  at least the North American energy code of our 21 wall system as you'd be trying to achieve  
**[0:28:10-0:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:28:10):**  a foot thick, um, light struck clay wall system.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:28:14):**  And that is once again, either bumping it towards the inside and you could either do  
**[0:28:18-0:28:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:28:18):**  staggered stud construction.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:28:20):**  And one little side note here is I'm using a lot of terms and vocabulary, but some of  
**[0:28:27-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:28:27):**  these are just, it would be very easy to explain this to a conventional contractor to show  
**[0:28:30-0:28:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:28:30):**  him your framing or her, your framing system.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:28:33):**  And they would be able to do it without having to do this immense learning curve where if  
**[0:28:38-0:28:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:28:38):**  you were trying to explain Cobb or load bearing, Strava bill might be a little bit foreign  
**[0:28:41-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:28:41):**  to them.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:28:42):**  So that's, I feel like that this is a great gateway for people with a very conventional  
**[0:28:45-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:28:45):**  background to plug in and have a natural wall system.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:28:49):**  And same with the retrofit because remodeling, a lot of people end up remodeling their house  
**[0:28:54-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:28:54):**  at one time or another.  
**[0:28:56-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:28:56):**  And so the other concept is to bump your wall to the outside.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:28:59):**  And that is, that requires a little bit more engineering because you're involving probably  
**[0:29:04-0:29:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:29:04):**  you'll have to consider the overhangs of your roof and you'll also have to consider some  
**[0:29:09-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:29:09):**  kind of secondary foundation.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:29:11):**  And sometimes those will require a little bit more engineering, particularly in, you  
**[0:29:16-0:29:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:29:16):**  know, if you're in a seismic zone to create a foundation that actually works together  
**[0:29:19-0:29:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:29:19):**  in a seismic event.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:29:20):**  I don't know if that really answered your question, but there's just a lot of ways to  
**[0:29:25-0:29:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:29:25):**  frame, to adjust your framing to accommodate a light straw clay infill.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:29:30):**  No, that's fantastic.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:29:31):**  Yeah, that definitely answers the question.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:29:33):**  And it sounds to me like light straw clay would also work really well in hybrid buildings  
**[0:29:38-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:29:38):**  that use more than one natural building material to sort of get the best performance from your  
**[0:29:42-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:29:42):**  structure.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:29:43):**  Could you give me some examples of other building materials that light straw clay works well  
**[0:29:47-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:29:47):**  with and what applications those might be used for?  
**[0:29:52-0:29:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:29:52):**  My immediate answer is that it works well with everything.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:29:54):**  But that may or may not be true.  
**[0:29:56-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:29:56):**  But my experience being primarily a straw bale builder is that in every project I'm  
**[0:30:00-0:30:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:30:00):**  incorporating light straw clay at some point.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:30:02):**  And most of those are for passive solar in the northern hemisphere is you're putting  
**[0:30:06-0:30:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:30:06):**  a lot of glass and openings on the south face of your building.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:30:10):**  And trying to wrap a 36 to 44 inch straw bale around all the window openings in the south  
**[0:30:15-0:30:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:30:15):**  side generally doesn't work that well.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:30:18):**  It becomes very inefficient.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:30:19):**  And with all of that framing to hold up your glass and your doors, light straw clay becomes  
**[0:30:23-0:30:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:30:23):**  much more appropriate for the south side of any straw bale building in the northern hemisphere,  
**[0:30:28-0:30:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:30:28):**  the reverse in the southern hemisphere.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:30:32):**  And that way you're still getting relatively thick wall system to kind of match the aesthetic  
**[0:30:36-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:30:36):**  of the interior of the rest of your building.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:30:39):**  But you're not trying to notch a bunch of straw bales around all the posts and the framing  
**[0:30:43-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:30:43):**  in the windows, which for anyone with straw bale experience, it's it become the more framing  
**[0:30:48-0:30:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:30:48):**  you're trying to wrap your straw bales around, the more complicated it gets and the more  
**[0:30:52-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:30:52):**  you kind of compromise the integrity of the straw bale.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:30:54):**  But if you can essentially unfurl that entire straw bale, dip it in clay and pack it into  
**[0:30:58-0:31:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:30:58):**  the wall system, you still have a very similar well performing wall system, particularly  
**[0:31:05-0:31:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:31:05):**  for the south side of your building.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:31:06):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:31:07):**  Yeah, those are really good points.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:31:09):**  It definitely gets really, really complicated when you're trying to carve individual bales  
**[0:31:14-0:31:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:31:14):**  all around that that framing structure.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:31:16):**  Yes.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:31:17):**  I get to I get to feel like a sculptor.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:31:20):**  Sometimes at work when I am trying to get all these crazy wood intersections carved  
**[0:31:25-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:31:25):**  out into a straw bale so it'll fit nicely there, whereas straw clay would really do  
**[0:31:28-0:31:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:31:28):**  a much easier job.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:31:29):**  Right.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:31:30):**  Yeah.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:31:31):**  So as much fun as it is for building skill sets, you could also just do light straw clay  
**[0:31:34-0:31:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:31:34):**  and have it done much faster.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:31:36):**  Right.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:31:38):**  So fantastic.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:31:39):**  Before you go, could you tell our listeners how they can find sort of your other educational  
**[0:31:43-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:31:43):**  resources and learn more about your work?  
**[0:31:45-0:31:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:31:45):**  Oh, well, I do have a website, the flying hammer dot com.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:31:50):**  And that, yeah, I'm not the most technologically savvy person, so I don't update it as frequently  
**[0:31:56-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:31:56):**  as I should.  
**[0:31:57-0:31:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:31:57):**  But there's a frequently asked questions page.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:31:59):**  There's some resources.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:32:01):**  There's some blogs on there.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:32:03):**  The Internet is a great resource.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:32:05):**  And I am a bibliophile, so I love books.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:32:09):**  And yeah, books are also a great resource, too.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:32:13):**  And there's there is a plethora of books on straw bale.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:32:16):**  There are a lot of books on Cobb.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:32:19):**  And now we're finally starting to flush out the third branch of the natural building tree  
**[0:32:24-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:32:24):**  with light straw clay.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:32:25):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:32:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:32:27):**  And I'd really like to encourage all of our listeners to go to your website, too.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:32:30):**  I've used it as a resource for a long time.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:32:32):**  You have some fantastic information out there, which is really useful for us in the larger  
**[0:32:37-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:32:37):**  industry.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:32:38):**  So thanks for putting that out there.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:32:39):**  Oh, great.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:32:40):**  My pleasure.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:32:41):**  I feel like the more people know, the better choices we can all make.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:32:44):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:32:45):**  And hey, that's the point of this podcast as well.

**[0:33:53-0:33:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:33:53):**  So before we wrap up this show for the week, I've got some exciting news about the upcoming  
**[0:33:57-0:34:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:33:57):**  months and I'm joined here now with my good friend and founder of Atitlan Organics, Shad  
**[0:34:02-0:34:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:34:02):**  Goodsy.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:34:03):**  Hey buddy, what's new?  
**[0:34:04-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:34:04):**  Oh man, so much is happening.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:34:07):**  First off though, I just want to say thanks for having me man.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:34:09):**  I really love your podcast and I actually had a great time doing that interview back  
**[0:34:13-0:34:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:34:13):**  in one of the earlier episodes.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:34:15):**  Anyway, probably what's most exciting is our new collaboration between Atitlan Organics  
**[0:34:20-0:34:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:34:20):**  and Abundant Edge.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:34:22):**  As you know, we've been offering permaculture design courses for over six years now and  
**[0:34:26-0:34:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:34:26):**  they really have become a staple here in Lake Atitlan.  
**[0:34:30-0:34:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:34:30):**  In particular though, the intro to permaculture course is just an amazing way for travelers,  
**[0:34:35-0:34:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:34:35):**  gardeners, architects, basically anyone to fully immerse themselves in this new paradigm  
**[0:34:41-0:34:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:34:41):**  of permaculture design.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:34:42):**  Like honestly, you can't take this course and still see the world the same way afterward.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:34:48):**  It's life changing.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:34:49):**  But like I said, what I'm most excited about is that now, thanks to our collaboration,  
**[0:34:55-0:35:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:34:55):**  we're going to be able to offer your natural building course immediately after every one  
**[0:35:00-0:35:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:35:00):**  of our intro to permaculture courses.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:35:02):**  Literally, this two week offering is like possibly the most complete package that I  
**[0:35:08-0:35:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:35:08):**  know of available anywhere.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:35:11):**  Basically with these two courses alone, I think that someone should have everything  
**[0:35:15-0:35:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:35:15):**  they need to start their own regenerative project or just their own regenerative lifestyle.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:35:21):**  That's what I'm excited about man.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:35:22):**  But yeah, what about you?  
**[0:35:24-0:35:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:35:24):**  What's going on?  
**[0:35:25-0:35:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:35:25):**  Man, well, you know already that me and the Abundant Edge team are gearing up for a big  
**[0:35:29-0:35:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:35:29):**  season as well.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:35:30):**  I mean, starting in November, we'll be breaking ground on a regenerative farming demonstration  
**[0:35:35-0:35:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:35:35):**  site, which is of course right down the hill from your farm.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:35:38):**  We'll be building animal pens, a classroom, outdoor kitchens and lounge areas connected  
**[0:35:43-0:35:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:35:43):**  to houses and it's all going to be made out of natural materials.  
**[0:35:47-0:35:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:35:47):**  I mean, the site is going to serve as a demonstration farm for perennial and regenerative farming  
**[0:35:52-0:35:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:35:52):**  methods for years and years to come.  
**[0:35:54-0:35:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:35:54):**  And we'll even be offering courses and internship opportunities to people who want to learn  
**[0:35:58-0:36:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:35:58):**  for themselves about how to build with natural materials and set up their own farms.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:36:04):**  Heck yeah, that sounds amazing man.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:36:06):**  And honestly, this is just about the best place in the world to learn all these things  
**[0:36:10-0:36:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:36:10):**  too.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:36:11):**  I mean, this little town of Sununah in the gorgeous tropical mountains of Guatemala,  
**[0:36:15-0:36:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:36:15):**  like right here on the shores of Lake Atitlan, it's one of the most beautiful places in the  
**[0:36:19-0:36:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:36:19):**  world.  
**[0:36:20-0:36:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:36:20):**  And on top of that, you have this traditional indigenous Mayan culture that's still rich  
**[0:36:24-0:36:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:36:24):**  and alive.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:36:25):**  And probably my favorite part is that we have this world international community of alternative  
**[0:36:31-0:36:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:36:31):**  people that are open to new ideas and really putting things into practice.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:36:36):**  I mean within walking distance of the bamboo guest house, you've got loads of things going  
**[0:36:40-0:36:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:36:40):**  on.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:36:41):**  We got the projects that we've already talked about, but you also have yoga retreat centers.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:36:45):**  You have Charlie Rendell's natural bamboo building school.  
**[0:36:48-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:36:48):**  You have Love Probiotics, you got Fungi Academy and honestly loads more alternative blow your  
**[0:36:54-0:36:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:36:54):**  mind type stuff.  
**[0:36:55-0:36:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:36:55):**  I honestly just feel like this is where it's all happening.  
**[0:36:58-0:37:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:36:58):**  Yeah, it really does.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:37:00):**  And I want to get as many people as possible in on these projects, but we've got to make  
**[0:37:04-0:37:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:37:04):**  sure that they've got the skills first.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:37:06):**  So what do you say?  
**[0:37:07-0:37:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:37:07):**  Let's offer a big discount to those who sign up for both courses.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:37:10):**  I mean, all food and lodging and the amazing bamboo guest house is already included in  
**[0:37:14-0:37:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:37:14):**  the tuition.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:37:15):**  So this will be like the best deal that we've ever offered.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:37:18):**  That's a great idea.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:37:19):**  Because I mean, people can still take just one course if that's what they're into, or  
**[0:37:23-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:37:23):**  if they can't make the full two weeks.  
**[0:37:25-0:37:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:37:25):**  But this will actually make the two courses more accessible to even a wider audience of  
**[0:37:29-0:37:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:37:29):**  people.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lydia-doleman/#t=0:37:30):**  That way more people can get the knowledge that they need to get started doing what they

**[0:04:10-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:04:10):**  away from what many people consider to be kind of a dependent or consumerist lifestyle  
**[0:04:15-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:04:15):**  where you're buying most of the things that you consume.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:04:19):**  Tell us first a little bit about your personal background and then we'll start talking about  
**[0:04:24-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:04:24):**  how you made this switch in lifestyle for yourself.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:04:27):**  Well, this is great.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:04:28):**  I don't usually get to talk about my homesteading lifestyle with my work.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:04:34):**  So I'm excited to be diving into my discoveries and the way that I function on a daily basis  
**[0:04:44-0:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:04:44):**  out here in the woods soon.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:04:47):**  But to start off, how I got here, right?  
**[0:04:50-0:04:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:04:50):**  That's what you're asking is my journey up till this point.  
**[0:04:54-0:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:04:54):**  So my goodness, well, I didn't grow up as a activist or a homesteader or somebody who  
**[0:05:03-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:05:03):**  was close to the land or anti-consumerism at all.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:05:07):**  I had a very, I would say, middle-class Costco consumer, highly consumptive childhood.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:05:21):**  I didn't grow up in a place where people were even thinking of not consuming.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:05:26):**  Now there was talk about being able to pay the bills and talk about being able to stay  
**[0:05:33-0:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:05:33):**  financially secure.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:05:35):**  But it wasn't about stopping consumption because of resources or the earth.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:05:40):**  So that concept really didn't come to me until I probably left my family home.

**[0:05:56-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:05:56):**  for climate change or the Anthropocene or so many social environmental climate justice

**[0:06:08-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:06:08):**  that I was frustrated about, like factory farms, like government, just government, what's  
**[0:06:19-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:06:19):**  the word?  
**[0:06:20-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:06:20):**  There's so much to say there, but yeah.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:06:22):**  You can see what you're saying all about government.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:06:25):**  Yeah, I'm like, where do I begin and end on that one?  
**[0:06:30-0:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:06:30):**  And so, yeah, I was awakened to an extent when I was younger, but I didn't really have  
**[0:06:39-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:06:39):**  all the information that I needed to be making the decisions that I make today.

**[0:06:52-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:06:52):**  literature.

**[0:07:00-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:07:00):**  and I was fascinated by how people have been controlled over the last few thousand years  
**[0:07:08-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:07:08):**  and what people have believed in and how that has guided their lifestyles and their choices.

**[0:07:23-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:07:23):**  more on the environment.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:07:24):**  So I ended up going to grad school in New York for environmental sciences, but after  
**[0:07:33-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:07:33):**  about, I think a year and a half, I dropped out to be a full-time political organizer  
**[0:07:37-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:07:37):**  at Occupy Wall Street.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:07:39):**  And I was never a political organizer before.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:07:43):**  I did not have the experience, but I had a lot of passion and I was so excited to finally  
**[0:07:49-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:07:49):**  be around other people who were passionate and yeah, that enraged feeling and willing  
**[0:07:57-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:07:57):**  to talk about it and willing to get into all of the nitty gritty of this really messed  
**[0:08:04-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:08:04):**  up system that we're living within.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:08:06):**  And so that was what about eight and a half years ago now.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:08:10):**  And from that point, that was, that was really the catalyst.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:08:16):**  That was the, that was the fire starter.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:08:21):**  And since then I have fallen deeply in love with the wilderness.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:08:26):**  I've gotten much more engaged with political activism in the realms of social, environmental  
**[0:08:33-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:08:33):**  and climate justice.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:08:35):**  And I moved out to this 500 acre plot of forest land that has previously been logged a few  
**[0:08:43-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:08:43):**  times, but has grown back really beautifully and have created a homestead, a community  
**[0:08:49-0:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:08:49):**  homestead and a nursery, a native species nursery out here.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:08:54):**  So that's a little bit of it.  
**[0:08:55-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:08:55):**  I tried to take the highlights of the past 30 years.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:09:00):**  So hopefully I was coherent.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:09:02):**  No, no, for sure.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:09:04):**  I can imagine that there were so many other events in there that, you know, we can't cover  
**[0:09:09-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:09:09):**  a one hour show, but that were pivotal to some of the decisions that you made.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:09:14):**  Now tell me kind of how this activism mindset and all of these informative experiences to  
**[0:09:21-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:09:21):**  you previously culminated into the decision to move out into the middle of the woods and  
**[0:09:26-0:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:09:26):**  how you found the place where you're living now.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:09:30):**  Well, I have to give a lot of credit to my partner March for that because we met at Occupy  
**[0:09:38-0:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:09:38):**  Wall Street and we fell in love in this really intense way where it was wrapped up in belief  
**[0:09:46-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:09:46):**  systems and just wanting to really understand the predicament we're in and be really aware  
**[0:09:56-0:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:09:56):**  and present and engaged with the issues.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:09:59):**  And so after Occupy went underground, after Homeland Security kicked us out of Zuccotti  
**[0:10:04-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:10:04):**  Park, March had lived in Peru for five years and I'd always wanted to go down to South  
**[0:10:11-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:10:11):**  America.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:10:12):**  So we during that winter went down to Patagonia and it was the first time I had camped and  
**[0:10:18-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:10:18):**  it was wild and it was rugged and I really fell in love with the wilderness.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:10:25):**  And so there was this colliding of worlds with the political activism mixed with this  
**[0:10:30-0:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:10:30):**  deep fascination and limerence with these wild places.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:10:37):**  And when we got back to New York City, which is where I was living, I was living in Manhattan,  
**[0:10:43-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:10:43):**  which is crazy to even say right now.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:10:45):**  I'm like, was I living in Manhattan?  
**[0:10:47-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:10:47):**  But I was living in Manhattan and March had said, let's move out to Oregon.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:10:52):**  And I was interested and I thought, okay, well, yeah, let's move out to Portland.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:10:58):**  And we looked at Portland and it was super cute city, but March ended up finding a cedar  
**[0:11:03-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:11:03):**  cabin in the mountains outside of the city that was surrounded by thousands of acres  
**[0:11:10-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:11:10):**  of timberland.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:11:12):**  And I was like, wait a minute, wait a minute.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:11:13):**  Like I thought we were moving to Portland.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:11:15):**  Like I don't know if I'm ready for this, but I took the leap of faith and we ended up moving  
**[0:11:20-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:11:20):**  out into this little cedar cabin and it had about seven acres of old growth forest surrounding  
**[0:11:29-0:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:11:29):**  the cabinet itself.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:11:30):**  But then it was like I said, thousands of acres of timberland.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:11:34):**  And that's when I really fell in love with the forest in a experiential way.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:11:41):**  It's when I started studying herbalism.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:11:43):**  And so I would go out into the forest and I would collect wild foods and wild medicine  
**[0:11:48-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:11:48):**  and work with them.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:11:50):**  It's also the time that I really got into homesteading in the sense of growing food,  
**[0:11:57-0:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:11:57):**  of making my own cleaner, my own dish cleaners, laundry cleaners, all that jazz.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:12:04):**  And it was the first time I had a food garden and that was really beautiful.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:12:08):**  I remember planting my first seeds and I was so nervous.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:12:12):**  I had the seeds in my hand and I was like, oh wait, do I put it down?  
**[0:12:16-0:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:12:16):**  How far do I put it down into the soil?  
**[0:12:18-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:12:18):**  And am I going to mess it up?  
**[0:12:20-0:12:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:12:20):**  And I still remember that really viscerally.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:12:24):**  So March and I had a little market farm.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:12:27):**  We grew I think 40 varieties of tomatoes in this really beautiful little patch in the  
**[0:12:35-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:12:35):**  woods that we used branches for the stakes.

**[0:12:43-0:12:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:12:43):**  And then we had, I think, gosh, maybe 40 to 50 varieties of heirloom lettuces.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:12:49):**  And so we were growing tomatoes, we were growing lettuce, we were growing a bunch of other

**[0:12:56-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:12:56):**  And then we would harvest our food and we'd make tomato sauce and handmade nettle pasta.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:13:04):**  And we'd go down to Portland and we built this really cute farm stand out of trees on

**[0:13:18-0:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:13:18):**  And so that was a hugely influential part of my life, just getting to work with my hands  
**[0:13:27-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:13:27):**  so much and getting to really stop buying certain things.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:13:34):**  Now I'm not to say I wasn't buying anything, you know, I was buying bulk flour, I was buying  
**[0:13:38-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:13:38):**  jars, lots and lots of jars.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:13:41):**  But I actually I remember us buying lots of jars from this guy on Craigslist who was Jim  
**[0:13:46-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:13:46):**  the jar guy and he collected jars.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:13:49):**  It was really, I thought I was like in an episode of a comedy when I went to go to his  
**[0:13:53-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:13:53):**  house.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:13:54):**  His house was literally just filled with jars to the ceiling.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:13:57):**  And so even then, like we were trying to not buy new things.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:14:03):**  And then, you know, Fukushima hit and I was so afraid of the nuclear fallout that was  
**[0:14:10-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:14:10):**  coming down in the rain in the temperate rainforest, which rained all the time.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:14:16):**  And I we decided to leave and go east and kind of gather our thoughts and our hearts.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:14:24):**  And I knew that I wanted to conserve land and I knew I wanted to really ground on land.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:14:33):**  And so we looked honestly, all over the place in the northeast of North America, we looked  
**[0:14:39-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:14:39):**  in New Zealand, we probably looked in a lot of other countries online.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:14:45):**  But then I found this place in Northern California that just really spoke to me.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:14:49):**  And honestly, I never thought I'd end up back in California.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:14:52):**  It's where I grew up.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:14:53):**  I grew up in Southern California, and I never wanted to live in California again.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:14:57):**  So it was shocking to me to even come back here.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:15:01):**  But I came Yeah, I moved here about five or six years ago.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:15:07):**  And and yeah, it was just logging land back at that point.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:15:14):**  There was roads, but that was the only human development was roads and big redwood stumps  
**[0:15:20-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:15:20):**  that had been logged in the past 100 years.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:15:23):**  And so what was this five, six years ago, we pitched our tent, no running water, no  
**[0:15:30-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:15:30):**  electricity, really had to strip my conditioning and my expectation and my entitlement to creature  
**[0:15:40-0:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:15:40):**  comforts, to modern conveniences to a fossil fuel lifestyle.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:15:45):**  And it was really hard and it was really emotional.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:15:48):**  And and, you know, honestly, even though I've done a lot of building on the land and gardening,  
**[0:15:56-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:15:56):**  I'm still in like kind of a half camp lifestyle, you know, we, we cook outside, we have it.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:16:05):**  I mean, if it's raining, we have a wood stove in this little cabin that we built that we  
**[0:16:10-0:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:16:10):**  cook on.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:16:11):**  But otherwise, we cook outside the kitchens all outside I haven't had refrigeration this  
**[0:16:17-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:16:17):**  whole time, we never will have refrigeration.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:16:20):**  We're totally off propane.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:16:22):**  So we cook with wood, we have bathtubs that we light fires underneath.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:16:27):**  So we heat water with wood.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:16:30):**  And the only time we use fossil fuels is in our generator.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:16:35):**  And that's if the solar doesn't give us what we need.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:16:38):**  And it's honestly because I have really shitty batteries.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:16:42):**  But if we had better batteries, which hopefully I'll get at some point, we probably won't  
**[0:16:48-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:16:48):**  even need to use the generator as much.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:16:49):**  So yeah, from Orange County to Manhattan to now doing everything with firewood, it's really  
**[0:16:57-0:17:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:16:57):**  been a huge, huge transition, but it's beautiful.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:17:03):**  And I love this life.

**[0:17:06-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:17:06):**  I have no desire to live in any other way.

**[0:17:24-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:17:24):**  And sometimes I get cold or sometimes I get hot or sometimes I have 100 bug bites on my

**[0:17:43-0:17:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:17:43):**  You know, we get in our car with air conditioning or heat, we get into our office with air conditioning

**[0:18:40-0:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:18:40):**  I still think that I would have been in love with this lifestyle.

**[0:19:09-0:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:19:09):**  Well, I don't know if decide is the right word.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:19:13):**  I think partially it's a decision to say, OK, you know, I'm not going to have all these

**[0:19:23-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:19:23):**  Because I think that for a lot of people, when things start getting taken away, they

**[0:19:28-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:19:28):**  They feel like they don't have a sense of security or safety because comfort, I think,

**[0:19:47-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:19:47):**  humans.

**[0:19:53-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:19:53):**  I just think it probably would have been emotionally more challenging because the time I had an  
**[0:19:57-0:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:19:57):**  organ was a beautiful in between.

**[0:20:02-0:20:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:20:02):**  Well, the heater didn't really work, but nonetheless, like I had a house with walls and a ceiling  
**[0:20:07-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:20:07):**  and I had a refrigeration and I had things I don't have now.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:20:12):**  And even after organ, I ended up moving out to Pennsylvania to an old farmhouse from the  
**[0:20:17-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:20:17):**  1700s.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:20:18):**  And so that similar, it was a bit similar to organ.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:20:21):**  It was rural living.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:20:23):**  It wasn't in the forest, though.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:20:24):**  It was I mean, there was some forest.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:20:26):**  It just wasn't similar in that way.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:20:27):**  But I think being able to have that softer in between was really helpful to be able to  
**[0:20:37-0:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:20:37):**  go that I don't know if it was a step further.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:20:40):**  There may have been like a whole staircase further into this lifestyle.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:20:44):**  But yeah, it's a good question.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:20:47):**  But like I said, I think ultimately, whether I had the in between or not, I think I still  
**[0:20:55-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:20:55):**  would have felt the same way I feel now, which is so grateful.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:21:01):**  So in love with this life and yeah, something that I feel really committed to.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:21:10):**  One of the things that I love that you talk about in your show and in some of the work  
**[0:21:14-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:21:14):**  of yours that I've seen is the emotional journeys that people are going through.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:21:19):**  I mean, certainly in a lot of other topics and a lot of other focuses, for example, in  
**[0:21:24-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:21:24):**  your podcast.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:21:25):**  Could you tell me a little bit about your personal emotional journey in making this  
**[0:21:29-0:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:21:29):**  transition?  
**[0:21:31-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:21:31):**  Not just the realization that you now have to do without some of the comforts that you  
**[0:21:37-0:21:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:21:37):**  were used to or that your scheduling and your time investments are going to be very different,  
**[0:21:42-0:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:21:42):**  but also just kind of how it's affected you and your sense of identity and connection  
**[0:21:48-0:21:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:21:48):**  to nature in this process.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:21:50):**  Gosh, yeah.  
**[0:21:53-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:21:53):**  So my identity, I'd say, has shifted so much in the past decade because I used to really  
**[0:22:04-0:22:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:22:04):**  identify as a city person and I loved the metropolitan lifestyle.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:22:10):**  I loved living in New York City and getting dressed up and going out on the town and eating  
**[0:22:17-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:22:17):**  at restaurants.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:22:18):**  And there was a lot that was wrapped up in my ego of being sexy or having attention in  
**[0:22:29-0:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:22:29):**  that way or feeling like I wanted to flirt or go to an event that I felt was cool or  
**[0:22:35-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:22:35):**  hip or something.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:22:36):**  And so I, in a lot of ways, I love that.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:22:40):**  In a lot of ways, though, I felt extremely unfulfilled.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:22:42):**  It felt shallow.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:22:44):**  You know, there was always that feeling that getting ready to go out was more fun than  
**[0:22:48-0:22:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:22:48):**  actually going out because once I was out, I kind of wanted to just come home.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:22:52):**  But there's a lot wrapped up in the ego that it's like, yeah, I want to go out.  
**[0:22:56-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:22:56):**  I want to feel cute.  
**[0:22:57-0:22:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:22:57):**  I want to paint the town red.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:22:59):**  I want to go shopping or whatever it was.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:23:04):**  And there was parts of me that, like I said, felt like I liked that, although I felt this  
**[0:23:10-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:23:10):**  also this kind of underneath underlying really chronic dissatisfaction with that lifestyle.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:23:18):**  And I think the other part of why that lifestyle felt so unfulfilling to me is because it wasn't  
**[0:23:24-0:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:23:24):**  about being in service.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:23:26):**  It wasn't about serving the forest, serving the earth, serving the communities.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:23:31):**  It was really just about me, my ego and how to feed that.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:23:37):**  And that, like I said, it just didn't feel it didn't feel good ultimately.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:23:44):**  Now living out here and having my identity be wrapped up as a forest dweller, as somebody  
**[0:23:51-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:23:51):**  who's very close with the land, as somebody who listens to the land, as somebody who has  
**[0:23:57-0:24:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:23:57):**  and have a jolly good life with your chickens and have a good family life, maybe.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:24:04):**  But does that mean that you're going out and you're learning what's happening in your area  
**[0:24:07-0:24:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:24:07):**  and you're giving your energy towards making sure that your neighborhood or your farm or  
**[0:24:14-0:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:24:14):**  whatever isn't being polluted by industry or people are being taken care of?  
**[0:24:21-0:24:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:24:21):**  That's really another level that matters to me a lot.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:24:25):**  And so having my identity wrapped up as activist, forest dweller, forest defender, land defender,  
**[0:24:34-0:24:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:24:34):**  you know, because in a lot of ways I don't actually identify as a homesteader.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:24:37):**  I don't get interviewed a lot about my personal lifestyle.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:24:42):**  And I don't think about myself as that.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:24:45):**  That's not what I identify as first.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:24:47):**  But it's fun to talk about it because in a lot of ways, my identity is wrapped up in  
**[0:24:53-0:25:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:24:53):**  living like this and being so grateful for turning on a tap with water because I actually,  
**[0:25:01-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:25:01):**  you know, I actually was the one who put the pipe in the spring and laid the line down  
**[0:25:06-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:25:06):**  to get here.

**[0:28:42-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:28:42):**  It's not those things that I'm missing don't outweigh the things that I have gained from

**[0:28:54-0:28:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:28:54):**  It doesn't fulfill every single part of me.

**[0:29:05-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:29:05):**  No, they're not super important.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:29:07):**  But yeah, those are still parts of me that I don't get to nourish in the same ways.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:29:12):**  But the other part too, is like the time we're living in, we don't get everything.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:29:17):**  We don't get to have our cake and eat it too.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:29:18):**  And even though I know, especially for many people in the United States, we've been conditioned  
**[0:29:24-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:29:24):**  to believe that we can have everything.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:29:28):**  I think that feeling that entitlement, and I think the endless amount of options are  
**[0:29:34-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:29:34):**  actually really detrimental to us, and the way we end up treating each other and the  
**[0:29:38-0:29:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:29:38):**  earth.

**[0:29:41-0:29:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:29:41):**  I'm okay not having everything.

**[0:29:53-0:30:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:29:53):**  Tell me a little about the challenges that you thought you were going to face in changing

**[0:30:37-0:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:30:37):**  And people have certain expectations about what perhaps your lifestyle would entail,  
**[0:30:44-0:30:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:30:44):**  and maybe you thought these things too before living it yourself.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:30:46):**  And how did those expectations meet up with the reality that is your day-to-day life now?  
**[0:30:52-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:30:52):**  Mm-hmm, great question.

**[0:31:03-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:31:03):**  because of Instagram and social media.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:31:07):**  I could take a framed shot of my cast iron on the fire and it could be like, ooh, look

**[0:31:19-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:31:19):**  And I think a lot of people are attracted to the marketing aspects of this lifestyle  
**[0:31:26-0:31:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:31:26):**  or the things that just look really good.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:31:29):**  But it's also really hard.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:31:31):**  It takes time to go into the woods and find the tree that has fallen down and cut it up  
**[0:31:41-0:31:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:31:41):**  and take it back down to the homestead and chop it and chop it and chop it again and  
**[0:31:46-0:31:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:31:46):**  get it to be the right and then make sure the kindling is dry.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:31:49):**  And there's all these pieces to it that I think don't get expressed in the same ways  
**[0:31:56-0:32:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:31:56):**  because people just see like a little glimpse into it and it looks great.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:32:04):**  And it is great.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:32:05):**  It's absolutely great.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:32:06):**  But I think that there's an expectation or maybe just a not knowing of all the details  
**[0:32:13-0:32:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:32:13):**  and all the work and the time that it actually takes to live like this.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:32:17):**  Now, of course, I don't think that that's what am I trying to say here?  
**[0:32:24-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:32:24):**  It's hard to know every detail before you do things.

**[0:32:35-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:32:35):**  I need to experience things in order to understand them more fully rather than just reading them  
**[0:32:39-0:32:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:32:39):**  or being told what it takes.

**[0:32:46-0:32:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:32:46):**  going to be so cold.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:32:47):**  And I was like, oh, yeah, yeah, I'll be okay.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:32:49):**  And then there were those nights when I'm like, oh, my gosh, I'm so damn cold.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:32:53):**  This is really hard.  
**[0:32:56-0:33:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:32:56):**  But I had to actually be in it.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:33:06):**  I don't know if I really had expectations so much.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:33:11):**  I'm trying to remember what they could have been.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:33:13):**  I do remember when I first got here, I had interviewed Steven Harrod Buhner, who's a  
**[0:33:19-0:33:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:33:19):**  really wonderful herbalist and earth poet, a number of years ago.  
**[0:33:24-0:33:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:33:24):**  And he was kind of saying something in this episode of the journey of self-discovery.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:33:31):**  Like you'll lose everything once you enter the journey of self-discovery.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:33:36):**  And he said something else like he was talking about something about welcoming the demons  
**[0:33:40-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:33:40):**  in.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:33:41):**  And I don't know why that inspired me.  
**[0:33:43-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:33:43):**  But when I got out here, I literally said demons welcome here, like in my body.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:33:48):**  And I was really willing to just be thrashed and stripped down.  
**[0:33:55-0:34:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:33:55):**  And I wanted to extract all of that, that, that I don't know what you call it, like that  
**[0:34:05-0:34:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:34:05):**  type of energy out of me.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:34:06):**  I wanted to really see it.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:34:09):**  I want to look straight at it and, and, and be able to extract it and get it out of my  
**[0:34:17-0:34:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:34:17):**  body.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:34:18):**  And so there was that expectation that I would do that work, which I did.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:34:22):**  Now I didn't, I don't know if I understood how shitty it would feel at times.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:34:28):**  You know, maybe I didn't like fully know what I was getting myself into when I said those  
**[0:34:32-0:34:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:34:32):**  things when I moved out here when I was just willing to be so raw and challenged.  
**[0:34:39-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:34:39):**  Because a lot of times I will ask for the challenge, but then actually being in the  
**[0:34:43-0:34:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:34:43):**  challenge is a whole other can of worms.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:34:46):**  So yeah, it's, I don't know, like if I, I mean, there's expectations like things.  
**[0:34:56-0:35:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:34:56):**  I built ponds, for instance, and I was told that the ponds would hold water and a couple  
**[0:35:03-0:35:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:35:03):**  of them aren't holding water.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:35:04):**  So that expectation was not met and it's extremely frustrating and I'm trying to figure out ways  
**[0:35:11-0:35:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:35:11):**  to have the ponds hold water.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:35:13):**  So there's expectations like that, that I can be really clear about.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:35:16):**  And I was building up the homestead and I thought things would go a certain way with  
**[0:35:20-0:35:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:35:20):**  building projects or gardening projects.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:35:22):**  And then I realized, Oh, actually there's a lot more steps to this process or Oh, actually  
**[0:35:27-0:35:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:35:27):**  this is going to take a decade.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:35:29):**  It's not going to take a season.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:35:31):**  And so things like that.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:35:32):**  So maybe like the expectation of just time and knowing that knowing at this point that  
**[0:35:40-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:35:40):**  things take a lot more time than they do in the modern city world.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:35:45):**  You know, I can't have anything delivered to my, well, I guess I could have mail, but  
**[0:35:50-0:35:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:35:50):**  like in terms of other things delivered, like that's not going to happen or or just, yeah,  
**[0:35:57-0:36:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:35:57):**  the, the quick paceness, like things take time, takes way longer than I even expect  
**[0:36:03-0:36:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:36:03):**  them to take.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:36:04):**  It takes many more steps that I expect it to take.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:36:07):**  A lot of times I'll look out and I'll think, Oh, this should be a very simple project.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:36:12):**  And then six hours later I haven't even gotten 2% of it done, even though I've been puffing  
**[0:36:17-0:36:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:36:17):**  and puffing.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:36:18):**  So it's, yeah, it's really, that has again humbled me and it has put me on a timescale  
**[0:36:25-0:36:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:36:25):**  of earth time because working with the land takes me back into earth time.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:36:29):**  It's not computer time.  
**[0:36:31-0:36:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:36:31):**  It's not technological time.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:36:32):**  It's not, it's not city time or suburb time or it's really like the land moves slower.  
**[0:36:43-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:36:43):**  And how do I learn to move slower with the land and not expect the land to give me everything  
**[0:36:49-0:36:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:36:49):**  I want immediately and to feed that desire for instant gratification because I think  
**[0:36:55-0:36:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:36:55):**  that is the gratification desire is part of the addiction to fossil fuels.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:36:59):**  Part of the greed is part of the way to go mind virus.

**[0:37:12-0:37:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:37:12):**  community that live off the land as well.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:37:14):**  They're, you know, it's funny.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:37:18):**  There's yeah, there's just a knowing that there's things are never done and you always  
**[0:37:25-0:37:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:37:25):**  have to work on them your whole life and you'll die and things still won't be done.

**[0:37:31-0:37:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:37:31):**  And I think there's a lot of working with living systems.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:37:35):**  They're inherently unfinished.

**[0:37:46-0:37:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:37:46):**  and that's definitely been a part of my own experience too in the chances that I've had  
**[0:37:51-0:37:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:37:51):**  to live very close to the land and adapt to, like you said, earth time is it really comes  
**[0:37:58-0:38:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:37:58):**  down to your expectations of it.

**[0:38:07-0:38:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:38:07):**  to our expectations and not manage our expectations in relationship to what is happening around

**[0:38:27-0:38:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:38:27):**  more when we learn to work with its rhythms and adapt our expectations, like I was saying,  
**[0:38:35-0:38:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:38:35):**  to what is actually going on.

**[0:38:51-0:38:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:38:51):**  They need to be adapted and they need to be understood as coming from us and not being

**[0:39:02-0:39:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:39:02):**  Yeah.

**[0:39:14-0:39:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:39:14):**  or not, or in a home setting lifestyle or not.

**[0:39:31-0:39:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:39:31):**  Like the earth is not here to serve us all the time.  
**[0:39:34-0:39:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:39:34):**  You know, we take advantage of the earth so much and just expect the earth to do everything  
**[0:39:39-0:39:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:39:39):**  we want, rather than trying to ask, how can we serve the earth?  
**[0:39:44-0:39:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:39:44):**  How can we show up for these living systems and fulfill their needs and desires rather  
**[0:39:53-0:39:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:39:53):**  than vice versa?  
**[0:39:55-0:39:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:39:55):**  Because if we fulfill the earth's needs, we're going to be fed, we're going to be met, we're  
**[0:39:59-0:40:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:39:59):**  going to be most of the time taken care of, if we can actually listen to what the earth  
**[0:40:06-0:40:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:40:06):**  is meeting in order to be abundant.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:40:09):**  But we don't do that anymore.  
**[0:40:11-0:40:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:40:11):**  And so it's just very, we've gotten into a very selfish cycle with our human desires.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:40:18):**  And in a way I understand it, we're animals and we want to survive.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:40:23):**  And it makes sense that we think about ourselves and our needs and our wants.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:40:30):**  But I do think that as intelligent beings, we need to really consider what we're asking  
**[0:40:40-0:40:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:40:40):**  of the earth and how that is going to not only affect the earth, but eventually affect  
**[0:40:46-0:40:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:40:46):**  us, which is definitely what we're seeing now.  
**[0:40:49-0:40:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:40:49):**  Indeed.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:40:50):**  Yeah, I couldn't agree more.  
**[0:40:52-0:40:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:40:52):**  Now, I want to go back to one thing that you said when I asked you a little bit about how  
**[0:40:56-0:41:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:40:56):**  you have changed your personal identification to match this lifestyle and the setting in  
**[0:41:01-0:41:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:41:01):**  which you live and how you mentioned that it's actually kind of a secondary identification  
**[0:41:06-0:41:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:41:06):**  for you.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:41:07):**  Can you talk a little bit about what you identify most with and how that relates to your work?  
**[0:41:11-0:41:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:41:11):**  Because you've already talked about how it relates to your lifestyle.  
**[0:41:16-0:41:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:41:16):**  Yeah, I would say that, well, first I'll say like, I don't really ever think about my identity  
**[0:41:25-0:41:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:41:25):**  in that way.  
**[0:41:29-0:41:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:41:29):**  I guess I'm kind of more fluid in a sense of just being alive and being in service.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:41:36):**  And so I hardly categorize myself in that term.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:41:44):**  But I have said before, and I feel like I can stand behind identifying as a lover and  
**[0:41:51-0:42:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:41:51):**  a relative of this earth, I feel very strongly in identifying relationally with the land  
**[0:42:01-0:42:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:42:01):**  and feeling like I am a mother, daughter, aunt, wife, lover, I'm that.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:42:15):**  That's what I can identify as.  
**[0:42:17-0:42:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:42:17):**  I am in a relationship with this planet and I'm in a relationship to the land.  
**[0:42:22-0:42:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:42:22):**  I'm in relationship to the soil.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:42:25):**  And all of that takes so much tending and attention and tenderness and dedication and  
**[0:42:33-0:42:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:42:33):**  commitment.  
**[0:42:35-0:42:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:42:35):**  And I can identify as a very committed, I'm in a very committed relationship and I can  
**[0:42:40-0:42:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:42:40):**  identify as a partner and a lover in that.  
**[0:42:45-0:42:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:42:45):**  And I feel so good about that identification.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:42:49):**  So I don't know if that answers your question.  
**[0:42:53-0:42:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:42:53):**  It does.  
**[0:42:54-0:42:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:42:54):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:55-0:43:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:42:55):**  I think it has a different way and motivation that brings about these big changes like we've  
**[0:43:00-0:43:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:43:00):**  been talking about up until now.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:43:02):**  And yeah, it's great to hear kind of how you identify within that.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:43:08):**  A topic that you explore a lot and that you've delved deep into in some of your other work  
**[0:43:14-0:43:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:43:14):**  is the concept of reindigenization and rewilding.  
**[0:43:19-0:43:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:43:19):**  And you've had the privilege, as have I on this show, of talking with people much more  
**[0:43:23-0:43:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:43:23):**  prepared to answer good questions and explain this concept than perhaps even you or I.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:43:29):**  But how has exploring this topic kind of informed your interaction with the setting that you  
**[0:43:35-0:43:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:43:35):**  live in and the way that you live your life?  
**[0:43:39-0:43:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:43:39):**  Well, yeah.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:43:44):**  I don't identify as being indigenous, especially not to Turtle Island.  
**[0:43:51-0:43:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:43:51):**  At one time, of course, my ancestors were indigenous to land.  
**[0:43:56-0:44:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:43:56):**  And from what I can tell, it's mainly the lands of what is now Russia.  
**[0:44:05-0:44:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:44:05):**  And so I'm careful in how I speak about reindigenizing because there are indigenous people who are  
**[0:44:16-0:44:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:44:16):**  still very much here and present and leaders.  
**[0:44:22-0:44:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:44:22):**  And they need that respect that they are still here and connected to their indigenous ways

**[0:44:45-0:44:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:44:45):**  We came literally from this earth.  
**[0:44:48-0:44:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:44:48):**  And so I think that remembering that we are not disconnected.  
**[0:44:54-0:44:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:44:54):**  We didn't just plop out of the sky.  
**[0:44:57-0:45:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:44:57):**  And as we are babies, we have a long lineage of being human and having our human ancestors  
**[0:45:04-0:45:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:45:04):**  rely upon the land and the creatures and the waters.  
**[0:45:08-0:45:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:45:08):**  And that's the only way that we're here.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:45:09):**  We are here because our ancestors tended the earth and were able to tend it in a way that

**[0:45:21-0:45:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:45:21):**  So I think there's a point there.  
**[0:45:25-0:45:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:45:25):**  And in terms of the rewilding, originally the podcast that I host was called Unlearn  
**[0:45:30-0:45:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:45:30):**  and Rewild.  
**[0:45:31-0:45:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:45:31):**  And I've talked about the unlearning and the deconditioning.  
**[0:45:34-0:45:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:45:34):**  And the rewilding has been important for me to get out of that modern conditioning of

**[0:45:59-0:46:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:45:59):**  Really keep the system propped and pretend like you enjoy it.  
**[0:46:05-0:46:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:46:05):**  It's like, no, most of us don't enjoy continuing to prop the system up.  
**[0:46:09-0:46:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:46:09):**  We actually hate it.  
**[0:46:11-0:46:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:46:11):**  And rewilding, I think psychologically is moving away from that conditioning, really  
**[0:46:17-0:46:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:46:17):**  questioning ambition, questioning success, questioning everything that this system has  
**[0:46:24-0:46:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:46:24):**  been built upon, consumer capitalism, colonialism, imperialism, control.

**[0:46:37-0:46:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:46:37):**  supremacy and realizing humans are not at the top of the triangle.  
**[0:46:42-0:46:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:46:42):**  Humans are not necessary for this earth to thrive.

**[0:46:49-0:46:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:46:49):**  We are not the most powerful.  
**[0:46:50-0:46:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:46:50):**  We are not the most intelligent.  
**[0:46:54-0:46:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:46:54):**  We are part of a much bigger system and that system is wild.  
**[0:46:58-0:47:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:46:58):**  And to me, what wild is, is having autonomy and liberation to live out our destinies or  
**[0:47:06-0:47:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:47:06):**  to live out our lives in a way that isn't so confined by a system that we didn't agree  
**[0:47:13-0:47:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:47:13):**  to even.

**[0:47:22-0:47:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:47:22):**  but again, like I really want to say, I think it's more psychological to break the chains  
**[0:47:27-0:47:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:47:27):**  of domestication and to break the chains of this consumer lifestyle that we have been

**[0:47:41-0:47:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:47:41):**  we are not happy.

**[0:47:50-0:47:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:47:50):**  connection, love, affection, anything like that.  
**[0:47:55-0:47:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:47:55):**  It's not getting us there.

**[0:47:58-0:48:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:47:58):**  Okay, so we're getting, you know, of course, like being able to pay for a home and food  
**[0:48:03-0:48:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:48:03):**  on the table and medicine, that's all important, but to make money just to buy more stuff,

**[0:48:20-0:48:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/from-manhattan-to-the-redwood-forest-an-inner-journey-of-rewilding-with-ayana-young-of-for-the-wild/#t=0:48:20):**  It doesn't make sense.

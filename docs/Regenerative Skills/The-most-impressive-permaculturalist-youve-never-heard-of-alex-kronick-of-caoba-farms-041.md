**[0:00:05-0:00:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:00:05):**  permaculture, natural building, and regenerative living.  
**[0:00:08-0:00:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:00:08):**  As always, I'm your host, Oliver Gaucher, and I have a fantastic interview for you in

**[0:01:23-0:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:01:23):**  go beyond sustainability.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:01:25):**  Alright, I have an unusual interview with you all today since I actually won't be the  
**[0:01:28-0:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:01:28):**  one conducting the interview.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:01:30):**  Instead, Neil Haggerty, one of the lead designers and team members here at Abundant Edge, will  
**[0:01:35-0:01:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:01:35):**  be taking the reins since he's actually known Alex Kronick of Kuoba Farms in Antigua, Guatemala  
**[0:01:40-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:01:40):**  for years and is good friends with him.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:01:42):**  Now I call Alex the most impressive permaculture list you've never heard of because he likes  
**[0:01:47-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:01:47):**  to keep a low profile, but to his credit, his farm and enterprises are truly impressive.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:01:52):**  He co-manages an incredibly diverse biointensive market garden within the town that also has  
**[0:01:57-0:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:01:57):**  a farm-to-table restaurant, farmer's market, and local organics goods store.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:02:03):**  Around the peripheries of the farm, he raises many varieties of animals, fruit trees, perennial  
**[0:02:07-0:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:02:07):**  crops, and even makes his own Bokashi composting.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:02:10):**  He raises snails and has an exotic plant nursery and even a seed saving operation.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:02:15):**  It's the most complete and functional permaculture operation that I've seen anywhere in the world,  
**[0:02:19-0:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:02:19):**  and I've visited quite a few.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:02:21):**  But before I give anything away, let me hand things over to Neil to give us a rundown of  
**[0:02:25-0:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:02:25):**  the interview.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:02:26):**  All right, I'm here with my good friend and colleague Neil Haggerty.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:02:30):**  He's agreed to do the interview because he's also good friends with Alex Kronick, the interviewee  
**[0:02:35-0:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:02:35):**  in this episode.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:02:37):**  So Neil, tell us a little bit about what you guys talked about in this session.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:02:41):**  Yeah, well I was really excited to interview Alex.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:02:45):**  We've been friends for a long time.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:02:46):**  I've been in Guatemala going on four years now and I've known Alex for a good bit of  
**[0:02:50-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:02:50):**  time.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:02:51):**  I stopped by Cooba Farms when I was doing research for my thesis.  
**[0:02:56-0:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:02:56):**  And it's a great urban market garden.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:02:59):**  The place is just thriving.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:03:02):**  It's not just a great market garden.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:03:04):**  It also has really cool permaculture features.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:03:07):**  It has a whole wild area around the borders.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:03:12):**  Alex is a very passionate plant collector.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:03:16):**  So he runs a nursery with all kinds of exotic plants in it.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:03:20):**  Very interesting guy.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:03:21):**  So we just talked about, he actually started talking a lot about the challenges of market  
**[0:03:27-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:03:27):**  gardening, particularly in Guatemala where there wasn't a history or a culture of eating  
**[0:03:33-0:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:03:33):**  organic food.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:03:35):**  So the start of the interview almost sounds kind of discouraging because he talked a lot  
**[0:03:41-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:03:41):**  about the problems he had.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:03:44):**  But if you stick with the interview, the more technical information comes at around the  
**[0:03:49-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:03:49):**  20 minute mark about how to actually get started.  
**[0:03:56-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:03:56):**  But it's worth listening to.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:03:58):**  Alex tells his story of coming back from the States.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:04:01):**  He's Guatemalan.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:04:02):**  He's half Guatemalan, half American.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:04:04):**  And he went to college in the States.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:04:09):**  And he talks about coming back and starting from scratch, growing lettuce and realizing  
**[0:04:16-0:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:04:16):**  that there was no organic lettuce to make Caesar salads in the restaurants.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:04:21):**  So starting with lettuce and then going to rock it and how he went from there to now  
**[0:04:25-0:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:04:25):**  being the owner of what's certainly the most well known organic farm in Guatemala and beyond  
**[0:04:34-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:04:34):**  to his future plans for this huge piece of land that he's bought and all the plans he  
**[0:04:38-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:04:38):**  has for that.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:04:40):**  So interesting interview.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:04:42):**  Yeah, very inspiring guy and there's also a lot of things that we'll link to in the  
**[0:04:46-0:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:04:46):**  show notes after this.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:04:48):**  And Neil as well, if people want to know more about you, if they hadn't heard from you from  
**[0:04:52-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:04:52):**  before, you can check out the interview that I did with Neil a couple of episodes back.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:04:57):**  And yeah, let's hand it over to you and Alex Kronik.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:05:01):**  All right, Alex.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:05:02):**  So listen, thanks a million for joining us on the Abundant Edge website.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:05:08):**  This is actually my first interview and I'm glad to be interviewing my good friend Alex  
**[0:05:14-0:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:05:14):**  Kronik, the owner of of Coalba Farms and a lot of other initiatives here in Guatemala.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:05:22):**  So Alex, why don't you just start and tell us a little bit about yourself and some of  
**[0:05:27-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:05:27):**  the enterprises you're involved in.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:05:29):**  Okay.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:05:31):**  I'm 36 years old.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:05:37):**  I consider myself married, but I'm really not married.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:05:40):**  You know, I just live with my partner since long, long ago.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:05:45):**  I love farming in many ways.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:05:48):**  I love business, I love solving problems and helping community.  
**[0:05:54-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:05:54):**  And what I do kind of tangles up everything I just mentioned.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:06:01):**  With that comes a lot of stress, which I'm trying to manage.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:06:03):**  That's my biggest concern.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:06:05):**  I've been overthinking things, never have time for myself really.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:06:09):**  It seems like I always have time for everybody else's.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:06:14):**  And I'm trying to work on that.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:06:17):**  But what definitely comes me down is being in nature, in the farm and not having to deal  
**[0:06:22-0:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:06:22):**  with anybody.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:06:24):**  Yeah, that's an interesting one.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:06:27):**  That's an interesting one about not leaving time for yourself.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:06:33):**  I feel that's actually pretty common in the sort of permaculture world.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:06:37):**  People get very passionate about what they do.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:06:40):**  But then they kind of sort of forget that the whole point was just to be kicking it  
**[0:06:45-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:06:45):**  on a nice farm in nature and relaxing, not working all the time.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:06:49):**  Well, you know, the principle number one of permaculture is get a yield.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:06:54):**  And with a yield comes business.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:06:56):**  And with business, it's for business.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:07:01):**  And therefore, before you know it, you're tangled in business and you're not enjoying  
**[0:07:05-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:07:05):**  your farm.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:07:06):**  Yeah, it's true.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:07:07):**  But this, all right.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:07:08):**  So listen, why don't you tell me, I mean, I think the thing you're most known for around  
**[0:07:14-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:07:14):**  Antigua is co-op farms.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:07:16):**  So why don't you tell me a little bit about like co-op farms, how it got started in it  
**[0:07:21-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:07:21):**  and how you got into it and what it turned into.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:07:27):**  Okay.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:07:28):**  So about 14 years ago, I was in college in Northern California in a private small college  
**[0:07:37-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:07:37):**  called Sierra Nevada College.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:07:39):**  It's in Lake Tahoe on the Nevada side.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:07:44):**  And it's a well-known school for international business and entrepreneurship, environmental  
**[0:07:50-0:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:07:50):**  science and ceramics, I don't know about everything else.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:07:53):**  So I have a degree in entrepreneurship and I have a degree in ceramics.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:07:59):**  But I got a minor, I don't have a full degree, I have a minor on ceramics.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:08:05):**  And basically, I had to do a thesis and part of the thesis on entrepreneurship was basically  
**[0:08:12-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:08:12):**  coming up with an idea, turning it into business and presenting it to some venture capitalist  
**[0:08:17-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:08:17):**  and see if you got lucky and you get funded and there you go, you're part of society.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:08:23):**  But everybody loved the idea I was gonna have but no one wanted to invest in Guatemala.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:08:29):**  So it didn't really work out for me.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:08:32):**  That idea was to start a farm here in Antigua, Guatemala where I was gonna grow produce,  
**[0:08:40-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:08:40):**  not necessarily organic because 14 years ago, organic wasn't really that trendy.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:08:47):**  But I always did the organic but the idea was to start with exotic products you weren't  
**[0:08:52-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:08:52):**  able to find here locally because the scene, the culinary scene was starting to grow and  
**[0:08:58-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:08:58):**  expand but what's about a good culinary chef and a good culinary scene and you can't get  
**[0:09:03-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:09:03):**  culinary items, right?  
**[0:09:05-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:09:05):**  So I was like, I got the land from family members that had it abandoned and the idea  
**[0:09:14-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:09:14):**  was to grow products that you couldn't find in your local grocery store here or the local  
**[0:09:19-0:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:09:19):**  market which was mostly where everybody bought stuff.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:09:22):**  And the two things I saw that were needed for the restaurants around was romaine lettuce  
**[0:09:28-0:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:09:28):**  since I got the idea because I went to a fine restaurant and I ordered a Caesar salad and  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:09:34):**  I got iceberg lettuce and I was like, this can't be.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:09:39):**  I mean, I was like, no way a Caesar salad is with iceberg and where's my crunchy rib  
**[0:09:46-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:09:46):**  romaine, you know, that's exactly what you're looking for.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:09:50):**  And then I started doing a little bit more research and no, you couldn't really find  
**[0:09:53-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:09:53):**  romaine lettuce in all Guatemala.  
**[0:09:54-0:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:09:54):**  I mean, there was, you just couldn't find it.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:09:58):**  So that was the reason they were using either yellow leaf or iceberg lettuce or romaine  
**[0:10:04-0:10:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:10:04):**  salads and I was like, oh my gosh, there's, that's a potential.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:10:08):**  Then I started going and I went to like maybe four or five different fancy restaurants and  
**[0:10:12-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:10:12):**  sure enough, all like four out of the five had a Caesar salad with a Caesar dressing,  
**[0:10:19-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:10:19):**  but no romaine.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:10:20):**  It was all iceberg.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:10:23):**  So I was like, I was like, there is, there's one for you.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:10:26):**  So I'm going to grow romaine lettuce for restaurants.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:10:29):**  And that was my first item that I started growing.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:10:33):**  So I grew it for them.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:10:35):**  They were very happy.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:10:36):**  And before you know it, they told another restaurant that, hey, now we can find romaine  
**[0:10:41-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:10:41):**  lettuce.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:10:42):**  And I started growing romaine lettuce for the second restaurant.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:10:45):**  The third restaurant I started to was an Italian restaurant and sure enough, they were interested  
**[0:10:52-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:10:52):**  in the romaine lettuce, even though I don't know how much romaine lettuce is part of Italian  
**[0:10:56-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:10:56):**  cuisine, but they were interested in it.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:10:59):**  But with that came the thought that they were like, where's the arugula?  
**[0:11:03-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:11:03):**  We need arugula for, you know, our salads and pizzas and bruschettas and whatever they  
**[0:11:10-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:11:10):**  make, which they want arugula.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:11:12):**  So I was like, you know what?  
**[0:11:14-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:11:14):**  You're right.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:11:15):**  There's no arugula.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:11:16):**  So then I started counting how many Italian restaurants were Italian.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:11:17):**  There was like three or four and I knew there was like 10 or 15 in the city, which were  
**[0:11:22-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:11:22):**  like kind of not fast food chain Italian.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:11:24):**  They were like fancy Italian.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:11:25):**  So I knew there was a potential to grow arugula.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:11:29):**  And so that was my second item.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:11:32):**  And then with the same Italian movement came the Italian basil.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:11:40):**  That was my third product.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:11:44):**  You could not do a decent pesto and a decent capressa because they were using the local  
**[0:11:50-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:11:50):**  basil, which is good, but it's not, you know, the Italian one that you can recognize through  
**[0:12:00-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:12:00):**  international.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:12:01):**  And the sweet basil you mean?  
**[0:12:02-0:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:12:02):**  Yeah, the sweet basil, which is like the Genovese, you know, like the Genovese basil.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:12:06):**  And so, you know, people who don't know, well, who cares?  
**[0:12:10-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:12:10):**  But you know, the more and more they were trying to open up the culinary scene and more  
**[0:12:13-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:12:13):**  international people come in and if you can't keep up with their taste and they don't think  
**[0:12:19-0:12:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:12:19):**  it's that good, you know, or they don't meet the standards.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:12:22):**  So that was the third item.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:12:23):**  And before you knew it, I was working with 10 restaurants.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:12:25):**  Then I went to the city and then slowly started getting more items.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:12:29):**  And I always grew it organically because I was eating it myself and everything, but I  
**[0:12:33-0:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:12:33):**  never really marketed it as an organic product because it wasn't really popular to market  
**[0:12:40-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:12:40):**  it.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:12:41):**  I knew people wouldn't even pay for it.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:12:42):**  I mean, the scene in the States wasn't even started by then.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:12:44):**  I mean, the organic scene started like in 2008 really strong.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:12:48):**  I mean, it did exist, but it didn't really get going till picking up till like 2008 and  
**[0:12:54-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:12:54):**  with like Trader Joe's and Whole Foods and all that.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:12:58):**  And in 2004 when I started 14 years ago, I mean, Trader Joe's was out there, but it wasn't  
**[0:13:04-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:13:04):**  that big of a company as it is today.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:13:06):**  You know, it's not the really famous.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:13:08):**  Right.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:13:09):**  So just to stop you there, like were you then, were you motivated to grow it organically  
**[0:13:14-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:13:14):**  because it was more efficient?  
**[0:13:17-0:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:13:17):**  Was there like an, what was the...  
**[0:13:19-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:13:19):**  No, I know.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:13:20):**  Not at all.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:13:21):**  Not at all.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:13:22):**  I was motivated to grow organic because I was eating it myself and my family was eating  
**[0:13:28-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:13:28):**  it.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:13:29):**  And I never really liked the idea of chemicals and all that, but it's a lot harder.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:13:34):**  I never thought, I mean, the easy thing would be just to, you know, do traditional work,  
**[0:13:38-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:13:38):**  one or two items and mass produce it and grow chemicals.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:13:42):**  And that'd be the business part of it.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:13:44):**  But in Guatemala, things when you do something and people see it works, they start catching  
**[0:13:50-0:13:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:13:50):**  on and then they start copying it.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:13:52):**  There's always someone with more money and more things.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:13:54):**  And so I figured, you know, stick to quality and not quantity.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:13:58):**  So that's kind of, was my model from the beginning.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:14:02):**  And you know, it's like, there's a reason why the Germans are still doing good and the  
**[0:14:09-0:14:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:14:09):**  Japanese are still doing good because the Chinese can't do what they do.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:14:13):**  You know, you can't compete with the low end because they'll kill you.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:14:16):**  You know, so you know, if I'm sure enough nowadays there's 50 different companies that  
**[0:14:23-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:14:23):**  do what I do, but you know, they work on one or two items, mass produce it, cheap chemicals.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:14:27):**  And yeah, it looks great.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:14:29):**  It's packaged great.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:14:30):**  They probably have a good service, but the quality is not there.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:14:33):**  You know, it's not organic because it's hard to do that.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:14:36):**  And nowadays if there is organic, you know, what's the next step of organic is, you know,  
**[0:14:42-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:14:42):**  what I'm trying to promote nowadays is what I tell people all the time is that there's  
**[0:14:47-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:14:47):**  a difference between organic agriculture and organic products, which is what people have  
**[0:14:53-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:14:53):**  tended to focus on because there's a lot of money in organic.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:14:56):**  So you know, just to, just to bring you back there a second, Alex, because it's like, it's  
**[0:15:02-0:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:15:02):**  interesting if someone didn't know Koaba Farms to hear you talk about there, it's small,  
**[0:15:07-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:15:07):**  like you went from producing two types of lettuce and arugula organically to know having  
**[0:15:15-0:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:15:15):**  like this really, really impressive organic farm that has been in the first two years,  
**[0:15:22-0:15:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:15:22):**  you know, that was probably within the first two years.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:15:24):**  So we're talking 2006, you know, that the organic movement still hasn't picked up.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:15:29):**  But what's starting to happen is before organic stuff starts picking up is I'm having difficulty  
**[0:15:35-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:15:35):**  finding seeds.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:15:36):**  I'm having difficulty finding seeds because I have to sneak them in from the States.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:15:40):**  I do somehow, you know, it's really impossible bringing them in unless you bring bulk, like  
**[0:15:44-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:15:44):**  huge amounts of paid ridiculous amount of taxes, this, that, and half the time you probably  
**[0:15:50-0:15:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:15:50):**  wouldn't even get it.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:15:51):**  I mean, because I did try doing it all legally like that, you know, once in a while, but  
**[0:15:55-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:15:55):**  it didn't work.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:15:56):**  So I got into the whole heirloom seeds.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:16:01):**  That's when I got into the whole heirloom seeds and I was like, you know what, I need  
**[0:16:04-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:16:04):**  to start growing items that I can actually reproduce myself here.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:16:07):**  So that's when I started growing lettuces, I could make my own seed.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:16:10):**  That's when I started getting into arugula that I could do my own seed.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:16:13):**  That's when I guess I started choosing products that I could sell in my market.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:16:16):**  They were exotic, but at the same time were seeds that I can reproduce and therefore I  
**[0:16:21-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:16:21):**  didn't have to go through that trouble.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:16:22):**  I could just sneak in, you know, a couple hundred seeds into my pocket once and then  
**[0:16:27-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:16:27):**  start producing my own seeds and go from there on.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:16:30):**  So that came.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:16:32):**  But seed saving is no easy thing to get into.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:16:36):**  I mean it takes a whole, it's a whole system in itself, no?  
**[0:16:40-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:16:40):**  It was my way out to keep the business going if I wanted to sell these exotic things because  
**[0:16:46-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:16:46):**  no one was selling these exotic seeds.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:16:50):**  No one, you could barely find so many lettuce, try to find organic, romaine or lettuce seed  
**[0:16:56-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:16:56):**  was even difficult.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:16:57):**  Nowadays you can find it, but it's not the ones that, they're hybrids, you know, they're  
**[0:17:01-0:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:17:01):**  this, you know, Bayer, this, that, some of these seed companies have them, but it's not  
**[0:17:06-0:17:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:17:06):**  the one that you're going to want to reproduce seed from.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:17:08):**  And the seeds are ridiculously expensive.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:17:11):**  I mean, see when you buy something like that here, like a thousand seeds of romaine here  
**[0:17:15-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:17:15):**  in Guatemala are three, four times the price of a thousand seeds of romaine in the state.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:17:19):**  So I mean, start losing your numbers and then before you know it, you've got to sell lettuce  
**[0:17:24-0:17:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:17:24):**  so expensive that no one's going to buy it from you.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:17:28):**  So the idea was to produce seeds and yeah, getting into seeds was difficult.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:17:34):**  So I started my trial and error, you know, but I don't know if I always had a green thumb  
**[0:17:42-0:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:17:42):**  or just kind of came naturally to me or something, but you know, like it was, it never really  
**[0:17:46-0:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:17:46):**  became that hard for me.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:17:47):**  It was just, it was just, some seeds are more difficult than others and stuff, but it was  
**[0:17:52-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:17:52):**  just time, you know, it's just patience.  
**[0:17:55-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:17:55):**  Seeds are not fast, you know, they just take a while.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:17:59):**  And at this stage, were you doing most of the work yourself?  
**[0:18:03-0:18:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:18:03):**  Had you already taken on a bunch of people?  
**[0:18:05-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:18:05):**  No, I was doing most of the work myself for the first two years.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:18:12):**  I had one or two other people helping me out.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:18:14):**  And then as we started to do more seeds, as we started to grow more items, as we started  
**[0:18:21-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:18:21):**  to get more restaurants, well then it started to become more like managing people and less  
**[0:18:25-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:18:25):**  actual farm work.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:18:27):**  And that's when it started, that's when I'm telling you where you start, okay, now I got  
**[0:18:31-0:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:18:31):**  my yield, I'm self sustainable, I'm making money, this, that, then all of a sudden you're  
**[0:18:36-0:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:18:36):**  doing business, managing people and you're not, that's where the stress starts coming  
**[0:18:40-0:18:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:18:40):**  in.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:18:41):**  And people start enjoying your plot, you know, something that you would do just to grow for  
**[0:18:48-0:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:18:48):**  yourself.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:18:49):**  It would be nice to just retire and then do your garden.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:18:52):**  I mean, I think this is, you're touching on a really interesting point here, which is  
**[0:18:56-0:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:18:56):**  something that I think a lot of people, it's like a curve people go through in person.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:19:01):**  Permaculture where you maybe like start to farm, start an initiative with the intention  
**[0:19:07-0:19:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:19:07):**  of like whatever it is getting off the grid or being sustainable and all the rest of it.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:19:12):**  But then like you say, it brings all these responsibilities and all this management with  
**[0:19:16-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:19:16):**  it.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:19:17):**  And you know, eventually you might, you sort of try and go full circle with it, right?  
**[0:19:23-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:19:23):**  Like you eventually want to get back to having a little.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:19:27):**  And I don't know if it's rock bottom or hit the sky chart of the curve right now.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:19:32):**  So basically, and that doesn't mean that, you know, it's like everything in life is  
**[0:19:36-0:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:19:36):**  cycle.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:19:37):**  So right now I think I hit the top and now I'm really starting to come back down.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:19:40):**  I'm like, you know, trying to build my house in the farm.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:19:43):**  I want to go move out there.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:19:45):**  You know, I, I try to make this farm a lot smaller, you know, just way more sustainable  
**[0:19:50-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:19:50):**  way of running it on itself, not needing me, all that.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:19:54):**  So just, I want to, I want to get back to your future plans, right, for your land.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:19:58):**  But just before that, I think a lot of people listening to this will, because, you know,  
**[0:20:04-0:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:20:04):**  I'll say I said it in the introduction, but like Coble Farms is a fantastic example of  
**[0:20:10-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:20:10):**  like, like an urban agriculture project.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:20:13):**  You know, what size of an area have you got there?  
**[0:20:16-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:20:16):**  And sorry, I guess my question is like to somebody, cause I think urban agriculture  
**[0:20:22-0:20:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:20:22):**  and market gardening is becoming a real thing and it's, you know, people talk about having  
**[0:20:29-0:20:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:20:29):**  a lot of potential.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:20:31):**  What were like, what are like the keys to, to the, to the success of the model you're  
**[0:20:37-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:20:37):**  running?  
**[0:20:38-0:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:20:38):**  The keys to the success.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:20:40):**  I mean, I guess what if you're starting, my question is if you're starting, if somebody  
**[0:20:45-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:20:45):**  is looking at starting a sort of sustainable market farm or small scale agriculture project,  
**[0:20:53-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:20:53):**  what are the things that like you have to get right?  
**[0:20:56-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:20:56):**  And what are some tips on actually on getting those things right?  
**[0:21:00-0:21:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:21:00):**  Like you already talked about seeds.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:21:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:21:05):**  It depends on your, on the culture, the country where you're doing it at, I think.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:21:13):**  It was definitely never really a success here in Guatemala.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:21:17):**  I think we were not educated in there for her because I have a second salary from other  
**[0:21:25-0:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:21:25):**  businesses.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:21:26):**  I was able to really get to this goal.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:21:29):**  Even more for that, I'd probably be in the run for a long time ago.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:21:33):**  If you want to do things right, the correct way, not cheating anybody out, it's very hard  
**[0:21:39-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:21:39):**  work.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:21:40):**  It's a lot of time and people sell their food too cheap and don't understand it.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:21:44):**  Food not cheap, you go to any grocery store, 50% off, 70% off, this, that, and it's everything.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:21:52):**  It's like the grocery store pitch.  
**[0:21:55-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:21:55):**  Food has prostituted itself pretty much.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:22:00):**  Growing pure organic food with the hard work that you do and all that is really expensive.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:22:05):**  If the farmer is going to live properly, it's hard.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:22:11):**  Unless you have an educated community who's willing to spend the money and understand  
**[0:22:16-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:22:16):**  this, you're pretty much screwed.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:22:18):**  Guatemalans don't care about it.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:22:22):**  I was forced to sell products that were way more expensive.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:22:27):**  My competitors, my indirect competitors, let's call them because they're not exactly the  
**[0:22:31-0:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:22:31):**  same.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:22:32):**  Let's say someone else who sells a romaine lettuce, they're half the price and they're  
**[0:22:35-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:22:35):**  making large margins than me, like in profit.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:22:38):**  So it's like, sell for 20Q a pound, they sell for 10Q a pound.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:22:43):**  My expenses are 18Q, so I made 10%.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:22:47):**  Their expenses are 5, they're making 50%.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:22:50):**  So it's like one of those things where it's just difficult and I did it more for the love  
**[0:22:55-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:22:55):**  because for doing it.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:22:58):**  Now that education is coming into the Guatemal within I think the last four years, maybe  
**[0:23:03-0:23:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:23:03):**  it's starting to pick up.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:23:05):**  People are starting to become more knowledgeable with the internet and with more accessibility.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:23:10):**  Education, people are starting to understand healthy, sustainable, community, all this  
**[0:23:18-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:23:18):**  starting to pick up and it's becoming a trend.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:23:20):**  Therefore now they're starting to come to me and say, hey, even if it is expensive,  
**[0:23:25-0:23:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:23:25):**  they're willing to spend a bigger budget on what I'm doing than before.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:23:29):**  So it was hard getting to this point.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:23:30):**  Now I would say it's profitable.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:23:32):**  But before when I first was getting it, I was like, what am I doing here?  
**[0:23:37-0:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:23:37):**  It was just because that's what I like to do.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:23:40):**  And luckily I'm a guy who's pretty simple.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:23:43):**  Don't drive the newest car, I don't have a nice watch, I don't even carry a watch.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:23:48):**  I don't travel much.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:23:49):**  So I mean pretty much all the money I made was...  
**[0:23:55-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:23:55):**  Was invested into the firm.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:23:57):**  Yeah, and knowing that I had help from my family because they gave me a piece of property.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:24:02):**  So I mean, let's just assume, going back to like some kind of more technical stuff, right?  
**[0:24:09-0:24:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:24:09):**  Because I do feel like it's true what you say, you know, the barriers against doing  
**[0:24:15-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:24:15):**  organic agriculture are enormous, you know.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:24:19):**  Well, I think I started a while back when it wasn't, you know, it was a difficult time.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:24:26):**  I think starting nowadays there's a lot more opportunity.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:24:29):**  There's way more tourism, there's way more restaurants.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:24:31):**  There's way more of this, the internet has helped out, you know.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:24:35):**  So I think, I mean, if there's way more, I would say to anybody to start doing something  
**[0:24:39-0:24:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:24:39):**  more like this, but back in the day it was a bit more difficult.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:24:43):**  So going back to that, I mean, like the thing that always strikes me about Golba is like  
**[0:24:47-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:24:47):**  as a permaculture list and as a designer, I always think it's an extremely well designed  
**[0:24:54-0:24:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:24:54):**  farm, you know, like so, and like, you know, the fertility management.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:24:59):**  Just things I can tell someone, don't wait till something's perfect to do it, you know.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:25:05):**  Like some people wait till something's perfect and then they start doing something, you know,  
**[0:25:09-0:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:25:09):**  like just go with what you got and start doing it, you know, that's number one.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:25:14):**  Some people want to open up a restaurant and until they got everything perfect, you know,  
**[0:25:19-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:25:19):**  they'll open the doors to start business, you know.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:25:22):**  It's start out with what you got, you got recyclable tables and you got a little two  
**[0:25:26-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:25:26):**  burner stove and you really want to open up a restaurant with that and then with that  
**[0:25:30-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:25:30):**  see learn your curve, you know, you don't start with, you know, so you got a whole full  
**[0:25:37-0:25:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:25:37):**  stainless steel kitchen and this and you invested, you know, a hundred thousand dollars in your  
**[0:25:41-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:25:41):**  restaurant and then you're going to open up and then no one shows up.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:25:43):**  You're like, oh my God, what happened?  
**[0:25:45-0:25:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:25:45):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:25:46):**  So start with what you got and that comes down to this farming also.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:25:49):**  Don't start to, oh, I need to have arugula and I need to have carrots and I need to have  
**[0:25:54-0:25:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:25:54):**  basil and I need to get at least 10 products before I can even go to a restaurant and offer  
**[0:25:58-0:26:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:25:58):**  or to a farmer's market or I need to have like a good clean list of things that I can  
**[0:26:04-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:26:04):**  sell.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:26:05):**  So just go for what you have and go for it.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:26:10):**  Yeah, go for it and start with what you got and then, you know, you'll slowly, if it's  
**[0:26:15-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:26:15):**  for you, then you'll slowly get more and more and more.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:26:18):**  If it's not for you, you'll learn and they'll tell you.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:26:20):**  Right.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:26:21):**  That's number one.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:26:22):**  Just start with what you got.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:26:23):**  Don't go like, you know, oh, I need two acres of land or I need 50 acres of land.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:26:28):**  Oh, I can't do anything unless I got all that.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:26:30):**  You have a quarter acre of land, you know, like start with that, you know, if you got  
**[0:26:33-0:26:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:26:33):**  less than that, even that, just start with whatever you got.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:26:36):**  You know, just if you got a little backyard and then you think you can grow, you know,  
**[0:26:40-0:26:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:26:40):**  a lot of spearmint and you have a next door neighbor who has a bar and sells mojitos,  
**[0:26:46-0:26:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:26:46):**  you know, and then that's what you really want to do.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:26:48):**  Start growing spearmint in the backyard.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:26:51):**  That's number one, say just start with something.  
**[0:26:55-0:27:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:26:55):**  So then like going, say like talking technically speaking, you know, it looks like you did  
**[0:27:00-0:27:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:27:00):**  a great job in like building fertility in any of the pieces of land that you've managed.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:27:05):**  Like what are some tips that you give to people who just want to like, yeah, get fertility  
**[0:27:09-0:27:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:27:09):**  going in a piece of ground quickly and make it productive?  
**[0:27:13-0:27:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:27:13):**  Well, if you have the money and you can invest and do that, that's probably the easiest.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:27:18):**  You just buy a lot of stuff and not many people have that, so.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:27:23):**  But you want to create fertility, I would say start like with a no till area, you know,  
**[0:27:35-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:27:35):**  like start in a no till something.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:27:38):**  Maybe, you know, grow some type of grass or legume that goes crazy, creates lots of bio  
**[0:27:48-0:27:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:27:48):**  mass, chop it, drop it and then plant off of that, you know.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:27:53):**  Maybe you do a second one if you have time and energy, you do a second one.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:27:59):**  Then start planting or maybe you start, you know, 80% of your field, you do it like that  
**[0:28:07-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:28:07):**  and 20% you actually buy some fertilizer.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:28:10):**  So basically, maybe you grab a piece of the property, you know, and you start working  
**[0:28:16-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:28:16):**  the fertility on a slow basis and then you grab a little area of the farm and you actually  
**[0:28:23-0:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:28:23):**  purchase some good fertile soil and start working with that.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:28:26):**  So by the time that starts, you know, you start getting something out of that 20% or  
**[0:28:32-0:28:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:28:32):**  10% of your land, then your other major parts of the land are starting to get more fertile.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:28:41):**  Start with crops that are very easy for your area, you know, things that don't need much  
**[0:28:45-0:28:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:28:45):**  fertility, you know.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:28:46):**  It's another big one, you know, just if you really want to grow carrots but, you know,  
**[0:28:52-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:28:52):**  that your area is not for carrots, then don't do carrots, you know.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:28:57):**  Like if it's, if your area is known for, you know, beans, then do beans, you know, if your  
**[0:29:02-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:29:02):**  area is known for and so that's one of them.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:29:06):**  And then the other thing is if you can start from the very get-go, start doing some like  
**[0:29:11-0:29:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:29:11):**  land management which is what I call it, just get some chickens, you know, start doing that  
**[0:29:17-0:29:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:29:17):**  and then let your weeds grow and then just feed your chickens weed, they'll turn your  
**[0:29:22-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:29:22):**  fertile soil into, you know, that soil into some really nice stuff and then move on to  
**[0:29:28-0:29:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:29:28):**  another area and have them start throwing weeds there and by then you can start planting  
**[0:29:31-0:29:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:29:31):**  on the area where the chickens were.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:29:35):**  That's a fast way of getting some good nutrients into the ground, you know, you can just do  
**[0:29:40-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:29:40):**  one month, you know, you put your chickens in one area for about a month, six weeks,  
**[0:29:45-0:29:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:29:45):**  feed them weeds, you move them, you let them, you get them out of there, you know, you start  
**[0:29:50-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:29:50):**  tilling the soil a bit and then you got already an area to start planting, guaranteed that  
**[0:29:55-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:29:55):**  most stuff is going to work there.  
**[0:29:57-0:29:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:29:57):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:29:58):**  And I mean you've always, any pieces of land that I go to of yours, there's never animals  
**[0:30:05-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:30:05):**  far away, there's always ducks and pigs and sheep and chickens and piles of manure, like  
**[0:30:15-0:30:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:30:15):**  always in Pilares and in Antigua, you obviously see lots of animals and quite a diversity  
**[0:30:21-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:30:21):**  of animals, you know.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:30:23):**  Yeah, we create 100% of our fertilizer, we don't outsource any fertilizer, you know,  
**[0:30:29-0:30:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:30:29):**  that's our big thing.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:30:30):**  One thing we do outsource is like carbon, carbon stuff, you know, like sawdust or hay  
**[0:30:38-0:30:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:30:38):**  and that's something, you know, when you have animals, I'm not going to tell you it's hay  
**[0:30:43-0:30:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:30:43):**  or it's sawdust, I mean maybe in your area it's dry leaves of some type of forest nearby  
**[0:30:47-0:30:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:30:47):**  or you know, it's like you got to find what you have nearby that you can work with and  
**[0:30:52-0:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:30:52):**  you know, that's the perfect combination, carbon to nitrogen from the poop of the animals  
**[0:30:58-0:31:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:30:58):**  and then you create amazing fertilizer and unless you got your big huge land and from  
**[0:31:04-0:31:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:31:04):**  there you can get your own carbon source.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:31:06):**  I feel like that's always the thing that people underestimate maybe is where to get a good  
**[0:31:11-0:31:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:31:11):**  source of carbon, I mean there always is something but it's never, it's tough to get a good reliable  
**[0:31:18-0:31:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:31:18):**  one here as well.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:31:19):**  Yeah, I mean it could be, you know, it could be milpa, it could be the sticks of milpa,  
**[0:31:29-0:31:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:31:29):**  just throw a whole bunch of them in, who knows what, I mean it could be, there's a lot, I  
**[0:31:34-0:31:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:31:34):**  mean some are better than others but you got to work with what you got unless you want  
**[0:31:37-0:31:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:31:37):**  to, you know, outsource farther away but sometimes the farther you go the harder it becomes,  
**[0:31:42-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:31:42):**  you know.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:31:43):**  Right, yeah.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:31:44):**  And then the idea is eventually, you know, if you get enough land and stuff to start  
**[0:31:47-0:31:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:31:47):**  producing it yourself, I mean that becomes hard.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:31:52):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:31:54-0:32:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:31:54):**  Alright so, you know, to hear you talk about it, it sounds like you had like quite a business  
**[0:32:03-0:32:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:32:03):**  focused practical mindset about getting into this stuff but I know from being with you  
**[0:32:09-0:32:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:32:09):**  on your farm and on your new piece of land that you are very passionate about how the  
**[0:32:18-0:32:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:32:18):**  impact your farms have and on kind of all kinds, like you're very passionate about biodiversity  
**[0:32:24-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:32:24):**  in your areas and about kind of regeneration in general I always feel, so can you maybe  
**[0:32:30-0:32:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:32:30):**  talk about like how you're, did getting into this style of agriculture, did it change your  
**[0:32:35-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:32:35):**  perspective or was it something that was always there?  
**[0:32:38-0:32:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:32:38):**  So, I come from, I went to a boarding school in Colorado back in the day, that's really  
**[0:32:45-0:32:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:32:45):**  where I got into it.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:32:47):**  I left Guatemala when I was 14 and I was there till I was 18 and this boarding school was  
**[0:32:56-0:33:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:32:56):**  very like hands-on boarding school.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:33:00):**  We had our own carpentry, everything was made there, we had our electrician crews so we  
**[0:33:05-0:33:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:33:05):**  had vehicles, we had a ranch so we had to take care of the animals, we had to do chipping  
**[0:33:12-0:33:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:33:12):**  our eyes, we had to and one of them we had to cook everything in the cafeteria, we had  
**[0:33:16-0:33:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:33:16):**  people there, we had library crew and we had one of them was gardening, you know, and within  
**[0:33:21-0:33:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:33:21):**  the gardening was all the day students and mothers from the gardening program and yeah,  
**[0:33:27-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:33:27):**  I'd say 20% of everything we had in school was from our garden, you know, like I mean  
**[0:33:33-0:33:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:33:33):**  there was a lot of stuff that came from our garden and it's only gotten bigger, like nowadays  
**[0:33:38-0:33:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:33:38):**  I keep up through Facebook with, I don't really have Facebook, once in a while I do have Facebook,  
**[0:33:43-0:33:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:33:43):**  that's kind of, I don't have it on my phone, I don't have it, it's just once in a while  
**[0:33:49-0:33:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:33:49):**  when I log in my computer and it's so difficult, you notice it but I follow my boarding school  
**[0:33:57-0:34:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:33:57):**  and I see their gardening program has grown a lot and so that was my first introduction  
**[0:34:03-0:34:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:34:03):**  to really like, you know, day student mothers who always had a garden plot, so they were  
**[0:34:09-0:34:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:34:09):**  already doing preserves, growing stuff and there was a different season, so there was  
**[0:34:13-0:34:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:34:13):**  the winter so we had to prepare things and the winter for when spring came and then spring  
**[0:34:18-0:34:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:34:18):**  for when summer and for the fall and then get ready again for winter, so it was kind  
**[0:34:22-0:34:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:34:22):**  of cool then I started learning kind of like what I teach is the difference between an  
**[0:34:34-0:34:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:34:34):**  organic product versus organic agriculture, which for me, organic agriculture is a lot  
**[0:34:40-0:34:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:34:40):**  more than just a product, you know, you can have a big company like Chiquita banana sell  
**[0:34:45-0:34:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:34:45):**  organic bananas nowadays but that doesn't mean it follows organic agriculture practices,  
**[0:34:51-0:34:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:34:51):**  it just follows organic product practices, it just puts organic fertilizer and sprays  
**[0:34:59-0:35:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:34:59):**  organic leafy, all that type of stuff but that doesn't mean it's installing all these  
**[0:35:04-0:35:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:35:04):**  other practices, you know, go ahead and handle all permaculture and you know, those are sustainability,  
**[0:35:11-0:35:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:35:11):**  you know, which I believe in a lot and I try to be as sustainable as possible, my goal  
**[0:35:18-0:35:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:35:18):**  is to be 100% sustainable but I don't think I'm nowhere near that but that's the goal.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:35:24):**  Biodiversity, you know, that's the other one, you know, the more biodiversity the better,  
**[0:35:30-0:35:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:35:30):**  you know, how low impact to the environment can you be, you know, like just because you're  
**[0:35:35-0:35:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:35:35):**  organic that doesn't mean that you're not being a high impact to the environment.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:35:38):**  Well I mean, I might even say, the one of the things I definitely notice about co-op  
**[0:35:42-0:35:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:35:42):**  of farms and about other pieces of land that I've seen for years is it's not just that,  
**[0:35:48-0:35:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:35:48):**  it's very hard, you're not going to have no impact on the environment but you're, a lot  
**[0:35:52-0:35:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:35:52):**  of the farming you seem to do actually seems to have a positive impact on the environment,  
**[0:35:57-0:35:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:35:57):**  you know, it's like…  
**[0:35:58-0:36:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:35:58):**  I try to do it, the least amount and if possible, positive impact, so that's what we try to  
**[0:36:05-0:36:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:36:05):**  do and then with the, you know, impact to the environment like I said, I mean, you can  
**[0:36:10-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:36:10):**  have an organic product, organic coffee let's say, you know, it's very popular, okay, we  
**[0:36:15-0:36:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:36:15):**  got organic coffee but it could be that they cut a whole mountain full of forest, you know,  
**[0:36:19-0:36:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:36:19):**  that was very diverse, was more sustainable, you know, and they just wiped down the forest  
**[0:36:25-0:36:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:36:25):**  and sure enough they plant coffee but it's organic because now they're fertilizing it  
**[0:36:29-0:36:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:36:29):**  with organic, that's not a low impact.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:36:32):**  And they can take all the fertility that the forest left there and use it.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:36:36):**  So, that's organic coffee for you but, you know, it's not sustainable, it's not low impact,  
**[0:36:42-0:36:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:36:42):**  it's not biodiverse, you know, so you're losing all those already with the common hand with,  
**[0:36:46-0:36:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:36:46):**  you know, organic agriculture which there's many methods, one of them being permaculture,  
**[0:36:53-0:36:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:36:53):**  you know, and within permaculture there's many other methods, you know, biointensive,  
**[0:36:57-0:37:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:36:57):**  you know, bio-dynamic, you know, no tilling, food forest.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:37:02):**  Yeah, could you talk maybe in terms of like which of those techniques that you mentioned  
**[0:37:07-0:37:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:37:07):**  say has influenced your thinking the most or has it been a mix of all of them?  
**[0:37:13-0:37:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:37:13):**  It's been a mix, it's been a mix, I mean, I have fun, I have more fun with some and  
**[0:37:18-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:37:18):**  I use others more for business, so biointensive for me is a very business oriented but it's  
**[0:37:25-0:37:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:37:25):**  a profit with business area, you know, there's different terms to each one, you know, one  
**[0:37:32-0:37:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:37:32):**  kind of their self seeding in a biointensive, you need to have the stuff you're planting  
**[0:37:36-0:37:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:37:36):**  is for you're making your own seed, you know, you need large amounts of seed to be doing  
**[0:37:40-0:37:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:37:40):**  biointensive but you got to be on top of your seeds.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:37:44):**  Biointensive just as like when we talk about biointensive you're essentially saying why?  
**[0:37:50-0:37:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:37:50):**  How much money, that's at the end of the game is how much money can you get off a square  
**[0:37:53-0:38:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:37:53):**  foot per year, you know, that's business oriented, you know, how much produce, how much stuff,  
**[0:38:00-0:38:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:38:00):**  how much money wise can you get off of one square foot by doing it always in a sustainable  
**[0:38:06-0:38:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:38:06):**  way in organic as possible, that's for me biointensive.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:38:13):**  And it really implies kind of really well composted fertilizers, liquid fertilizers,  
**[0:38:20-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:38:20):**  saving your own seed, double digging your own beds.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:38:23):**  Yeah, you don't, you don't rest the land so you need a lot of backup fertilizer, you need  
**[0:38:28-0:38:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:38:28):**  a lot of biomass to keep feeding and feeding and feeding that land so it doesn't get sick,  
**[0:38:34-0:38:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:38:34):**  you know, you need to incorporate so much stuff into it.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:38:37):**  So it's a lot of work because you got to be doing your, with biointensive comes many other  
**[0:38:43-0:38:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:38:43):**  areas that don't see where it's growing, you need a lot of fertilizer, you need a lot of  
**[0:38:46-0:38:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:38:46):**  seeds, you need a lot of labor, you know, but with that you produce a lot of product  
**[0:38:51-0:38:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:38:51):**  and if you have where to sell it, well there you go with a small plot you can produce quite  
**[0:38:55-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:38:55):**  a bit.  
**[0:38:56-0:39:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:38:56):**  And you can be very consistent, you know, that's the other big word, consistency, you  
**[0:39:02-0:39:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:39:02):**  know, with biointensive you can be very consistent with a food forest, with no tilling, with  
**[0:39:06-0:39:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:39:06):**  other things, you can do a lot but with a lot less, the thing is you can, doesn't mean  
**[0:39:11-0:39:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:39:11):**  you can't make money but there's a lot less expenses to it, you don't produce as much  
**[0:39:15-0:39:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:39:15):**  but there's a lot less expenses so your margin of winnings could be just as good if you do  
**[0:39:20-0:39:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:39:20):**  it correctly, which a lot of people like, you know, because it's chiller, just mellower  
**[0:39:25-0:39:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:39:25):**  and all that and you can still produce enough to sell and make money but your expenses are  
**[0:39:29-0:39:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:39:29):**  so much lower and because labor is much lower, your input into it is a lot lower, therefore  
**[0:39:35-0:39:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:39:35):**  your margin could be a lot bigger with what you sell but you don't sell anywhere near  
**[0:39:40-0:39:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:39:40):**  as much per square foot a year than you what you would do with a biointensive program.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:39:44):**  So with biointensive you need a, unless you're outsourcing everything but then it's, you're  
**[0:39:49-0:39:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:39:49):**  not following the sustainable part, you can outsource your seeds, you can outsource your,  
**[0:39:53-0:40:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:39:53):**  you know, labor, you can outsource your manure and your fertilizing and all that and therefore  
**[0:40:00-0:40:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:40:00):**  but then it ends up actually being more expensive.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:40:04):**  But then like you say, like you say, you've got like a nice mix to your farms because  
**[0:40:08-0:40:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:40:08):**  you've got that biointensive thing right in the middle of co-op farms, your big Bokashi  
**[0:40:15-0:40:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:40:15):**  production area and then really all around it is like your sort of dream permaculture  
**[0:40:23-0:40:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:40:23):**  forest gardens around the whole thing with like...  
**[0:40:25-0:40:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:40:25):**  More like those little food forests and that and then, you know, it's a small area so we're  
**[0:40:31-0:40:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:40:31):**  not managing a few other styles, you know, in the other farms we manage no tilling, land  
**[0:40:37-0:40:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:40:37):**  management, you know, food forests again, biointensive and, you know, you get into some  
**[0:40:43-0:40:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:40:43):**  other, you know, practices, you know, that you can manage so...  
**[0:40:48-0:40:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:40:48):**  Okay so I wanna, I wanna, getting, getting, staying on this stuff right, like I know you  
**[0:40:53-0:40:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:40:53):**  sort of mentioned some of the disadvantages to working in Guate right, like there's not  
**[0:40:57-0:41:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:40:57):**  really this culture of liking organic food, there's heavy use of sort of conventional  
**[0:41:03-0:41:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:41:03):**  agricultural techniques but like then at the same time you can't help but see all this  
**[0:41:09-0:41:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:41:09):**  potential in this incredible ecosystem with all this biodiversity, like do you see, do  
**[0:41:19-0:41:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:41:19):**  you see any chance of the type of agriculture you're doing really catching on here and really  
**[0:41:25-0:41:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:41:25):**  being taken and implemented on a large scale?  
**[0:41:30-0:41:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:41:30):**  Yeah, I mean it's, it's, it's, it's the systems I manage are meant to be reproduced on a large  
**[0:41:37-0:41:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:41:37):**  scale and that's what I'm starting to do with Paramas, I mean, it's, it's, it's the larger  
**[0:41:42-0:41:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:41:42):**  you get the more sustainable it becomes I feel like, you know, it's like, it's, you  
**[0:41:47-0:41:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:41:47):**  know, you've got more access to more fertilizer, to more wood chips, to way more access of,  
**[0:41:52-0:41:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:41:52):**  of land for your land, animals can groom and produce way more that and all that, really  
**[0:41:58-0:42:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:41:58):**  what it comes down to is, you know, you're definitely gonna need a little bit more, more  
**[0:42:01-0:42:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:42:01):**  labor but with that comes more money therefore you can, you know, the problem is once you  
**[0:42:06-0:42:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:42:06):**  start getting bigger is finding markets for this stuff because, you know, you're gonna  
**[0:42:11-0:42:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:42:11):**  become a lot, as long as you've got a market where to sell it you're becoming way more  
**[0:42:15-0:42:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:42:15):**  profitable in terms of like dollars, dollars spent, dollars sold, you know, the, you know,  
**[0:42:21-0:42:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:42:21):**  you're then in a smaller area because you've got so much more to work with but you need  
**[0:42:25-0:42:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:42:25):**  to, as you get, there's a balance to where you, you can sell it because if you start  
**[0:42:29-0:42:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:42:29):**  producing way more than you can sell and get rid of then all of a sudden you're, you know,  
**[0:42:34-0:42:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:42:34):**  you're end up with all this stuff and then that starts getting higher and you're...  
**[0:42:39-0:42:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:42:39):**  So what is, why don't you tell me a little bit, what's your vision for this place in  
**[0:42:44-0:42:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:42:44):**  Paramos, this, this hundred acre place that you've bought in, in the Highlands?  
**[0:42:49-0:42:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:42:49):**  Well, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's actually a lot more, we just bought more land so now  
**[0:42:55-0:43:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:42:55):**  we have about 150 acres but basically, you know, that's where we start integrating a  
**[0:43:02-0:43:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:43:02):**  lot more than just farming, you know, you got to integrate community and so that's something  
**[0:43:07-0:43:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:43:07):**  I didn't finish so I was saying sustainability comes with organic agriculture I think, you  
**[0:43:12-0:43:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:43:12):**  know, biodiversity, low impact but within, after that there's more, more things and there's  
**[0:43:19-0:43:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:43:19):**  community oriented, you know, how do you involve your community to educate?  
**[0:43:23-0:43:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:43:23):**  So that within community then comes education and then with education and then far but not  
**[0:43:28-0:43:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:43:28):**  least is organic practices meaning organic fertilizing, organic spraying if you're going  
**[0:43:34-0:43:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:43:34):**  to do any of that, you know, and how with sustainability comes how can you produce your  
**[0:43:40-0:43:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:43:40):**  organic fertilizer and your organic sprays, you know, that's, that's the more you can  
**[0:43:45-0:43:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:43:45):**  produce your, all your own stuff, the more sustainable you are, the more control you  
**[0:43:48-0:43:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:43:48):**  have over everything.  
**[0:43:51-0:44:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:43:51):**  But now I'm at the step where I'm trying to, so I've done a good successful job at, I've  
**[0:44:00-0:44:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:44:00):**  done a good successful job at sustainability, I feel like I'm pretty sustainable in many  
**[0:44:04-0:44:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:44:04):**  areas of the field, I've done the goods at biodiversity, I've done a good at trying to  
**[0:44:09-0:44:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:44:09):**  be low impact, like you said, we're trying to create a high, even a better impact instead  
**[0:44:14-0:44:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:44:14):**  of low impact, you know, we're reforesting areas, you know, we're bringing back soil  
**[0:44:20-0:44:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:44:20):**  richness to the soil, we're bringing it back in biodiversity, you know, we're bringing  
**[0:44:24-0:44:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:44:24):**  all these things back that probably didn't exist, you know, or were lacking of or very  
**[0:44:29-0:44:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:44:29):**  minimum and so we're doing that.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:44:34):**  And then we've done a good job now at the, not at Paramas yet but in Cabo Farms, the  
**[0:44:41-0:44:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:44:41):**  most recent one has been community, we've opened up a farm, we got all these activities,  
**[0:44:45-0:44:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:44:45):**  we have farmers market, we have all that stuff, you know, our next step is trying to move  
**[0:44:49-0:44:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:44:49):**  into education, you know, how to create an income from educating people through teaching  
**[0:44:56-0:45:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:44:56):**  them farming, cooking, you know, work crews, it could be anything from electricity to carpentry  
**[0:45:04-0:45:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:45:04):**  to ceramics to, I mean, just and to workshops like yoga and diets and who knows what you  
**[0:45:10-0:45:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:45:10):**  can come up with, I mean, there's hundreds of things but through educating and that's  
**[0:45:14-0:45:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:45:14):**  what we're starting to get into and I think we've, we're just starting to get into that  
**[0:45:19-0:45:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:45:19):**  into, so I'm just starting to get into that in the Cabo Farms in Antigua and we're still  
**[0:45:26-0:45:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:45:26):**  pretty far away from all that in Cabo Farms in Paramas but that's going to be pretty much  
**[0:45:31-0:45:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:45:31):**  what we're going to do in the farm in Paramas but taking it up to the next level, you know,  
**[0:45:35-0:45:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:45:35):**  hopefully where we have so much land to play with that where, you know, hopefully we'll  
**[0:45:40-0:45:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:45:40):**  have retreats, you know, tours, you know, all sorts of courses, you know, we can, it'd  
**[0:45:48-0:45:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:45:48):**  be nice to come up with something like a little tiny like school and, you know, even places  
**[0:45:55-0:45:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:45:55):**  where you can get credits from universities to come there and take a course and get credits  
**[0:45:59-0:46:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:45:59):**  and head on out, you know, so I mean that's.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:46:02):**  Yeah and you know you've got the, you know, you've got the support of Abundant Edge and  
**[0:46:07-0:46:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:46:07):**  Athlete Land Organics and all these plans for education and we'll put up through the  
**[0:46:16-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:46:16):**  Abundant Edge website, we'll for sure put up any courses that are going to be coming  
**[0:46:21-0:46:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:46:21):**  up in the next sort of year or so because I really think you've got a fantastic teaching  
**[0:46:26-0:46:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:46:26):**  space there, you know, and a lot of really useful stuff to learn.  
**[0:46:32-0:46:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:46:32):**  It's not just hogging it up well for yourself, there's only so much you can do by yourself  
**[0:46:36-0:46:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:46:36):**  so the idea is that there's where comes community and that's why, you know, get teachers who  
**[0:46:42-0:46:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:46:42):**  go, you know, yoga retreats, okay, we find the yoga retreat guide, you know, you want  
**[0:46:46-0:46:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:46:46):**  to do a fermentation course, we get fermentation people, you want to do a construction course,  
**[0:46:51-0:46:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:46:51):**  we get construction guides, you know, we want to do a permaculture course, we bring the  
**[0:46:55-0:47:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:46:55):**  permaculture guides, you know, you want to do a ranch crew, deal with animals, do that,  
**[0:47:00-0:47:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:47:00):**  you want to get a butcher and then I found a really cool butcher who's like a Jewish  
**[0:47:04-0:47:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:47:04):**  kosher butcher from the States, butchers all sorts of stuff.  
**[0:47:09-0:47:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:47:09):**  He's a professional.  
**[0:47:10-0:47:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:47:10):**  Hell yeah.  
**[0:47:11-0:47:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:47:11):**  He actually went to university to be a butcher.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:47:15):**  That's the kind of guy you want to be learning from.  
**[0:47:17-0:47:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:47:17):**  Yeah, so I mean like stuff like that, you know, so I mean I can't do none of that but  
**[0:47:22-0:47:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:47:22):**  that, you know, the facility we got to place itself to bring all these people, share the  
**[0:47:28-0:47:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:47:28):**  community, give the education and then, you know, we are a business so try to make some  
**[0:47:33-0:47:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:47:33):**  income out of all this so we can support local community as well, giving jobs, you know,  
**[0:47:41-0:47:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:47:41):**  and all sorts of stuff.  
**[0:47:44-0:47:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:47:44):**  It's exciting, man.  
**[0:47:45-0:47:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:47:45):**  It's exciting.  
**[0:47:46-0:47:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:47:46):**  I think a lot of our listeners are going to really want to sign up for some of these courses  
**[0:47:50-0:47:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:47:50):**  so we'll talk more about that after the interview.  
**[0:47:54-0:47:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:47:54):**  Yeah, yeah, for sure, for sure.  
**[0:47:58-0:48:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:47:58):**  But no, man, that's super exciting and your plan is to go up and live there too, right?  
**[0:48:06-0:48:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:48:06):**  Yeah, I needed to do something, I needed to get out of it as soon as possible so I went,  
**[0:48:12-0:48:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:48:12):**  you know, I did it super simple with what I had and just went with that, you know, and  
**[0:48:17-0:48:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:48:17):**  so I couldn't wait to start doing that Go Bricks and this and that and all sort of,  
**[0:48:22-0:48:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:48:22):**  you know, I just went off with wood, started going as much as possible as I could and not  
**[0:48:29-0:48:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:48:29):**  even wood from the farm, just buying wood, you know, I had a little bit of money so right  
**[0:48:33-0:48:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:48:33):**  now I just didn't have time for drying the wood.  
**[0:48:36-0:48:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:48:36):**  I just needed to get out of the other farm because I live behind the kitchen of a restaurant  
**[0:48:39-0:48:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:48:39):**  so it was driving me freaking crazy and the place is big enough that, you know, all these  
**[0:48:44-0:48:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:48:44):**  other houses from here on on which once I'm there, I'm going to just, I just needed to  
**[0:48:49-0:48:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:48:49):**  be at that farm now so once I'm there, everything else can come so much smoother and more sustainable  
**[0:48:54-0:48:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:48:54):**  and although this is going to have an eco toilet and we're going to have hot water through  
**[0:48:57-0:49:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:48:57):**  compost and solar and, you know, we're going to have, it's going to be, it's going to be  
**[0:49:03-0:49:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:49:03):**  pretty fun but we're going to definitely take the other houses way to the next level with  
**[0:49:10-0:49:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:49:10):**  people who know what they're doing because I don't, I sure don't when it comes to construction  
**[0:49:14-0:49:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:49:14):**  and that's where we've been trying to bring in Oliver here and, you know, you guys and  
**[0:49:17-0:49:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:49:17):**  see what we can do.  
**[0:49:19-0:49:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:49:19):**  There's so much to play with.  
**[0:49:20-0:49:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:49:20):**  I just couldn't wait, you know, I couldn't wait to get going so that's why I started  
**[0:49:26-0:49:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:49:26):**  with my house.  
**[0:49:28-0:49:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:49:28):**  Small, you know, but it'll be cozy and then once I'm there, you know, I'll probably be  
**[0:49:34-0:49:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:49:34):**  there three quarters of the time and a quarter of the time in Antigua and once I'm there,  
**[0:49:40-0:49:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:49:40):**  you know, I'll be able to have more clear minded and start thinking of future projects  
**[0:49:45-0:49:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:49:45):**  and I won't be in a hurry because everything else can come a little bit smoother with like  
**[0:49:48-0:49:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:49:48):**  naturally this one was kind of forced into it just which is not the way I like to do  
**[0:49:54-0:49:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:49:54):**  things but I really needed to personally get out of the other place.  
**[0:49:59-0:50:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:49:59):**  So yeah, I'm excited.  
**[0:50:04-0:50:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:50:04):**  It's super exciting man and I can't wait to design some projects and some courses with  
**[0:50:10-0:50:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:50:10):**  you.  
**[0:50:11-0:50:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:50:11):**  I'm super super excited as well.  
**[0:50:15-0:50:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:50:15):**  So listen Alex, that's all I wanted to get through.  
**[0:50:19-0:50:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:50:19):**  It's been great talking to you and thanks so much for taking the time.  
**[0:50:23-0:50:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:50:23):**  I think there's a lot of really interesting stuff in there for people, I hope.  
**[0:50:28-0:50:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:50:28):**  Well, I mean, we can always have a part two later on.  
**[0:50:32-0:50:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:50:32):**  I mean, I think we can have a part three and a four especially as this land in Paramos  
**[0:50:40-0:50:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:50:40):**  starts to develop because you're really going to be seeing as you say two totally different  
**[0:50:47-0:50:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:50:47):**  styles of agriculture there.  
**[0:50:49-0:50:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:50:49):**  Yeah, like I mean actually the interesting thing about well digging, you know, well digging  
**[0:50:53-0:50:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:50:53):**  is like an art.  
**[0:50:54-0:50:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:50:54):**  Well digging is an art.  
**[0:50:57-0:51:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:50:57):**  I mean Guatemala for people who are listening from other countries is such a fascinating  
**[0:51:01-0:51:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:51:01):**  place to study agriculture anyway because even in the 40 minutes that separates your  
**[0:51:06-0:51:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:51:06):**  land in Antigua and in Paramos those are two totally different, totally different climates.  
**[0:51:13-0:51:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:51:13):**  Yeah, I got a list of new plants coming around, you know, exciting new plants.  
**[0:51:20-0:51:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:51:20):**  I got all sorts of crazy stuff I brought from Europe and all that which I'm going to start,  
**[0:51:23-0:51:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:51:23):**  I was finally starting to reproduce from seed from different types of apples to different  
**[0:51:27-0:51:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:51:27):**  types of apricots and plums to mulberries.  
**[0:51:31-0:51:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:51:31):**  I'm getting all these like really crazy berries like blackcurrant, redcurrants, you know,  
**[0:51:36-0:51:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:51:36):**  I'm starting to get these, all these crazy stuff that we're getting, you know, starting  
**[0:51:44-0:51:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:51:44):**  to reproduce.  
**[0:51:45-0:51:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:51:45):**  So for that area which is areas for colder weather, higher temperature, you know, so  
**[0:51:49-0:51:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:51:49):**  yeah, higher altitude.  
**[0:51:51-0:51:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:51:51):**  Yeah, it's exciting man.  
**[0:51:55-0:51:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:51:55):**  Have you got any nice varieties of potatoes?  
**[0:51:58-0:52:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:51:58):**  Any of the South American?  
**[0:52:00-0:52:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:52:00):**  Have you had a chance to bring in any of them?  
**[0:52:02-0:52:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:52:02):**  I have a lot of varieties of yams and potatoes.  
**[0:52:08-0:52:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:52:08):**  I have gotten into the potatoes.  
**[0:52:09-0:52:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:52:09):**  Every time I seem to want to buy potatoes, it seems like a lot of season or something,  
**[0:52:14-0:52:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:52:14):**  you know, and so I haven't been able to find potatoes.  
**[0:52:18-0:52:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:52:18):**  I did get some good garlic varieties but I will start getting into the potatoes.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:52:26):**  I did get into some crazy roots from Peru, the Muaka and Joaca and so I'm not even  
**[0:52:33-0:52:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:52:33):**  pronouncing it properly but they're like kind of like potatoes but they're a lot smaller  
**[0:52:39-0:52:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:52:39):**  but they got all this flavor in them, you know, so it's kind of weird stuff.  
**[0:52:42-0:52:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:52:42):**  You see the thing is I'm asking you this because I'm Irish, you know, and it's like  
**[0:52:48-0:52:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:52:48):**  the worst thing about living in Guatemala is I can't get good potatoes.  
**[0:52:50-0:52:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:52:50):**  I can't get good potatoes and I can't get good strawberries and I feel like where you  
**[0:52:54-0:52:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:52:54):**  are there you could have messed a lot with that.  
**[0:52:56-0:52:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:52:56):**  That's another thing.  
**[0:52:57-0:53:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:52:57):**  I just started some strawberries from seed.  
**[0:53:00-0:53:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:53:00):**  They come from Sweden and Sweden have really good strawberries and so I got about 20 plants  
**[0:53:08-0:53:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:53:08):**  that are about an inch tall right now that came from seed when I went to Sweden.  
**[0:53:13-0:53:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:53:13):**  So that's kind of nice and once we get those I'll start reproducing and sending you guys  
**[0:53:17-0:53:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:53:17):**  some babies.  
**[0:53:19-0:53:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:53:19):**  I'd like that.  
**[0:53:20-0:53:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:53:20):**  I feel like they're not going to like it quite as much strawberries here in Atitlan Organics  
**[0:53:25-0:53:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:53:25):**  as they will up their higher in Paramas with you but I think we could do it.  
**[0:53:30-0:53:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:53:30):**  They like cool days, you know, they like a lot of sun but it needs to be kind of cool,  
**[0:53:34-0:53:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:53:34):**  you know.  
**[0:53:35-0:53:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:53:35):**  Yeah, they kill it where I'm from in Ireland, you know.  
**[0:53:38-0:53:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:53:38):**  Well, you get those full days that are sunny and bright but it's...  
**[0:53:42-0:53:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:53:42):**  And long, long days too, you know, I feel like that's a big thing.  
**[0:53:47-0:53:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:53:47):**  That's something we don't get in Paramas either.  
**[0:53:52-0:53:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:53:52):**  I mean it's one of the few things in the whole world that grows well in Ireland and doesn't  
**[0:53:58-0:54:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:53:58):**  grow well in Guatemala because just about everything grows here somewhere.  
**[0:54:02-0:54:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:54:02):**  That's the kind of amazing thing about it, right?  
**[0:54:05-0:54:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:54:05):**  Because of the long days that really kill us, you know.  
**[0:54:08-0:54:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:54:08):**  And that's probably with seeds too I think.  
**[0:54:10-0:54:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:54:10):**  Some plants are very hard to grow in the seed because there's no long enough summers.  
**[0:54:15-0:54:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:54:15):**  Yeah things like chard and beets and all those kinds of things they don't seem to want to  
**[0:54:21-0:54:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:54:21):**  flower unless they get those extra days, those extra hours of sunlight.  
**[0:54:25-0:54:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:54:25):**  Yeah, because what happens is they're programmed to...  
**[0:54:28-0:54:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:54:28):**  They think winter is coming and that long day doesn't come.  
**[0:54:32-0:54:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:54:32):**  They still think winter is coming so they're afraid of shooting their babies in the winter  
**[0:54:36-0:54:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:54:36):**  and dying, you know.  
**[0:54:40-0:54:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:54:40):**  Very interesting.  
**[0:54:41-0:54:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:54:41):**  Anyway, listen.  
**[0:54:42-0:54:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:54:42):**  It's like it's smart, you know, they're super smart, you know.  
**[0:54:46-0:54:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:54:46):**  It gets triggered like, oh, it's where as spring comes and it's entering summer, you  
**[0:54:52-0:54:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:54:52):**  know, it's like, oh, we've moved past the 14 hours of daylight.  
**[0:54:56-0:55:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:54:56):**  It's a trigger that says, hey, you know, we're entering summer, long summer.  
**[0:55:00-0:55:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:55:00):**  So this is the time to start blooming and start producing your seeds so you can throw  
**[0:55:04-0:55:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:55:04):**  them out in the fall so then they can get covered in snow and be warm through the soil.  
**[0:55:11-0:55:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:55:11):**  So then when the spring comes they can sprout.  
**[0:55:13-0:55:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:55:13):**  And if they start blooming in the fall and the winter kills the bloom, you know, it's  
**[0:55:20-0:55:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:55:20):**  like they didn't even have time to reproduce the seeds.  
**[0:55:24-0:55:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:55:24):**  Correct.  
**[0:55:25-0:55:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:55:25):**  I mean, this is all, you know, this reminds me of the book I read on plant intelligence  
**[0:55:31-0:55:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:55:31):**  or on a couple of...  
**[0:55:36-0:55:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:55:36):**  You know what, I can't think of the name of it right now, but I'll put it up on the website  
**[0:55:40-0:55:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:55:40):**  and I'll send it to you.  
**[0:55:42-0:55:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:55:42):**  It's a book called Plant Intelligence.  
**[0:55:44-0:55:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:55:44):**  Also Rupert Sheldrake talks about it in his stuff on morphic resonance, which is the idea  
**[0:55:49-0:55:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:55:49):**  that plants are actually aware of what's going on.  
**[0:55:52-0:55:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:55:52):**  Yeah, they're very aware.  
**[0:55:56-0:56:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:55:56):**  Which I feel like you really, everyone who gardens sort of intuitively understands that.  
**[0:56:02-0:56:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:56:02):**  Sounds good.  
**[0:56:04-0:56:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:56:04):**  But anyway, listen, Alex, it's been great to talk to you.  
**[0:56:10-0:56:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:56:10):**  And thanks a million for joining us and I'll talk, I'll see you this weekend actually.  
**[0:56:15-0:56:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:56:15):**  Okay, sounds good.  
**[0:56:17-0:56:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:56:17):**  We'll have a good time.  
**[0:56:18-0:56:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:56:18):**  All right, buddy.  
**[0:56:19-0:56:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:56:19):**  Talk to you soon.  
**[0:56:20-0:56:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:56:20):**  Okay, man.  
**[0:56:21-0:56:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:56:21):**  Bye.  
**[0:56:22-0:56:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:56:22):**  So before we wrap up this show for the week, I've got some exciting news about the upcoming  
**[0:56:25-0:56:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:56:25):**  months.  
**[0:56:26-0:56:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:56:26):**  And I'm joined here now with my good friend and founder of Atitlan Organics, Shad Goodsy.  
**[0:56:30-0:56:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:56:30):**  Hey buddy, what's new?  
**[0:56:32-0:56:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:56:32):**  Oh man, so much is happening.  
**[0:56:35-0:56:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:56:35):**  First off though, I just want to say thanks for having me, man.  
**[0:56:37-0:56:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:56:37):**  I really love your podcast and I actually had a great time doing that interview back  
**[0:56:41-0:56:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:56:41):**  in one of the earlier episodes.  
**[0:56:43-0:56:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:56:43):**  Anyway, probably what's most exciting is our new collaboration between Atitlan Organics  
**[0:56:48-0:56:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:56:48):**  and Abundant Edge.  
**[0:56:50-0:56:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:56:50):**  As you know, we've been offering permaculture design courses for over six years now and  
**[0:56:54-0:56:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:56:54):**  they really have become a staple here in Lake Atitlan.  
**[0:56:58-0:57:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:56:58):**  In particular though, the intro to permaculture course is just an amazing way for travelers,  
**[0:57:03-0:57:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:57:03):**  gardeners, architects, basically anyone to fully immerse themselves in this new paradigm  
**[0:57:09-0:57:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:57:09):**  of permaculture design.  
**[0:57:10-0:57:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:57:10):**  Like honestly, you can't take this course and still see the world the same way afterward.  
**[0:57:16-0:57:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:57:16):**  Yeah, that's for sure.  
**[0:57:17-0:57:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:57:17):**  It's life changing.  
**[0:57:18-0:57:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:57:18):**  But like I said, what I'm most excited about is that now, thanks to our collaboration,  
**[0:57:23-0:57:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:57:23):**  we're going to be able to offer your natural building course immediately after every one  
**[0:57:28-0:57:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:57:28):**  of our intro to permaculture courses.  
**[0:57:31-0:57:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:57:31):**  Literally, this two week offering is like possibly the most complete package that I  
**[0:57:36-0:57:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:57:36):**  know of available anywhere.  
**[0:57:39-0:57:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:57:39):**  Basically with these two courses alone, I think that someone should have everything  
**[0:57:43-0:57:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:57:43):**  they need to start their own regenerative project or just their own regenerative lifestyle.  
**[0:57:49-0:57:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:57:49):**  That's what I'm excited about, man.  
**[0:57:50-0:57:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:57:50):**  But yeah, what about you?  
**[0:57:52-0:57:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:57:52):**  What's going on?  
**[0:57:53-0:57:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:57:53):**  Man, well, you know already that me and the Abundant Edge team are gearing up for a big  
**[0:57:57-0:57:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:57:57):**  season as well.  
**[0:57:58-0:58:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:57:58):**  I mean, starting in November, we'll be breaking ground on a regenerative farming demonstration  
**[0:58:03-0:58:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:58:03):**  site, which is of course right down the hill from your farm.  
**[0:58:06-0:58:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:58:06):**  We'll be building animal pens, a classroom, outdoor kitchens and lounge areas connected  
**[0:58:11-0:58:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:58:11):**  to houses.  
**[0:58:13-0:58:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:58:13):**  And it's all going to be made out of natural materials.  
**[0:58:15-0:58:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:58:15):**  I mean, the site is going to serve as a demonstration farm for perennial and regenerative farming  
**[0:58:20-0:58:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:58:20):**  methods for years and years to come.  
**[0:58:22-0:58:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:58:22):**  And we'll even be offering courses and internship opportunities to people who want to learn  
**[0:58:26-0:58:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:58:26):**  for themselves about how to build with natural materials and set up their own farms.  
**[0:58:31-0:58:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:58:31):**  Heck yeah, that sounds amazing, man.  
**[0:58:34-0:58:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:58:34):**  And honestly, this is just about the best place in the world to learn all these things  
**[0:58:38-0:58:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:58:38):**  too.  
**[0:58:39-0:58:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:58:39):**  I mean, this little town of Sununah in the gorgeous tropical mountains of Guatemala,  
**[0:58:43-0:58:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:58:43):**  like right here on the shores of Lake Atitlan, it's one of the most beautiful places in the  
**[0:58:47-0:58:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:58:47):**  world.  
**[0:58:48-0:58:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:58:48):**  And on top of that, you have this traditional indigenous Mayan culture that's still rich  
**[0:58:52-0:58:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:58:52):**  and alive.  
**[0:58:53-0:58:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:58:53):**  And probably my favorite part is that we have this world international community of alternative  
**[0:58:59-0:59:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:58:59):**  people that are open to new ideas and really putting things into practice.  
**[0:59:04-0:59:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:59:04):**  I mean, within walking distance of the bamboo guest house, you've got loads of things going  
**[0:59:08-0:59:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:59:08):**  on.  
**[0:59:09-0:59:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:59:09):**  We got the projects that we've already talked about, but you also have yoga retreat centers.  
**[0:59:13-0:59:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:59:13):**  You have Charlie Rendell's natural bamboo building school.  
**[0:59:16-0:59:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:59:16):**  You have Love Probiotics, you got Fungi Academy and honestly loads more alternative blow your  
**[0:59:22-0:59:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:59:22):**  mind type stuff.  
**[0:59:23-0:59:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:59:23):**  I honestly just feel like this is where it's all happening.  
**[0:59:26-0:59:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:59:26):**  Yeah, it really does.  
**[0:59:28-0:59:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:59:28):**  And I want to get as many people as possible in on these projects, but we've got to make  
**[0:59:32-0:59:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:59:32):**  sure that they've got the skills first.  
**[0:59:34-0:59:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:59:34):**  So what do you say?  
**[0:59:35-0:59:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:59:35):**  Let's offer a big discount to those who sign up for both courses.  
**[0:59:38-0:59:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:59:38):**  I mean, all food and lodging and the amazing bamboo guest house is already included in  
**[0:59:42-0:59:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:59:42):**  the tuition.  
**[0:59:43-0:59:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:59:43):**  So this will be like the best deal that we've ever offered.  
**[0:59:46-0:59:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:59:46):**  That's a great idea because I mean, people can still take just one course if that's what  
**[0:59:50-0:59:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:59:50):**  they're into or if they can't make the full two weeks, but this will actually make the  
**[0:59:54-0:59:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:59:54):**  two courses more accessible to even a wider audience of people.  
**[0:59:58-1:00:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=0:59:58):**  That way more people can get the knowledge that they need to get started doing what they  
**[1:00:02-1:00:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=1:00:02):**  want to do.  
**[1:00:04-1:00:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=1:00:04):**  So hey, to all of you listening out there, we really want passionate and driven people  
**[1:00:08-1:00:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=1:00:08):**  like you to come and be a part of the community and the ecosystem that we're building out  
**[1:00:12-1:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=1:00:12):**  here.  
**[1:00:13-1:00:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=1:00:13):**  So if you're ready to take the next step and really dive in, there's no better time to  
**[1:00:16-1:00:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-from-caoba-farms/#t=1:00:16):**  invest in yourself by joining us on this journey to a regenerative future.

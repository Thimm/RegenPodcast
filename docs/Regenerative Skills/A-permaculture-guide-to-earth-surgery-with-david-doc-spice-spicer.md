### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 25 Sep 2020 07:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:00:09):**  You're in the right place for all things regenerative living, ecological restoration,  
**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:00:14):**  permaculture and natural building.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:00:16):**  I'm your host Oliver Gaucher.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:00:18):**  In this show, it's my job to interview leaders, innovators and rebels on the cutting edge  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:00:22):**  of their fields as we look for solutions to our generation's most urgent challenges  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:00:27):**  and share these techniques and information so that you can join us in creating a healthy  
**[0:00:31-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:00:31):**  and abundant world for everyone.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:00:33):**  So let's get started.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:00:40):**  Without a doubt, the most important mission of our lifetimes will be regenerating this  
**[0:00:44-0:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:00:44):**  planet and creating a new culture based on care and stewardship for all life.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:00:50):**  But it can be hard to know where to start.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:00:52):**  After more than 150 episodes of speaking to leaders and innovators in the regenerative  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:00:56):**  fields around the world, and working with clients and organizations to help them reach  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:01:00):**  their regenerative goals, I've compiled many lists of essential skills and steps that  
**[0:01:05-0:01:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:01:05):**  anyone can take today to begin their journey towards a brighter future for themselves,  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:01:10):**  their families and communities, and for the ecosystems that support them.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:01:14):**  Every two weeks, I'll send you a new regenerative skill that you can develop and expand on in  
**[0:01:18-0:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:01:18):**  your own life right away.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:01:20):**  What's more is that I'm creating a community of skill builders like you who are sharing  
**[0:01:24-0:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:01:24):**  their results and stories of success to inspire you towards greater action.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:01:29):**  You can sign up right now in the show notes for this episode or on the homepage at AbundantEdge.com.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:01:35):**  Start your week off right by building your skills for a regenerative future.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:01:39):**  All right, welcome back everybody.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:01:42):**  Now this week is going to tie in perfectly with last week's interview with Zach Weiss  
**[0:01:46-0:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:01:46):**  about building ponds and water harvesting features.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:01:48):**  Now I spoke with David Spicer, who is affectionately known as Doc Spice, an accomplished permaculture  
**[0:01:54-0:01:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:01:54):**  designer who has specialized in earthworks installation.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:01:58):**  Having taught and worked on various projects extensively in Australia and internationally  
**[0:02:03-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:02:03):**  in places like Morocco, Jordan, Palestine, and New Caledonia, Doc has worked in a broad  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:02:09):**  array of different soil types, topographies, and climate zones too.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:02:14):**  He's also a valued member of the permaculture sustainable consulting team headed up by Jeff  
**[0:02:18-0:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:02:18):**  Lawton and is registered as teacher number five with the Permaculture Research Institute  
**[0:02:23-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:02:23):**  of Australia.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:02:25):**  Now Doc is a master of practical and logical mainframe permaculture design and he has pioneered  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:02:30):**  the design of water harvesting and storage earthworks, which frames all regenerative  
**[0:02:35-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:02:35):**  farming.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:02:36):**  In this episode specifically, we talk about why it's so important to invest early on a  
**[0:02:41-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:02:41):**  project to get your earthworks right because of what it can mean for the health of your  
**[0:02:45-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:02:45):**  land.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:02:46):**  Doc also shares some insights on his personal design process and what he looks for in a  
**[0:02:51-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:02:51):**  landscape to give him clues as to the most effective interventions on the form of the  
**[0:02:56-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:02:56):**  land.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:02:57):**  We also cover some of the risks of improperly installed features, the need to draw from  
**[0:03:02-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:03:02):**  as many sources of knowledge as possible, and he also gives some valuable advice for  
**[0:03:07-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:03:07):**  people who are new to earthworks on how to get started.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:03:10):**  Now I've put some pictures of the projects that Doc has done to help to illustrate some  
**[0:03:14-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:03:14):**  of the concepts and techniques that he talks about, so don't forget to check out these  
**[0:03:19-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:03:19):**  along with further links on the show notes in this episode on the website.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:03:23):**  And now I'll hand things over to Doc Spice.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:03:26):**  Hey Doc, thanks so much for making time today for being on the podcast.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:03:29):**  It's really a pleasure to finally speak to you.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:03:31):**  I've followed your work for a while.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:03:33):**  How are you doing in Australia at the moment?  
**[0:03:34-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:03:34):**  Good mate, in the middle of winter, but I'm sitting on a nice rocket mass heater, so I've  
**[0:03:41-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:03:41):**  got warm bones.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:03:42):**  Oh, perfect.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:03:43):**  That's nice, man.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:03:44):**  Those things are fantastic.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:03:45):**  I got to get back and do another interview about those things.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:03:49):**  I just got a new book on rocket mass heaters from Erica Wisener and Ernie Wisener called  
**[0:03:54-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:03:54):**  the Rocket Mass Heater Builders Guide.  
**[0:03:57-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:03:57):**  It's a really good volume.  
**[0:03:58-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:03:58):**  I recommend it.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:03:59):**  How's that one performing for you?  
**[0:04:01-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:04:01):**  Did you build it yourself?  
**[0:04:02-0:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:04:02):**  Yeah, I built it myself.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:04:04):**  I actually added the firebox to it, like the batch box sort of mass heaters, but look,  
**[0:04:10-0:04:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:04:10):**  it's incredible.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:04:11):**  It's transformed the house.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:04:12):**  It's reduced our firewood costs by 40%, 50%, depending on the year and the wood  
**[0:04:18-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:04:18):**  quality.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:04:19):**  But it's just incredible.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:04:20):**  We love it.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:04:21):**  Yeah, so you added on the batch box feature.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:04:24):**  See, I started doing that when I was doing stoves in Guatemala, and it makes a really  
**[0:04:28-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:04:28):**  big difference, doesn't it?  
**[0:04:30-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:04:30):**  It does in the sort of management of it.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:04:33):**  You can put more wood in.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:04:36):**  You don't have to constantly be attending it.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:04:38):**  Exactly, mate.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:04:39):**  Exactly.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:04:40):**  It's more functional, more practical.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:04:42):**  It's incredible.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:04:43):**  Well, look, I would love to talk rocket mass heaters with you this whole time, but what  
**[0:04:48-0:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:04:48):**  do you say we get to what you're best known for, which is earthworks and landscape transformation?  
**[0:04:55-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:04:55):**  Now, I know that landform is the second highest category on the scale of permanence, and regular  
**[0:05:01-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:05:01):**  listeners to this podcast will have heard me talk about the scale of permanence quite  
**[0:05:05-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:05:05):**  a bit.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:05:06):**  But my question for you is, why is it so important to invest early and really get it right with  
**[0:05:11-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:05:11):**  the landform aspect as far as the health of your land as you start to move forward with  
**[0:05:16-0:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:05:16):**  your design?  
**[0:05:17-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:05:17):**  Well, you know, I suppose I see what I do and any sort of manipulating landforms, because  
**[0:05:27-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:05:27):**  that's what I do basically, is I try to do the smallest amount of work for the greatest  
**[0:05:33-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:05:33):**  good.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:05:34):**  I see that as, or I like to explain it as you're building the bones of the system,  
**[0:05:41-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:05:41):**  and then all the living flesh is the muscle and the skin, et cetera.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:05:47):**  And that's how I see earthworks.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:05:49):**  But sort of reading the landscape is really the first sort of critical point.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:05:54):**  Observation I think is the most important skill set.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:05:59):**  If you want to transform landscape, particularly in an earthworks manner, you need to develop  
**[0:06:07-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:06:07):**  your observation skills to look at land, to look at the shape of it, erosion patterns,  
**[0:06:15-0:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:06:15):**  et cetera.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:06:16):**  To work out what's going on.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:06:19):**  What's the most economical fix, the bang for your buck that you can do?  
**[0:06:26-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:06:26):**  Because everything I do costs a lot of money when you're dealing with heavy machinery.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:06:30):**  So you've got to be trying to be quite precise with your movements.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:06:34):**  Yeah.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:06:35):**  And I've heard that echoed from a lot of people, especially because it is so high on that  
**[0:06:40-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:06:40):**  scale of permanence.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:06:41):**  We're dealing with things that are quite difficult to make any real change on without larger  
**[0:06:46-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:06:46):**  equipment or without a ton of manpower.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:06:49):**  And you're talking about the observation process and there's a lot of things on the  
**[0:06:53-0:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:06:53):**  landscape that you need to take into account before you start going in and doing some work.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:06:59):**  Tell me, how do you assess a new site for its water harvesting potential?  
**[0:07:04-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:07:04):**  What are some of the things that you look for first?  
**[0:07:06-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:07:06):**  Well, absolutely one I look for is any roads above the site.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:07:12):**  Because if you can get that, that is absolutely gold in the run-off events coming off Sealed  
**[0:07:18-0:07:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:07:18):**  Roads particularly.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:07:20):**  I'm looking at where is sort of—is there any neighbouring properties that run in?  
**[0:07:28-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:07:28):**  Where's the biggest catchment coming in from the different valleys?  
**[0:07:33-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:07:33):**  You've got to look at also landscape and what was the—how was the site treated?  
**[0:07:39-0:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:07:39):**  It has got rock formations.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:07:43):**  And even I've been working on a site in Jindjelic.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:07:46):**  Now that's quite a big country in that it's from the valley floor to the ridge at 600  
**[0:07:52-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:07:52):**  metres and almost on a 70% grade.  
**[0:07:57-0:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:07:57):**  It's an incredibly steep country.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:07:59):**  But rock formations has made a big difference in its shale country.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:08:04):**  But if the rock strata is standing up, it actually builds quite incredible fertile soil  
**[0:08:10-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:08:10):**  and very little run-off.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:08:11):**  But as soon as the rock strata changes, everything just sheds off.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:08:15):**  And that's in the sections that the water is shedding off, we're doing a lot of what  
**[0:08:21-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:08:21):**  I call shock absorber work in putting water into a swale system, really so it can just  
**[0:08:27-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:08:27):**  take its energy out and then passively overflow its fillway.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:08:33):**  And also when you do that, you're allowed to deposit to become a deposition system and  
**[0:08:38-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:08:38):**  build soil and bank the water.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:08:43):**  I think is the site forested?  
**[0:08:48-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:08:48):**  What are the land practices above the site in the water catchment?  
**[0:08:53-0:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:08:53):**  What are the farmers doing above it?  
**[0:08:54-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:08:54):**  It's a big one to think about.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:08:58):**  In Australia we've got to think that in February we had horrendous fires and on this  
**[0:09:03-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:09:03):**  site in Jindjelic the fire went through.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:09:06):**  So there was an incredible amount of material that moved through these landscapes after  
**[0:09:13-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:09:13):**  the fire and some big rain events.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:09:14):**  So we've had a lot of work to do there.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:09:18):**  But at the same time the site, the client's been doing holistic grazing for four years.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:09:24):**  And there's still almost an inch of organic matter on the soil after the fire had passed  
**[0:09:30-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:09:30):**  in certain places as a testament to the benefits of these grazing systems.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:09:39):**  But also how resilient nature is.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:09:40):**  I always like to say we've only got to take one step in the right direction and nature  
**[0:09:43-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:09:43):**  takes 10.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:09:44):**  And I've seen that so many times and often that can be planting the water or interacting  
**[0:09:51-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:09:51):**  with livestock or anything like that in a positive manner.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:09:56):**  Yeah and like you said, we're talking a lot about water systems when we're dealing  
**[0:10:01-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:10:01):**  with earthworks because that's often the main intention of why someone would bring  
**[0:10:05-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:10:05):**  in heavy machinery and make adjustments in the land.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:10:09):**  But let's talk about the full range of what a properly planned and implemented earthworks  
**[0:10:13-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:10:13):**  project has the potential to do in transforming a landscape, both including water catchment  
**[0:10:20-0:10:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:10:20):**  and any of the other services that you've been able to do with this type of work.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:10:24):**  Yeah look I think basically we've got to become human beavers.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:10:34):**  I think like yes we can bring in—first we've got to have an observation on the landscape.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:10:39):**  Look at a rain event and look where the water's moving on site.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:10:43):**  And there's a whole host of indicators to that too.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:10:47):**  Has there been any organic debris put up in trees or on fence lines because that's an  
**[0:10:52-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:10:52):**  indicator.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:10:53):**  Is there any steps in the country?  
**[0:10:56-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:10:56):**  Slump country you have to worry about, like dispersive clays.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:11:01):**  And again that's observation because you can look at the profile and see that that  
**[0:11:07-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:11:07):**  doesn't quite look right.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:11:09):**  But we need to start at the top and slowly impound the water.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:11:13):**  Now obviously most economical place is the soil.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:11:17):**  So we can bank it in the soil then we've spent the least amount of time, money and energy  
**[0:11:23-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:11:23):**  often to store that water.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:11:25):**  Now if we store that water high and you know we'll eventually be creating new springs.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:11:33):**  And I've seen that across so many sites when we bank the water up high.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:11:37):**  And it doesn't have to be with earthworks but just good land management.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:11:42):**  Even take a degraded forest and start cycling that down.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:11:47):**  The lesser quality species in that forest and start cycling that down on a contoured  
**[0:11:52-0:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:11:52):**  form or a key line form.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:11:54):**  You're going to start banking huge amounts of water in that.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:11:57):**  So water retention doesn't have to be just about earth, big scale earthworks too.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:12:03):**  It's surprising what can be achieved by hand you know when it comes to earthworks and just  
**[0:12:11-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:12:11):**  planting that water and Brad Lancaster has been incredible in leading that sort of path  
**[0:12:16-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:12:16):**  for years really.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:12:17):**  You know he's one of my sort of heroes I suppose like you know and such a gentle guy.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:12:23):**  And so I think you know we need to you know like I come into this game is from a permaculture's  
**[0:12:28-0:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:12:28):**  perspective and we need not to be permacultist.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:12:32):**  I sort of really try seriously to always take on new information and if I see something  
**[0:12:38-0:12:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:12:38):**  that works I add it to the toolkit.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:12:43):**  You know like in Australia we have Peter Andrews doing natural sequence farming which is great  
**[0:12:48-0:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:12:48):**  but that's only for the flood plains you know whereas we need to apply you know we wouldn't  
**[0:12:53-0:12:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:12:53):**  need to force water out onto ridge points to rehydrate them.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:12:59):**  So you know there's so many from large scale to small scale scenarios that we can take  
**[0:13:06-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:13:06):**  on to hold more water in the landscape.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:13:12):**  And it's just it takes just a little bit of will and a little bit of knowledge and trial  
**[0:13:16-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:13:16):**  and error you know we need to our education system in the western world particularly I  
**[0:13:20-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:13:20):**  think you know they've knocked innovation out of us and we're scared to fail.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:13:28):**  Whereas so you don't want to fail definitely on large scale earthworks and that's where  
**[0:13:32-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:13:32):**  laser levels and surveying is critical before earthworks during and after.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:13:41):**  But you know like the smaller scale stuff is stuff to really play with and build up  
**[0:13:47-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:13:47):**  your confidence and your understanding.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:13:49):**  Water is very easy to work with you know I don't see myself as you know unique in my  
**[0:13:57-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:13:57):**  smartness for what I do I don't I just understand that water if you hold water on level or you  
**[0:14:03-0:14:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:14:03):**  put a slight fall on it but if you run it in storage it's just a matter of playing with  
**[0:14:08-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:14:08):**  heights to get water to go where you want.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:14:10):**  I can get water to run into it and then back flood up and that's just in relation to heights  
**[0:14:16-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:14:16):**  you know by surveying you know.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:14:20):**  So you know really yeah it's good like that like water is very predictable it very rarely  
**[0:14:25-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:14:25):**  does anything that you couldn't have planned for.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:14:28):**  Yeah yeah in a water harvesting storage in the landscape certainly when it becomes too  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:14:33):**  sort of you know creek systems well they're more volatile and you know I've played with  
**[0:14:38-0:14:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:14:38):**  that sort of leaky weir idea but I'm certainly not an expert on that like you know I suppose  
**[0:14:43-0:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:14:43):**  I've become more knowledgeable on you know actual jumping on the machine like doing the  
**[0:14:49-0:14:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:14:49):**  design jumping on the machine and actually doing the work and I've learned a lot by doing  
**[0:14:54-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:14:54):**  the work myself on the escalator.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:14:58):**  It's a bit bone rattling it's hard work and but you know the results are quite incredible  
**[0:15:06-0:15:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:15:06):**  you know and the work I've done in Morocco has been for me very rewarding.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:15:14):**  One of the projects I've worked on was in the High Atlas and so we only had a JCB and  
**[0:15:19-0:15:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:15:19):**  we've done a swell as a shock absorber so reading the landscape it was like 60 degrees  
**[0:15:24-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:15:24):**  slope coming down to the school and it flooded on a 250mm rainfall like per annum but the  
**[0:15:32-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:15:32):**  school was flooded which is kind of hard to believe in a 250mm rainfall you know yearly  
**[0:15:38-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:15:38):**  event like over the annual year but like by doing that and also doing smaller scale stuff  
**[0:15:47-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:15:47):**  this kids have actually taken that skill set to their own farms and that is just fantastic  
**[0:15:55-0:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:15:55):**  that is fantastic by demonstration you know the word educate in Latin means to lead out  
**[0:16:01-0:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:16:01):**  to demonstrate the way and I think that's the most important thing that we can do we  
**[0:16:06-0:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:16:06):**  can talk all we want but we really need to start demonstrating and showing people how  
**[0:16:09-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:16:09):**  simple what we do is and it's fun you know and it's so powerful to build life systems  
**[0:16:20-0:16:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:16:20):**  because that's what we're doing yeah life systems you know and we're just becoming we're  
**[0:16:26-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:16:26):**  coming in as the initiator and just a traffic director really like pruning a tree it's just  
**[0:16:33-0:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:16:33):**  steering traffic and I think looking at a whole system looking at the overall site is  
**[0:16:37-0:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:16:37):**  like steering traffic now if you start with water and you work out where the water is  
**[0:16:44-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:16:44):**  going where you can store the water where you can move the water and then that gives  
**[0:16:49-0:16:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:16:49):**  you your bones of your structures and you can put your roads on and your structure position  
**[0:16:54-0:17:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:16:54):**  and your fence layout or your forestry layout it really for me what earthworks and I think  
**[0:17:01-0:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:17:01):**  the simple thing about them does is once you put earthworks layer on your site it designs  
**[0:17:06-0:17:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:17:06):**  itself because it already starts to cut it into sections you know you can start to know  
**[0:17:12-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:17:12):**  oh that's done right right that's zone four that's forestry you know what I mean like  
**[0:17:16-0:17:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:17:16):**  that's it really starts to divide land up and so much easier for people to manage I  
**[0:17:23-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:17:23):**  think because particularly people new to farming not necessarily old farmers people new to  
**[0:17:32-0:17:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:17:32):**  farming homesteading all that when you look at a big space with no trees on it and it's  
**[0:17:37-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:17:37):**  a big blank canvas it's really hard to envision what is possible and where to stop and start  
**[0:17:44-0:17:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:17:44):**  and I think the most powerful things that right good earthworks can do is it sections  
**[0:17:50-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:17:50):**  up the land now Mark Shepherd I was watching a podcast the other day of Mark and he's given  
**[0:17:55-0:18:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:17:55):**  a key line presentation and he talks about this sweet spot which I absolutely agree with  
**[0:18:00-0:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:18:00):**  because I'm finding the more design work I do there's this sweet spot often in the middle  
**[0:18:06-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:18:06):**  of the site depending on topography and shape you know but if we do our research and we  
**[0:18:12-0:18:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:18:12):**  we can purchase a property with a bit of topography then you can find this sweet spot that it's  
**[0:18:19-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:18:19):**  the least amount of earthworks for the greatest amount of water harvesting and often storage  
**[0:18:24-0:18:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:18:24):**  potential whether that could be a gradient road or I'm starting actually a lot more terracing  
**[0:18:31-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:18:31):**  in the form of swales so they're on level but they're in a form of the terrace with  
**[0:18:35-0:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:18:35):**  the tilt on so they're almost up the firm yeah three four hundred mil in the freeboard  
**[0:18:43-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:18:43):**  so on the bottom in bottom side of the terrace is 400 millimeters higher than the back of  
**[0:18:51-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:18:51):**  the terrace so that's where the water sits like a swale but I'm just finding I'm evolving  
**[0:18:56-0:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:18:56):**  my system because I'm finding that terrace this terrace form it's easier to maintain  
**[0:19:01-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:19:01):**  over time than the classic squire form yeah but I'm also doing yeah I could definitely  
**[0:19:08-0:19:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:19:08):**  see that yeah no they really are I'm really finding that so you know even though I come  
**[0:19:12-0:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:19:12):**  in as a permaculturist and you know I just see like Zach Wees's work you know the elemental  
**[0:19:18-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:19:18):**  ecology ecosystems like it's just fantastic stuff and you've got to go wow that works  
**[0:19:24-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:19:24):**  Peter Andrews systems works you know Brad Lancaster's, Mark Sheppard's, Darren Doherty's  
**[0:19:28-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:19:28):**  you know we just we need to collect as much you know stuff that we gel with and just try  
**[0:19:36-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:19:36):**  it on a small scale and build our confidence to go out in big scales you know start small  
**[0:19:45-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:19:45):**  make small mistakes it's a big thing.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:19:49):**  Yeah absolutely yeah that's classic and very good advice and one of the things that you  
**[0:19:54-0:19:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:19:54):**  mentioned just a minute ago about building these skills and adding more of them from  
**[0:19:58-0:20:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:19:58):**  the toolboxes of as wide of a I guess spread of learning and pedagogies as you can really  
**[0:20:06-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:20:06):**  helps to continue the innovation process and I'm wondering in all of this time that you've  
**[0:20:12-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:20:12):**  been learning and practicing these types of designs and implementing them what are some  
**[0:20:17-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:20:17):**  of the most useful skills that you end up using all of the time and that are fairly  
**[0:20:23-0:20:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:20:23):**  easy for someone else to pick up?  
**[0:20:30-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:20:30):**  Assuming that there's some overlap on those because you might be using pretty complex  
**[0:20:33-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:20:33):**  skills.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:20:34):**  No no no I think like obse honestly observation observation read landscapes you know that  
**[0:20:41-0:20:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:20:41):**  is a real big thing like walk the you know as Warren Brush would say walk the water you  
**[0:20:49-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:20:49):**  know you need to get in the water's mine.  
**[0:20:54-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:20:54):**  Think about don't just think about the earthworks aspect because what you if you're not careful  
**[0:21:00-0:21:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:21:00):**  you cut the property off you know what I mean you can't access it once you put in whether  
**[0:21:06-0:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:21:06):**  it's swales or gradient roads you know you've got a path across there but you can't go up  
**[0:21:11-0:21:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:21:11):**  the slope so you've got to think about access think about fence layering you know I always  
**[0:21:18-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:21:18):**  advise do a little bit and then come back and do more it might cost you more for the  
**[0:21:22-0:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:21:22):**  transport but you've got to allow you know the system to evolve.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:21:26):**  Bill said let your site demonstrate its evolution you know and that's really true like but I  
**[0:21:32-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:21:32):**  think observation honestly observation get a shovel learn how to move a bit of earth  
**[0:21:41-0:21:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:21:41):**  play with small systems like play with stormwater yeah get as many like I'm very unique I suppose  
**[0:21:50-0:21:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:21:50):**  I've been lucky or you know in some ways I grew up on a farm I worked in horticulture  
**[0:21:56-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:21:56):**  I've worked in forestry I've worked in the building industry bit of steel fabrication  
**[0:22:01-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:22:01):**  forestry before I come to permaculture yeah before I was even into interested in it so  
**[0:22:07-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:22:07):**  I was very lucky to have a broad array of skill sets try to get some practical experience  
**[0:22:13-0:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:22:13):**  on working systems working tree systems you know because if you're designing you need  
**[0:22:19-0:22:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:22:19):**  to design with you know the evolution of tree systems spacing access and that's where Darren  
**[0:22:25-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:22:25):**  does such a fantastic job in the rigarian system you know keeping it quite simple adapt  
**[0:22:36-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:22:36):**  you know be adaptive don't don't if you've designed something don't be egotistical and  
**[0:22:42-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:22:42):**  go I can't change that because you're eager you know be a bit humble yeah I don't like  
**[0:22:51-0:22:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:22:51):**  to cry we need people to get out there and bloody try you know because you know Bill  
**[0:22:56-0:22:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:22:56):**  said yeah get out there and try and because we can't do a worse job well that's true to  
**[0:22:59-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:22:59):**  an extent certainly you know but we need to become more active and demonstrate yeah yeah  
**[0:23:06-0:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:23:06):**  yeah yeah put these things into practice and get away from the theory and get your hands  
**[0:23:13-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:23:13):**  dirty yeah no look you know I yeah I'd like to get myself into a position where I could  
**[0:23:18-0:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:23:18):**  take on people to train them because I have people asking me to come on site so and evolution  
**[0:23:24-0:23:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:23:24):**  because I know we need them I know we need people with this skill set and I really think  
**[0:23:29-0:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:23:29):**  you need to get try to apprentice yourself to someone for the training because there's  
**[0:23:35-0:23:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:23:35):**  no substitute for experience you know even if it's if you want to work with machine heavy  
**[0:23:41-0:23:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:23:41):**  machinery you know try to jump on and operate because what that does if you want to work  
**[0:23:49-0:23:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:23:49):**  with earthworks it gives you a realization is that design reality or not because it's  
**[0:23:54-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:23:54):**  too easy to draw a pretty picture and go let's do that but until you actually get on the  
**[0:24:01-0:24:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:24:01):**  ground and start implementing it or you come from a operator's perspective and go oh wow  
**[0:24:07-0:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:24:07):**  that's going to be really costly because you know you've got to cut so much out of there  
**[0:24:10-0:24:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:24:10):**  to get that like be a bit pragmatic think of people's dollar because everything we do  
**[0:24:15-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:24:15):**  with heavy machinery is costly so we need to try to minimize the the amount of time  
**[0:24:23-0:24:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:24:23):**  and cubic meters of earth moved for impact for water stored is the big one just question  
**[0:24:31-0:24:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:24:31):**  that each time you're doing that you know am I putting this are you doing it to do it  
**[0:24:37-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:24:37):**  or are you doing it with a real goal exactly my having the desired effect yeah and that's  
**[0:24:41-0:24:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:24:41):**  why like I say this mainframe concept because if you can get a mainframe and that's if you  
**[0:24:47-0:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:24:47):**  think of ridge to valley floor if you can get something across the top of the ridge  
**[0:24:51-0:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:24:51):**  line before it starts getting steep and something through the mid slope picking up the key point  
**[0:24:58-0:25:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:24:58):**  and whether that's swale gradient road whatever with dam storage and then something in the  
**[0:25:02-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:25:02):**  bottom that's enough to kick your system off and you can always put in more when you do  
**[0:25:07-0:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:25:07):**  your observation and have more experience with that site but you know there's no point  
**[0:25:12-0:25:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:25:12):**  in putting in swale swale swale why you know why not just rip it yes put in swales if you  
**[0:25:19-0:25:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:25:19):**  want to harvest water to somewhere but if you just want to bank the water it could be  
**[0:25:23-0:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:25:23):**  other options other than bringing in heavy machinery these days I rarely put in a swale  
**[0:25:31-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:25:31):**  as a as an individual unit I'll put in a swale as a back floods swale so it's connected to  
**[0:25:37-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:25:37):**  a dam so the swap the dam has to fill from the swale before the swale fills up okay so  
**[0:25:45-0:25:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:25:45):**  I will do that but I rarely put in a swale just to put in a swale because unless I want  
**[0:25:53-0:25:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:25:53):**  to pick water up bring it around the ridge and drop it off again unless I want to direct  
**[0:25:58-0:26:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:25:58):**  water you know but because there's other options more economic options for people to impound  
**[0:26:04-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:26:04):**  water and you know first we have to look at the soil and we have to what can we do to  
**[0:26:09-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:26:09):**  the soil so to open it up to take the water you know we always need to be asking these  
**[0:26:18-0:26:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:26:18):**  questions in my opinion yeah I completely agree and I'm really glad that you brought  
**[0:26:24-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:26:24):**  up swales because it's become sort of this controversial thing especially in permaculture  
**[0:26:28-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:26:28):**  circles where some people think that swales kind of broadly apply to just about any landscape  
**[0:26:34-0:26:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:26:34):**  and other people who steer away from them and really try and tell people like look there's  
**[0:26:38-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:26:38):**  a lot of other options swales are effective in certain contexts but not others do you  
**[0:26:44-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:26:44):**  think that it's an essential feature for water harvesting or are there situations where it  
**[0:26:49-0:26:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:26:49):**  definitely shouldn't be used yeah certainly situations where it shouldn't be used and  
**[0:26:55-0:27:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:26:55):**  it's not essential for water harvesting you can do water harvesting by diversion drains  
**[0:27:00-0:27:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:27:00):**  you can do water harvesting by gradient roads which are bloody incredible at actually directing  
**[0:27:06-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:27:06):**  water to storage so yeah there's a whole host of things that you can do before you put in  
**[0:27:14-0:27:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:27:14):**  a swale and then and then you want to ask too like how many swales do I need do I only  
**[0:27:19-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:27:19):**  need one swale because I only want to take that water and I want to bring it around to  
**[0:27:23-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:27:23):**  that dam you know yeah so they're not always relevant don't get swale centric yeah yeah  
**[0:27:32-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:27:32):**  that's that's a big thing I see it used often as like this this indication of the pedagogy  
**[0:27:38-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:27:38):**  of permaculture and the rigidity of certain certain people's thinking around because it's  
**[0:27:43-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:27:43):**  in the permaculture manual or because it was a teaching of Bill Mollison it is the only  
**[0:27:48-0:27:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:27:48):**  way to go and I really like your approach and you know I've spoken to Darren a few times  
**[0:27:53-0:27:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:27:53):**  and quite a few other people who are like yeah I mean those are those are all good things  
**[0:27:59-0:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:27:59):**  but we've learned a lot since then and there's a lot of new tools and applications and innovations  
**[0:28:04-0:28:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:28:04):**  that should be considered now that we have more information and we've got more experience  
**[0:28:09-0:28:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:28:09):**  as as a community in applying these techniques and these strategies over a lot of different  
**[0:28:15-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:28:15):**  contexts now absolutely mate spot on thank you yeah and this is why I take what I do  
**[0:28:22-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:28:22):**  as a as an evolutionary approach you know I see myself as still learning you know because  
**[0:28:30-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:28:30):**  I'm looking at you know I still watch earth movers work because I'm like oh yeah they're  
**[0:28:34-0:28:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:28:34):**  doing that oh that's interesting you know I still I'm generally interested in learning  
**[0:28:40-0:28:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:28:40):**  and I think the hybridization of all these different approaches in different contexts  
**[0:28:46-0:28:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:28:46):**  is a fantastic thing you know you know I actually give my work a form of what I call functional  
**[0:28:54-0:29:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:28:54):**  art you know because I think it's beautiful you know I do and it's functional you know  
**[0:29:00-0:29:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:29:00):**  and I pride myself when I'm doing the work on myself on a machine is I want to have a  
**[0:29:04-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:29:04):**  finished product that blends into the landscape that doesn't actually take much longer but  
**[0:29:11-0:29:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:29:11):**  you know it's beautiful but it's also got to be functional you know and I'm blending  
**[0:29:17-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:29:17):**  it with different approaches you know from from a multitude of teachers and I think we  
**[0:29:24-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:29:24):**  have to take on this this approach of opening our minds again it comes back to observation  
**[0:29:32-0:29:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:29:32):**  you know look oh wow that works why wouldn't I use that you know that's that that's certainly  
**[0:29:40-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:29:40):**  my approach and I want to continue with that approach until you know I'm an old man I can't  
**[0:29:48-0:29:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:29:48):**  walk around too much but yeah basically yeah no I'm right there with you I completely agree  
**[0:29:54-0:29:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:29:54):**  like the real joy in this for me as well is that it's a constant learning process no matter  
**[0:29:59-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:29:59):**  how good you get no matter how much experience you build you never know the whole picture  
**[0:30:04-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:30:04):**  you can never understand the living system in all of its complexity and the challenge  
**[0:30:09-0:30:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:30:09):**  then is just to keep paying attention and to constantly be observing to see you know  
**[0:30:14-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:30:14):**  what what you've missed or what continues to evolve and you know it always manages to  
**[0:30:19-0:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:30:19):**  do so in ways that you could have never entirely predicted because of all of those variables  
**[0:30:24-0:30:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:30:24):**  and elements and nuances and living systems that I just find fascinating as well totally  
**[0:30:30-0:30:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:30:30):**  agree mate totally agree I mean Bill Bill Moulton said how can you study man when you  
**[0:30:35-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:30:35):**  study a hermit you know you can't if you study something in isolation that's going to be  
**[0:30:39-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:30:39):**  different because it has all these other influences in this natural environment so you know we've  
**[0:30:45-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:30:45):**  got to continue learning like we've got to be open try not to get our ego too big keep  
**[0:30:51-0:30:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:30:51):**  a bit humble is my advice and you'll go a long way you know as my mom would say have  
**[0:30:57-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:30:57):**  manners which is another good thing but yeah look you know be open because there's so much  
**[0:31:03-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:31:03):**  stuff you know I got root last in in December I went to India for a quick consultancy and  
**[0:31:12-0:31:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:31:12):**  you know I've seen the work that an NGO in India was doing now their work was pretty  
**[0:31:16-0:31:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:31:16):**  rough in you know our sort of standards like the finished product you know not much topsoil  
**[0:31:21-0:31:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:31:21):**  or no soft oil sort of reapplied or anything like that like but the effects were absolutely  
**[0:31:27-0:31:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:31:27):**  profound you know when we started doing that broader watershed restoration you know they  
**[0:31:33-0:31:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:31:33):**  they just transformed the local village's life and I was in awe of their work you know  
**[0:31:37-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:31:37):**  I went there as a specialist but I can't criticize anything what you know anything they've done  
**[0:31:43-0:31:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:31:43):**  because it was just bloody incredible you know there's there's a few details that I  
**[0:31:48-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:31:48):**  that I pointed out that you could do but you know overall like my god you know I was just  
**[0:31:54-0:32:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:31:54):**  humbled at the scale of what these guys achieved and it was just incredible and I think we've  
**[0:32:00-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:32:00):**  got to keep humble you know humble you learn because if you're humble you're looking you're  
**[0:32:05-0:32:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:32:05):**  observing without prejudice I think is a big one yeah yeah I completely agree now I've  
**[0:32:12-0:32:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:32:12):**  got one more technical question because I think it's one of the things that people often  
**[0:32:16-0:32:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:32:16):**  look overlook when they're thinking about earthworks and you know changing the landscape  
**[0:32:21-0:32:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:32:21):**  a bit is it's usually done with the context of trying to I guess hold and store and redirect  
**[0:32:28-0:32:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:32:28):**  more water but there are quite a few contexts in which the the larger issue is inundation  
**[0:32:34-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:32:34):**  and flooding and where drainage is actually more of a pressing challenge than harvesting  
**[0:32:39-0:32:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:32:39):**  yeah can you talk about your experience with working on drainage and making sure that water  
**[0:32:43-0:32:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:32:43):**  doesn't become an erosive force yeah well look I actually I haven't done a lot of work  
**[0:32:51-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:32:51):**  on really flat country but I am just started talking to communicating with a client that  
**[0:32:57-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:32:57):**  he's got 20 acres and there's about a 200 mil fall over it so but again you know it's  
**[0:33:04-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:33:04):**  just a matter of playing with heights you can still drain the landscape and move water  
**[0:33:10-0:33:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:33:10):**  with a swale or a drain as long as you've set your heights up right so you can still  
**[0:33:16-0:33:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:33:16):**  manipulate it you know as long as one side one end's higher than the other of course  
**[0:33:22-0:33:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:33:22):**  you can push water and terraform to create higher spots or you know use a malboard plow  
**[0:33:31-0:33:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:33:31):**  or something simple you know economic get out there with your shovel you can still manipulate  
**[0:33:36-0:33:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:33:36):**  the water and just when you come to the to the point where it exits you know often if  
**[0:33:43-0:33:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:33:43):**  I'm putting in a diversion drain I think it's a good idea to actually pull that diversion  
**[0:33:47-0:33:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:33:47):**  drain up about 10 metres off the dam or something and actually make it into a swale because  
**[0:33:53-0:33:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:33:53):**  then that actually creates a deposition system so it drops its silt load so as soon as you  
**[0:33:59-0:34:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:33:59):**  take running water and you drop it into still water there goes all this energy and that  
**[0:34:04-0:34:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:34:04):**  can just passively oh sheet over some spillway which could be rock armoured if you're worried  
**[0:34:11-0:34:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:34:11):**  about volumes of water coming in like Warren Brush does a lot of rock armoring on the spillways  
**[0:34:16-0:34:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:34:16):**  and his work and that's fine you know if you've got the rock resource around but that's taken  
**[0:34:25-0:34:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:34:25):**  running water and dropping water the running water into a body of water that could be a  
**[0:34:32-0:34:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:34:32):**  silk trap like a deposition system as soon as that running water hits water there's this  
**[0:34:38-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:34:38):**  energy gone it's dissipated it's like them but like the Zuni bowls you know they go off  
**[0:34:43-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:34:43):**  that spiral sort of vortex but it's about water heating water and dissipating the energy  
**[0:34:49-0:35:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:34:49):**  yeah some wild examples for sure and you know so as soon as your water's you know passive  
**[0:35:00-0:35:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:35:00):**  then you put it over a spillway a level spillway and that could be you know 10 metres long  
**[0:35:08-0:35:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:35:08):**  and you could only have you know an inch or 25 ml of water sheeting over that at you know  
**[0:35:16-0:35:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:35:16):**  incredible you know gentle flow but a lot of volume because it's long and it's level  
**[0:35:24-0:35:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:35:24):**  so you've dissipated the energy you've dissipated it you just split it up yeah so that's pretty  
**[0:35:30-0:35:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:35:30):**  easy and that's why I say water is easy to work with if you respect it like that you  
**[0:35:36-0:35:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:35:36):**  know bring it in allow it to to deposit its load you know what it's carrying store it  
**[0:35:43-0:35:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:35:43):**  if you want when it's exits you just put it over something level so it's passive yeah  
**[0:35:49-0:35:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:35:49):**  for sure and then you don't have any problems you know a vegetated area if you can shed  
**[0:35:56-0:36:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:35:56):**  water into a vegetated area over you know a 10 metre distance or something like that  
**[0:36:01-0:36:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:36:01):**  or you know 30 feet or something like that then then you know all the energy is taken  
**[0:36:07-0:36:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:36:07):**  out you won't even bend the grass over let's talk about some of the risks if you get it  
**[0:36:12-0:36:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:36:12):**  wrong yeah are there some inherent risks or dangers if you don't know what you're doing  
**[0:36:19-0:36:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:36:19):**  and start messing around with earthworks of course have you seen anything you know catastrophic  
**[0:36:24-0:36:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:36:24):**  happen look you know dams do blow out absolutely so that's the the dam wall itself you know  
**[0:36:32-0:36:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:36:32):**  if that's not constructed right if that's not if they don't actually have what's called  
**[0:36:37-0:36:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:36:37):**  a freeboard so from the where the water sits in a dam to the top of the dam wall itself  
**[0:36:44-0:36:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:36:44):**  if there's not much freeboard and you get a big rain event water goes over the wall  
**[0:36:48-0:36:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:36:48):**  makes a small incision that keeps going that can blow out and that can be you know hundreds  
**[0:36:53-0:37:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:36:53):**  and hundreds of cubic meters of soil hopefully clay but soil moving down in in to someone  
**[0:37:04-0:37:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:37:04):**  else's property or your property and you know you can't get that material back so there  
**[0:37:08-0:37:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:37:08):**  are dangers swales and and terrorists and things like that well depending on the volume  
**[0:37:13-0:37:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:37:13):**  of water you're picking up if they blow out it's not really that much of a drama you know  
**[0:37:18-0:37:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:37:18):**  you can shovel a wheelbarrow load of material back in there but when you're dealing with  
**[0:37:23-0:37:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:37:23):**  dams diversion drains running water you have to you know stay on a gentle grade don't be  
**[0:37:30-0:37:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:37:30):**  greedy because you know you start running water on a too steep of a grade it's going  
**[0:37:36-0:37:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:37:36):**  to start to erode different soil types particularly like granite soils with quite big quartz crystals  
**[0:37:43-0:37:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:37:43):**  is is quite is really abrasive country so you've got to be a bit careful about that  
**[0:37:48-0:37:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:37:48):**  even roads you know roads putting in roads you think you're doing the right thing putting  
**[0:37:53-0:37:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:37:53):**  in the road well you have to be careful about where you put the road in because ideally  
**[0:37:56-0:38:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:37:56):**  we're using those road water harvesters you know to direct water or you know harvest water  
**[0:38:01-0:38:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:38:01):**  to a dam or something like that but if we've got to go up a ridge or you know around the  
**[0:38:05-0:38:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:38:05):**  slope we just need to be conscious that that's going to pick up water and run and where does  
**[0:38:09-0:38:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:38:09):**  that water go is what you've got to think it's always a relationship of hardware to  
**[0:38:14-0:38:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:38:14):**  solve where as our mate Jeffrey Lawton would say who's kind of swale centric and hopefully  
**[0:38:21-0:38:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:38:21):**  he might hear me on that one but I'll stir him up because that's right anyway yeah so  
**[0:38:27-0:38:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:38:27):**  like you know you've got to have a bit of humor in life mate yeah like you know you've  
**[0:38:31-0:38:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:38:31):**  got a there's a there's a lot of water coming off roads and you've got to be you know can  
**[0:38:36-0:38:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:38:36):**  think about that where does that water go ideally we want to put it into some sort of  
**[0:38:40-0:38:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:38:40):**  storage because it's water coming off at speed as well that we have to think about for just  
**[0:38:47-0:38:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:38:47):**  you know if you understand earthworks respect the laser you know you respect your levels  
**[0:38:54-0:39:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:38:54):**  as long as you give it adequate freeboard and you've got a decent spillway then a lot  
**[0:39:01-0:39:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:39:01):**  of the time everything's okay you know I have seen swales in dispersive clay country and  
**[0:39:10-0:39:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:39:10):**  they've worked there's no tunnel erosion in that but I have seen tunnel erosion in with  
**[0:39:15-0:39:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:39:15):**  swales in diverse of players as well so you know but I wouldn't certainly advise to put  
**[0:39:20-0:39:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:39:20):**  swales in dispersive clay country but you know that's probably one of your big things  
**[0:39:26-0:39:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:39:26):**  to think about some sort of slip country you know rock strata you know have you got a big  
**[0:39:32-0:39:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:39:32):**  you know soil plume sitting on a big sheet of rock is it going if you're saturated this  
**[0:39:37-0:39:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:39:37):**  is going to slip is a thing to think about and you know that's why Darren Doherty or  
**[0:39:43-0:39:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:39:43):**  someone like that would advise a geotechnician to do work before any preliminary you know  
**[0:39:51-0:39:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:39:51):**  earthworks to understand the geology you know you should you should be doing soil tests  
**[0:39:56-0:40:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:39:56):**  look over time you know depending on the client you know sometimes I do soil tests sometimes  
**[0:40:02-0:40:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:40:02):**  I've done work for the client or they've had work done and you know I even looked down  
**[0:40:06-0:40:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:40:06):**  wombat holes out in the paddock to see the the soil profile you know any burrowing animal  
**[0:40:12-0:40:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:40:12):**  just look down there and go what's going on down there save you digging a hole yeah all  
**[0:40:16-0:40:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:40:16):**  right but you need to understand the soil type that you're working in definitely definitely  
**[0:40:23-0:40:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:40:23):**  now what are some of the steps that in your opinion anyone could take to sort of better  
**[0:40:28-0:40:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:40:28):**  manage water on their landscapes and that could include earthworks like you mentioned  
**[0:40:34-0:40:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:40:34):**  but it could include things that are more accessible to everybody yeah okay well like  
**[0:40:41-0:40:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:40:41):**  if you just think you know urban rural whichever but go to your property you know if that's  
**[0:40:49-0:40:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:40:49):**  a you know urban backyard if it's an urban backyard for example where does your water  
**[0:40:55-0:41:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:40:55):**  come off your roof you know where can you you know can you get access to wood chips  
**[0:41:00-0:41:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:41:00):**  you know what kind of biomass can you access because if you lay that out in a pattern that  
**[0:41:05-0:41:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:41:05):**  impounds water that holds up water that builds soil you lay a line of wood chips out on a  
**[0:41:11-0:41:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:41:11):**  contour pattern and and look at the deposition that it creates behind it over time so simple  
**[0:41:18-0:41:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:41:18):**  things like that is quite profound and really it's quite marvelous you know I was pulling  
**[0:41:27-0:41:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:41:27):**  something off my shed roof the other day and it there was the soil that was built from  
**[0:41:32-0:41:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:41:32):**  eucalyptus over 12 months underneath the the oil aluminium and the tin so you know it doesn't  
**[0:41:40-0:41:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:41:40):**  take much who's cleans their gutters out and realizes how much material is in the gutter  
**[0:41:45-0:41:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:41:45):**  since you put water on a passive form then it can drop everything it's carrying it can  
**[0:41:54-0:42:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:41:54):**  you know lay it out for you so it you know earthworks doesn't have to be this huge big  
**[0:42:00-0:42:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:42:00):**  job you know it's just probably a mindset or you know as braid lancaster would say plant  
**[0:42:06-0:42:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:42:06):**  the water you know and and again that can be get a get a few sticks and lay them down  
**[0:42:11-0:42:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:42:11):**  a specific pattern it plants the water watch what happens over time you know even a bare  
**[0:42:17-0:42:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:42:17):**  spot you know organics you know gather around and silk materials you know manures seeds  
**[0:42:26-0:42:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:42:26):**  well life comes on you know it is really quite profound how simple it is take your driveway  
**[0:42:32-0:42:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:42:32):**  and take the water because everyone's got a driveway take the water and shirt it off  
**[0:42:39-0:42:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:42:39):**  into the landscape plant it in little deposition pits again like use brad lancaster's work  
**[0:42:45-0:42:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:42:45):**  that's a simple thing that you can do because we're all got driveways you know obviously  
**[0:42:50-0:42:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:42:50):**  it's harder if we rent but you've got some space that you can work you know it's not  
**[0:42:58-0:43:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:42:58):**  hard and it's very rewarding work to to foster life because that's what we're doing and we're  
**[0:43:07-0:43:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:43:07):**  building a lifeboat and that's what we need to do pretty smartly and we're here in Australia  
**[0:43:13-0:43:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:43:13):**  you know we're desertifying quick smart and you know with the bushfires that we had last  
**[0:43:18-0:43:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:43:18):**  year you know it's pretty important that we plant the water in this landscape across the  
**[0:43:26-0:43:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:43:26):**  globe you know as we all know it's not a great a great situation but you know we know that  
**[0:43:32-0:43:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:43:32):**  we come back with positiveness too and that that it honestly is so simple you know lay  
**[0:43:38-0:43:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:43:38):**  a stick down on the edge of your driveway and watch materials gather behind it and there's  
**[0:43:45-0:43:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:43:45):**  some real lessons there it doesn't have to be complex it doesn't have to be big we can  
**[0:43:51-0:43:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:43:51):**  do it with lots of different ones no not at all and like you said those patterns that  
**[0:43:55-0:44:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:43:55):**  open up as you observe they play out in these sort of microcosms like you mentioned in urban  
**[0:44:00-0:44:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:44:00):**  or suburban plots and they play out in macrocosms like on larger landscapes and entire watersheds  
**[0:44:07-0:44:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:44:07):**  and you don't have to go and get you know 20 acres in a rural area or more to be able  
**[0:44:12-0:44:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:44:12):**  to play with these forms and really maximize in fact one of the things that I've certainly  
**[0:44:17-0:44:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:44:17):**  learned in my own design experience and working on projects like this is that the smaller  
**[0:44:23-0:44:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:44:23):**  the place is the more carefully you can curate and manage it and the intensity and the focus  
**[0:44:29-0:44:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:44:29):**  that you can put on a small space will give you so much more yields than a huge space  
**[0:44:33-0:44:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:44:33):**  that you can't really micromanage in the same way and there's a real advantage in that  
**[0:44:38-0:44:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:44:38):**  absolutely mate you're absolutely and you know my mind's too simple for the small space  
**[0:44:45-0:44:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:44:45):**  I have to take the broader landscape because it's easier because but it is all about patterns  
**[0:44:51-0:44:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:44:51):**  absolutely because that's all I do is I look at the landscape in a pattern form look at  
**[0:44:57-0:45:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:44:57):**  the water in a pattern form and then I apply a specific pattern to capture that energy  
**[0:45:05-0:45:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:45:05):**  or the surplus energy you know or you know an amount of that energy but that's all it's  
**[0:45:11-0:45:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:45:11):**  doing is applying a pattern and I don't mean that in any esoterical manner you know it's  
**[0:45:16-0:45:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:45:16):**  a very practical physical thing but observation it starts back to that yeah absolutely I cannot  
**[0:45:25-0:45:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:45:25):**  emphasize how important observation is you know different times of day you know what  
**[0:45:35-0:45:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:45:35):**  it always all comes back it does mate like different times of day you see landscape get  
**[0:45:41-0:45:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:45:41):**  up in the morning you know middle of the day is actually really hard to see land particularly  
**[0:45:45-0:45:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:45:45):**  in summer because if the vegetation is dried off it's quite glaring a full moon is you  
**[0:45:50-0:45:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:45:50):**  know or bright moon is really good to look at landscape because it's very soft and you  
**[0:45:55-0:46:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:45:55):**  can see shadow lines or you know early morning late afternoon is the time to look at landscape  
**[0:46:02-0:46:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:46:02):**  walk it feel it you know walk out there on a full moon and listen to the water feel the  
**[0:46:10-0:46:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:46:10):**  difference in temperature when you go from valley to ridge is there a nice thermal belt  
**[0:46:15-0:46:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:46:15):**  through that site because again that's observation yeah and that can change your you know influences  
**[0:46:22-0:46:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:46:22):**  and again that's the only interesting thing about adding water to the landscape is it's  
**[0:46:27-0:46:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:46:27):**  the the most effective you know thermal mass isn't it so we regulate temperature you know  
**[0:46:35-0:46:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:46:35):**  we moderate the temperature extremes of a site when we plant the water which is pretty  
**[0:46:41-0:46:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:46:41):**  cool where I'm from because I'm you know 300 kilometres inland so we're you know sort  
**[0:46:47-0:46:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:46:47):**  of a continental climate you know we get that climatic extreme of winter to summer so the  
**[0:46:54-0:47:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:46:54):**  more water I can plant here the more moderate my climate's going to become and I've already  
**[0:47:00-0:47:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:47:00):**  noticed the difference with trees of course but I have three water bodies on my half an  
**[0:47:07-0:47:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:47:07):**  acre here and it's changed how the cold air moves and where where I get frost settling  
**[0:47:14-0:47:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:47:14):**  yeah that's a very interesting but you know there's there's a real pleasure it's amazing  
**[0:47:22-0:47:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:47:22):**  how they all interact these different factors and I mean it's all connected right so as  
**[0:47:28-0:47:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:47:28):**  you start to work on one element it definitely affects others and as you sort of help the  
**[0:47:36-0:47:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:47:36):**  successional models along to mature they sort of all support each other just like you were  
**[0:47:41-0:47:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:47:41):**  saying in the beginning you take one step towards nature and it takes 10 steps you know  
**[0:47:45-0:47:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:47:45):**  towards you or yeah yeah and it's really inspiring it it's very encouraging I think too for people  
**[0:47:52-0:47:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:47:52):**  who are just beginning and who haven't studied this for a long time or haven't got a lot  
**[0:47:56-0:48:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:47:56):**  of experience it's like man even just the fact that you're considering these elements  
**[0:48:01-0:48:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:48:01):**  and that you're taking the time to understand a bit about pattern and and observe these  
**[0:48:06-0:48:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:48:06):**  formations and such you're already doing so much better than most people who are making  
**[0:48:10-0:48:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:48:10):**  huge decisions for landscapes and there's only really so much you can fail when you  
**[0:48:15-0:48:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:48:15):**  have those things in mind your failures are still going to be a certain level of progress  
**[0:48:20-0:48:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:48:20):**  absolutely mate absolutely it may be painful but we sometimes we need painful grass you  
**[0:48:26-0:48:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:48:26):**  know yeah look absolutely don't do this why I say start small make small mistakes  
**[0:48:34-0:48:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:48:34):**  you know that that's the the best way to do things you know build your confidence up develop  
**[0:48:40-0:48:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:48:40):**  your observational skills absolutely yeah but you know starting to understand it it's  
**[0:48:47-0:48:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:48:47):**  fantastic that the people have taken the step yeah yeah well look I think that's a good  
**[0:48:52-0:48:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:48:52):**  place for us to wrap up today I can tell that we could go on for much much longer and we  
**[0:48:57-0:49:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:48:57):**  see eye to eye on a lot of things here but it's been fantastic to finally connect with  
**[0:49:01-0:49:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:49:01):**  you I've been a fan of your work for a long time and I'm really glad too that you mentioned  
**[0:49:05-0:49:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:49:05):**  that project from Morocco I'll try and share the link to the pictures on your website so  
**[0:49:10-0:49:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:49:10):**  people can see what you were talking about I had a look at those myself okay cool please  
**[0:49:15-0:49:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:49:15):**  let me know for our listeners sake where they can find out more information get in touch  
**[0:49:20-0:49:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:49:20):**  with you see your courses and previous work that you've got online I've got a website

**[0:49:34-0:49:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:49:34):**  Doc Spice underscore permaculture you can follow my work I try to post something regularly  
**[0:49:41-0:49:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:49:41):**  when I'm out and about yeah you know give us a call if you're you know need some assistance  
**[0:49:48-0:49:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:49:48):**  or need some advice now I'm happy to help and aspire you know because we need people  
**[0:49:54-0:50:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:49:54):**  out there doing this even on that baby steps small scale is absolutely fine and it's a  
**[0:50:00-0:50:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:50:00):**  great way to start so please get to it folks go on we need you perfect well Doc thank you  
**[0:50:06-0:50:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/david-doc-spice-spicer/#t=0:50:06):**  so much for making time let's definitely catch up again sometime soon maybe we can explore

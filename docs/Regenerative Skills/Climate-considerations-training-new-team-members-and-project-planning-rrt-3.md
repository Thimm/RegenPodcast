**[0:01:37-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:01:37):**  last month, and I know you've got a topic that is dear to your heart that you want to  
**[0:01:42-0:01:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:01:42):**  start to explain to our listeners as well.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:01:45):**  Wait what?

**[0:01:48-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:01:48):**  That was the look of agreement.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:01:51):**  Yeah, we're shattered.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:01:54):**  We're working so much.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:01:57):**  It's insane how much is going on.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:02:01):**  So we're sitting here at the end of another long day of roofing, which FYI I find terrifying.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:02:07):**  Tell them why.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:02:09):**  Well, we covered that last week.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:02:11):**  I fell out of a tree a couple of months ago.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:02:15):**  So don't try that.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:02:18):**  It's not fun.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:02:19):**  But yeah, there is loads of stuff going on, and yeah, for the most part it's great fun.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:02:28):**  What was I going to talk about?  
**[0:02:29-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:02:29):**  Claim it.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:02:30):**  Well, tell us a little bit about what happened over the last month or so.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:02:34):**  What are the main projects that we've been working on and getting done?  
**[0:02:37-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:02:37):**  All right, well, I guess I should start where I finished in the last one and talk about  
**[0:02:42-0:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:02:42):**  the goats.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:02:44):**  We introduced, actually a little bit of what I want to talk about is developing a good  
**[0:02:50-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:02:50):**  strategy and a good timeline when you're developing your place.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:02:55):**  And that involves understanding the seasons, understanding the climate, just understanding  
**[0:03:00-0:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:03:00):**  those larger patterns.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:03:01):**  That's why you say we designed from patterns down to details.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:03:05):**  So we introduced a male goat when last Wednesday, about a week ago, yeah, I went down to my  
**[0:03:15-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:03:15):**  Colombian friend, N'yame's place.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:03:17):**  He has an awesome little permaculture spot and he keeps goats as well.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:03:20):**  And he's got a little tame macho that he says is an Embreira, which means like a male goat  
**[0:03:27-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:03:27):**  that tends to have daughters, which is exactly what we want.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:03:32):**  And he's a nice little fellow.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:03:33):**  I walked him here.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:03:34):**  He's got a two mile walk back.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:03:35):**  So that was pretty funny.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:03:36):**  Like this gringo walking along, pulling a goat behind him.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:03:43):**  And yeah, then I introduced him and I told a couple of people what I was doing and they  
**[0:03:47-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:03:47):**  said, oh, that lucky fellow, you know, he's gone to a Fiesta.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:03:52):**  But anyone who's seen this kind of thing before would know that it's not as much fun as it  
**[0:03:56-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:03:56):**  sounds for this macho to be introduced to these five females because they just started  
**[0:04:01-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:04:01):**  wailing on him straight away, like just beat him from one end of the cage to the next.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:04:07):**  Sorry, goat house to the next, not cage.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:04:12):**  By the way, anyone who thinks it's a cage, go look at the website.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:04:18):**  There's some photos of the go tell up.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:04:21):**  It's way nicer than where I live.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:04:22):**  It's beautiful.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:04:25):**  So yeah, they just wailed on him for a couple of days.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:04:29):**  And now it's transitioning from fighting into kind of co-living sort of thing.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:04:39):**  They're like roommates right now, but romance isn't blossoming yet.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:04:42):**  So I'm really egging in mine, you know.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:04:48):**  At least he's not sitting down in the house now.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:04:52):**  He just, the first, the only way he could stop beating him up was to sit down in the  
**[0:04:57-0:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:04:57):**  corner looking sorry for himself.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:04:59):**  At least he's standing up now and he's walking around the place and he's, you know, he's  
**[0:05:04-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:05:04):**  got a little dignity.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:05:06):**  You know, nobody's attracted to these sort of like characters that are just thrown in  
**[0:05:13-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:05:13):**  the corner feeling sorry for themselves.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:05:15):**  There's a whole, you know, there's a whole dating program on this.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:05:18):**  Guys who lack confidence just come and see our goat and do the opposite to everything  
**[0:05:23-0:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:05:23):**  he's doing.

**[0:05:25-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:05:25):**  You don't need to read any of those self-help books.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:05:29):**  Just watch goats.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:05:30):**  Remember last week where I said goats were the answer to every existential problem we've

**[0:05:39-0:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:05:39):**  Does someone else want to say something?  
**[0:05:41-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:05:41):**  Getting back to the, what's the strategy behind having, getting the young goat in there right  
**[0:05:47-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:05:47):**  now, the young male right now?  
**[0:05:49-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:05:49):**  Yeah, well, that's a good question.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:05:51):**  So yeah, it's about that bigger pattern of we live in the wet dry tropics here and we  
**[0:05:58-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:05:58):**  also live in a kind of a touristy area.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:06:00):**  So for the dry season here, it's winter in the north.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:06:04):**  So a lot of people come down here to get away, enjoy the beautiful climate because dry season  
**[0:06:09-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:06:09):**  is actually when the temperatures are lower.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:06:12):**  So it's sunny all day and kind of cool at night.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:06:14):**  Very pleasant.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:06:16):**  Not many problems with insects or anything like that that you might normally associate  
**[0:06:20-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:06:20):**  with the tropics.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:06:21):**  And then the rains come, all the tourists come home, but also the land flushes up.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:06:27):**  It just goes green.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:06:28):**  The roads and the ditches all just fill up with what, you know, weeds basically, but  
**[0:06:33-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:06:33):**  what I call goat food.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:06:37):**  So you know, it's a great time actually to have the goats pregnant because they stopped  
**[0:06:42-0:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:06:42):**  giving milk.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:06:43):**  They put their energy into growing their baby, not producing milk.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:06:47):**  So it's a good time to dry them up because there's no lactose to sell and there's loads  
**[0:06:51-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:06:51):**  of food for them to, you know, eat for two.  
**[0:06:55-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:06:55):**  So that's like, you know, that's one example of designing from patterns down to details.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:07:01):**  The detail is knowing that you need to get the goats pregnant at a certain time of year.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:07:05):**  You need to have them dry up.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:07:07):**  And the pattern is the fact that we have these climactic and market conditions to deal with.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:07:14):**  So we design accordingly, you know?  
**[0:07:17-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:07:17):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:07:18):**  I mean, planning and prepping within the limitations of a climate is essential, not just for goats  
**[0:07:25-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:07:25):**  or for gardens, but in our case as we've been living quite severely through the build process.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:07:33):**  So we've got the house going up right now, which has quite a few stages of like a push  
**[0:07:39-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:07:39):**  to get certain things done.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:07:41):**  At first, of course, is the foundation.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:07:43):**  We can't do anything without that.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:07:45):**  Nothing goes up until the foundation is ready.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:07:47):**  Our foundations are actually quite minimal.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:07:49):**  We're doing Japanese style pinstone foundations that are anchoring in the main support posts  
**[0:07:55-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:07:55):**  for the roof.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:07:57):**  And given that we're approaching the rainy season pretty fast here, I chose to put all  
**[0:08:02-0:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:08:02):**  the efforts into getting the roofs up so that we can keep the build site dry down below.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:08:09):**  Because the rainy season here is quite severe.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:08:13):**  We do still get mostly sunny, dry, sunny mornings.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:08:17):**  And the storms kind of roll in in the afternoon.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:08:22):**  And it's fairly predictable.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:08:26):**  But then sometimes you also get a stretch where it's just rainy all the time.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:08:30):**  So if you don't have a covered, dry, clean work site, it's really going to slow down  
**[0:08:34-0:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:08:34):**  progress.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:08:36):**  So for that reason, we prioritize getting those roofs up.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:08:38):**  And given that this is Guatemala, that still ended up taking way longer than we thought.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:08:44):**  First of all, deliveries were slowed down and then some of them arrived.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:08:50):**  And the things that we had ordered were not correct.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:08:53):**  We had to send a few things back.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:08:56):**  And you know, with the lack of infrastructure and consistency and quality control here,  
**[0:09:00-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:09:00):**  there are a lot of challenges for staying on on schedule and on budget.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:09:07):**  But that being said, we had quite a bit of rain before the bamboo has been covered now  
**[0:09:13-0:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:09:13):**  with acoustic insulation.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:09:15):**  And tomorrow, the corrugated steel for the roofs is going up after that.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:09:22):**  So finally, it looks like we're going to beat the rainy season.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:09:24):**  But we did get a little bit of water damage on our uncovered bamboo.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:09:27):**  And since it's treated with chemicals, not terribly toxic or anything, it's just boractic  
**[0:09:32-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:09:32):**  acid, which extends the life of bamboo and makes sure that fungus and insects don't proliferate  
**[0:09:38-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:09:38):**  too much inside of them.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:09:40):**  That starts to get washed away really fast if the bamboo is not protected.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:09:45):**  So I was stressed out there for a little bit while it was raining on top of our bamboo.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:09:49):**  We were all stressed out there while that was happening.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:09:52):**  Just in case anyone was wondering.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:09:53):**  Yeah, it does include all of us for sure.  
**[0:09:56-0:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:09:56):**  But seeing as that's the main project that I'm in charge of, and I thought that it'd  
**[0:09:59-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:09:59):**  be ready before the rains came.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:10:01):**  They came a little bit early.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:10:03):**  Material orders came in a little bit late.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:10:05):**  There are certain...  
**[0:10:06-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:10:06):**  Which is another broad pattern that actually should be included into designs in this part  
**[0:10:11-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:10:11):**  of the world.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:10:12):**  Yeah, in any developing country.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:10:14):**  I mean, I've primarily worked in developing countries, especially when doing natural building  
**[0:10:18-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:10:18):**  projects.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:10:19):**  So I did expect it a little bit, but it was kind of a little perfect storm of materials  
**[0:10:23-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:10:23):**  getting late, rain coming early.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:10:26):**  And fortunately, we've got nice sunny weather.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:10:28):**  We'll have the corrugated metal up tomorrow, so it's not a big deal.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:10:34):**  But yeah, we definitely need to put in an extra little treatment on the bamboo to make  
**[0:10:37-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:10:37):**  sure that it doesn't start degrading any faster.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:10:41):**  So you're talking about climate really here.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:10:44):**  We talked about the scale of permanence last week, and this was kind of like one of the

**[0:10:49-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:10:49):**  This idea that the scale of permanence starts there with climate for a reason, right?  
**[0:10:53-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:10:53):**  It's the most important thing.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:10:56):**  And I think it's a thing that gets overlooked, honestly, a lot, I feel, in people doing permaculture  
**[0:11:02-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:11:02):**  designs because really the techniques are only as...

**[0:16:32-0:16:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:16:32):**  It's realizing that, yeah, mid-succession agroforestry with plenty of light entering

**[0:16:49-0:16:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:16:49):**  So here again it's an interesting climate.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:16:51):**  We get a lot of sun here, so for dry season we can grow vegetables really well here, which  
**[0:16:56-0:17:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:16:56):**  is also can be tricky so close to the equator because the days aren't that long.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:17:02):**  So things like your tubers and your nightshades that just do great in greenhouses in the north  
**[0:17:11-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:17:11):**  because they get hours and hours of sun, that's not the case here.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:17:13):**  But we have a lovely garden that gets the morning sun and gets sun all day.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:17:19):**  So we can grow a lot of stuff in it, especially as it's right next to our animal house so  
**[0:17:23-0:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:17:23):**  we have fertility right on hand.

**[0:17:34-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:17:34):**  You plant those kinds of nitrogen fixing trees along the edge of the part that you cultivate.

**[0:20:11-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:20:11):**  shade but also produce loads of biomass and respond to the harvest of it.

**[0:20:27-0:20:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:20:27):**  nitrogen down into the ground and they also produce loads of biomass.

**[0:20:45-0:20:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:20:45):**  need to replenish it because that's the thing about here.

**[0:20:56-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:20:56):**  organic material that's going to just burn away and if you don't have wind breaks and

**[0:21:07-0:21:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:21:07):**  Even if you've got a terrace, it doesn't matter.

**[0:21:13-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:21:13):**  I say right now the desert is going the wrong way.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:21:17):**  Too many people are employing strategies that don't take any of these factors into account

**[0:21:29-0:21:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:21:29):**  certain parts of Guatemala where like El Corridor Seco, the dry corridor is encroaching into

**[0:23:55-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:23:55):**  the different beds of things that will, basically the functions are they need to cover the soil.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:24:02):**  So things like sweet potato, New Zealand spinach, squash do a great job.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:24:08):**  Squash especially just like covers out the ground.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:24:12):**  We want some of them to produce, we want all of them to produce biomass.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:24:16):**  We want things to fix nitrogen and we want like good hardy root crops.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:24:21):**  So we want to be able to kind of put a system in place that just looks after itself and  
**[0:24:26-0:24:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:24:26):**  that we can then dig up at the end of the year, harvest from it and then let our chickens,  
**[0:24:31-0:24:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:24:31):**  because we deliberately put the chicken house next, well we're building the chicken house  
**[0:24:36-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:24:36):**  now, you know we can let them attack that and they'll just clean up all that biomass  
**[0:24:41-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:24:41):**  for us and then we recrop it and plant our vegetables.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:24:45):**  So you know, understand, fitting that pattern again into the, or fitting those design parameters  
**[0:24:51-0:24:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:24:51):**  into the climactic pattern is important I think, you know.  
**[0:24:56-0:24:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:24:56):**  Yeah absolutely, there's so many different applications for this and like you said we're  
**[0:24:59-0:25:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:24:59):**  really figuring this out from our own experience and what we know, but the new application

**[0:25:09-0:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:25:09):**  commonality that we have, the three of us, me as a builder, the two of you working more

**[0:25:20-0:25:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:25:20):**  ground and as kind of a trial place to see what works and what is worth spreading and  
**[0:25:27-0:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:25:27):**  promoting in these climates specifically.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:25:32):**  Now I know a big thing that we've been doing in this last month is starting to train new  
**[0:25:36-0:25:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:25:36):**  people.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:25:38):**  So Neil can you tell us a little bit about the wonderful little additions to our team  
**[0:25:43-0:25:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:25:43):**  and how that's been going?  
**[0:25:46-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:25:46):**  Yeah it's awesome.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:25:47):**  I never could have imagined something like this really happening.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:25:52):**  Jaira is the thing that he always says that I really have come to take on which is that  
**[0:25:56-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:25:56):**  like community is an emergent property of a healthy or unhealthy ecosystem.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:26:01):**  So you know, an unhealthy ecosystem is likely to produce an unhealthy community in my view.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:26:07):**  But we're doing everything we can to improve the little ecosystem we're living in here  
**[0:26:12-0:26:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:26:12):**  and we took on about six months ago for one of  
**[0:26:22-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:26:22):**  the courses that we do at Atitlan Organics.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:26:25):**  We give scholarships on every one of those courses and one of the kids who took the scholarship  
**[0:26:29-0:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:26:29):**  he really loved it.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:26:30):**  He's the son of Shad's farm manager from Atitlan Organics and he's only 13.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:26:38):**  But he's basically Luke Skywalker.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:26:41):**  He's kind of like Luke Skywalker yeah.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:26:43):**  He's like training to be a Jedi.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:26:45):**  He went back to his parents and he said I don't want to go to school anymore.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:26:47):**  Yeah but the problem is he's learning from Darth Vader.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:26:49):**  He's supposed to learn from someone from the light side there Neil.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:26:52):**  Well look right now he could you know he's turning into a powerful individual.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:26:58):**  This kid went back to his folks and said I don't want to go to school anymore.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:27:01):**  I don't think it takes too long.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:27:02):**  I'm bored in class and I don't think I'll get a good job after I finish.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:27:07):**  And his parents.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:27:08):**  And this too we're talking about the education system here in Guatemala.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:27:11):**  Quite different from the public education you might get in the west or a more developed  
**[0:27:15-0:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:27:15):**  country.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:27:16):**  So yeah this kid this kid is way smarter than all of his teachers.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:27:20):**  That's one of that was definitely one of his problems.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:27:24):**  And one of it and he's also way smarter than us.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:27:29):**  So at that age I wasn't nearly as cool as him when I was 13.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:27:32):**  Oh my God this kid is just he's a rock star.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:27:35):**  So he's been with us now for about two months.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:27:39):**  He's able to milk the goats and manage them fully.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:27:42):**  He was a brilliant like a you then they are helper to the to the bamboo Sarah the professional  
**[0:27:48-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:27:48):**  bamboo workers we had in here helping us learn how to do all the cuts.  
**[0:27:54-0:27:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:27:54):**  He's learned he's becoming really proficient at carpentry.  
**[0:27:56-0:27:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:27:56):**  No he really helped me to make.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:27:58):**  He really helped me a lot making the goat house and he's been making stone walls and  
**[0:28:02-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:28:02):**  landscaping a lot with Jair learning how to plant crops.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:28:06):**  He's taught me some stuff his father you know has taken him planting his corn with him so  
**[0:28:11-0:28:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:28:11):**  he knew stuff coming in already and he's just got this awesome work attitude.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:28:17):**  And you know we're paying him kind of like an intern wage.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:28:22):**  He's super happy with it because he's got you know he's got pocket money and I keep  
**[0:28:26-0:28:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:28:26):**  saying to him leave go rest.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:28:29):**  You know you don't need to be here all time but he won't leave when there's stuff going  
**[0:28:32-0:28:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:28:32):**  on and he's been so loyal that you know we decided to start giving English classes and  
**[0:28:41-0:28:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:28:41):**  also because another great little family came and started helping us with the goats.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:28:47):**  A single mom and her her two daughters they came and they kept asking us if they could  
**[0:28:53-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:28:53):**  walk the goats and so eventually I was like yeah I don't have time to walk the goats right  
**[0:28:59-0:29:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:28:59):**  now none of us do.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:29:00):**  So they come and take the goats for a walk and we started off you know paying them for  
**[0:29:05-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:29:05):**  their time we still do but they really liked the garden and the girls wanted to like usually  
**[0:29:10-0:29:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:29:10):**  wanted to stay and hang around and play in the garden after they finished.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:29:14):**  So we started saying to them you know like you know do a little bit of weeding and take  
**[0:29:19-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:29:19):**  a bag of greens or whatever's in the garden so they've been doing that.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:29:23):**  They love the yogurt they're like they're insane.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:29:27):**  They just like gulp it down every time I give them a liter of yogurt.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:29:32):**  So we give them yogurt and milk and you know there was just such a nice scene developing  
**[0:29:38-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:29:38):**  in the place that we decided to start giving English classes.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:29:42):**  So Marie our neighbour who also helps us in the in the kitchen we started we started doing  
**[0:29:48-0:29:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:29:48):**  English classes for the three of them and they've been really lucky and so it's like  
**[0:29:53-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:29:53):**  two Marie as one of them is 25 and one of them is 10.

**[0:38:57-0:39:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:38:57):**  about the parameters that we're working with with the climate and basically the timeline  
**[0:39:02-0:39:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:39:02):**  that's constantly encroaching on us as this climate goes through its different processes  
**[0:39:05-0:39:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:39:05):**  we've got to keep up with it we've got to stay ahead of it a little and you came up  
**[0:39:09-0:39:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:39:09):**  Neil with a great sort of plan of almost the next full year both development as a business  
**[0:39:15-0:39:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:39:15):**  development of our site and the ecology talk a little bit about where we're headed well  
**[0:39:23-0:39:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:39:23):**  we'll see if it was a great plan yeah we will we're not all in agreement about this plan  
**[0:39:28-0:39:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:39:28):**  but it's a great outline to start with and actually that's really important because when  
**[0:39:32-0:39:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:39:32):**  you're dealing with living systems there's always going to be some variables and some  
**[0:39:36-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:39:36):**  things that you didn't consider in your in your plan so causing it to be too rigid is  
**[0:39:41-0:39:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:39:41):**  going to be much more of a hindrance in the long run you've got to leave kind of a lot  
**[0:39:47-0:39:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:39:47):**  of the specifics to to observation and that's really the only way to interact in a healthy  
**[0:39:53-0:39:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:39:53):**  way with living systems right yeah observe observe and interact and be fluid and don't  
**[0:39:57-0:40:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:39:57):**  don't get too attached to your ideas I think that's kind of what that principle you mentioned  
**[0:40:03-0:40:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:40:03):**  observe and interact obviously but also like accept feedback that's sort of another way  
**[0:40:08-0:40:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:40:08):**  of saying like don't be too attached to your to your plan you know or to anything really  
**[0:40:13-0:40:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:40:13):**  I think if I understood any of those books on spirituality I read not being attached  
**[0:40:19-0:40:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:40:19):**  is is important important the most is a recurring theme yeah it was one of the main things I  
**[0:40:25-0:40:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:40:25):**  took from it that and be in the moment and what else don't eat pig chanting and flowy  
**[0:40:32-0:40:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:40:32):**  pants no no no I'm joking I think dreadlocks are prerequisite for a lot of enlightenment  
**[0:40:39-0:40:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:40:39):**  no no no no let's not get personal no I actually love that stuff I'm joking okay so what I  
**[0:40:47-0:40:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:40:47):**  what I was talking about was yeah looking at kind of where we're at what we want to  
**[0:40:52-0:40:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:40:52):**  do on the land I don't want to bore people too much with this but I'll just like kind  
**[0:40:55-0:40:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:40:55):**  of go through it in general you know we got goats in everyone's heard me talk about the  
**[0:40:58-0:41:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:40:58):**  goats so in May by the way I put this on a spreadsheet you know because if you want someone  
**[0:41:04-0:41:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:41:04):**  to take you seriously you have to you have to put things in a spreadsheet otherwise I'm  
**[0:41:07-0:41:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:41:07):**  so glad you're learning this you know otherwise no one will even normally even read your plan  
**[0:41:12-0:41:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:41:12):**  unless it's on a spreadsheet nowadays so put it on a spreadsheet lesson part one you know  
**[0:41:18-0:41:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:41:18):**  then I'm saying like you got to get a macho in so we got our male goat in last week and  
**[0:41:23-0:41:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:41:23):**  I'm gonna leave him there I think it'll take the little fella about that good two months  
**[0:41:27-0:41:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:41:27):**  to get that job done six weeks he's got to work on five girls men it's a big job yeah  
**[0:41:33-0:41:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:41:33):**  well he's got it kind of it's interesting the way it happens they sort of simultaneously  
**[0:41:37-0:41:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:41:37):**  will all express interest so it I feel like that's kind of that's sort of how it usually  
**[0:41:44-0:41:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:41:44):**  is you know the way people say you know it's all either a feast or a famine or you hear  
**[0:41:48-0:41:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:41:48):**  these single guys complain about like how they you know they can't get any action for  
**[0:41:52-0:41:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:41:52):**  months and months and then all of a sudden there's like three different girls interested  
**[0:41:56-0:42:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:41:56):**  in they don't know what to do in this case five and right now none of them are interested  
**[0:42:02-0:42:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:42:02):**  in him but we're hoping that's going to change I think it is he's starting to stand up for  
**[0:42:08-0:42:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:42:08):**  himself a little bit and then yeah he'll hopefully do his job and we can give him back to N'yame  
**[0:42:14-0:42:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:42:14):**  around June and in June I want to get chickens so I want to put the chicken house below the

**[0:42:33-0:42:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:42:33):**  I so that they'll be laying eggs by by the start of the high season you know by the end  
**[0:42:38-0:42:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:42:38):**  of October so we'll just feed them and raise them for now and have them make compost and  
**[0:42:43-0:42:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:42:43):**  we'll empty the goat house into the chicken house they'll pick all the worms out of it  
**[0:42:47-0:42:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:42:47):**  and scratch it up and make it aerobic and add their own manure with throw loads of like  
**[0:42:52-0:42:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:42:52):**  chopped vegetation under them and dry and straw then what else do we have down here  
**[0:42:58-0:43:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:42:58):**  we'll we'll get going on our living fencing because the problem we have no is we have  
**[0:43:05-0:43:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:43:05):**  all these plans to do earthworks on the rest of our property and put in our perennial food  
**[0:43:10-0:43:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:43:10):**  forest systems which we will also link up to our animal systems so that they'll be able  
**[0:43:14-0:43:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:43:14):**  to arrange in them but we don't want to start doing earthworks now because the rains are  
**[0:43:20-0:43:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:43:20):**  about to come so they won't hold and we don't really want to take vegetation out either  
**[0:43:26-0:43:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:43:26):**  so we would inevitably doing that have to rip up a bunch of the coffee and cushion that's  
**[0:43:30-0:43:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:43:30):**  on the land no we don't want to do that so we're going to leave that but what we are

**[0:43:40-0:43:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:43:40):**  it's a tricky one because if we look at how the scale permanence works and well logic  
**[0:43:47-0:43:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:43:47):**  in general and experience like it's important to put in permanent vegetation but you gotta  
**[0:43:53-0:43:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:43:53):**  like make sure it's it's where it's going to be permanent so like if we're going to  
**[0:43:59-0:44:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:43:59):**  come in and start digging up areas it's it's kind of a waste of time to put some some of

**[0:44:09-0:44:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:44:09):**  so the simple solution to that is to focus on the details where can we put perennial  
**[0:44:15-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-climate-considerations-training-new-team-members-and-project-planning-regenerative-round-table-3/#t=0:44:15):**  vegetation in where we're not going to worry about it for a while and running the north

**[0:02:27-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:02:27):**  My guest today, Rhonda Sherman, is the director of the Compost Learning Lab at North Carolina  
**[0:02:32-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:02:32):**  State University and a leading expert on vermicomposting.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:02:36):**  Rhonda travels extensively to present workshops and to consult with farmers, businesses, and  
**[0:02:41-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:02:41):**  institutions on the development and management of vermicomposting systems.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:02:45):**  She also organizes the annual North Carolina State Vermiculture Conference, which for 19  
**[0:02:51-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:02:51):**  years has drawn participants from across the United States and around the globe.  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:02:55):**  She is a co-editor of Vermiculture Technology and has written extensively about composting  
**[0:02:59-0:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:02:59):**  and vermicomposting in her role with North Carolina State University.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:03:04):**  Now in this episode, I talked with Rhonda about her new book, The Worm Farmer's Handbook.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:03:08):**  Though the book focuses mostly on mid to large-scale vermicomposting systems, we start by talking  
**[0:03:13-0:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:03:13):**  about small residential vermicomposting systems and the positive effect it can have on our  
**[0:03:18-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:03:18):**  lives by taking back control of our waste streams and turning it into an incredible  
**[0:03:22-0:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:03:22):**  product.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:03:24):**  We also go into detail about troubleshooting problems in the system, feeding and watering  
**[0:03:28-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:03:28):**  indicators, pest deterrents, and much more.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:03:31):**  Rhonda also shares some great resources from her website that you can use for free and  
**[0:03:36-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:03:36):**  which I've linked to in the show notes for the episode at AbundantEdge.com.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:03:40):**  Now before I ramble on too much, I'll turn things over to Rhonda.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:03:43):**  Hey Rhonda, thank you so much for taking the time to be with us here today.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:03:47):**  How are you doing?  
**[0:03:48-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:03:48):**  Great!  
**[0:03:49-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:03:49):**  It's wonderful to be here.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:03:51):**  Look, I've got a ton of questions about vermicomposting that I would love to ask, but before we jump  
**[0:03:57-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:03:57):**  into all of those, would you tell us a little bit about what got you interested specifically  
**[0:04:01-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:04:01):**  in worms, breeding them, as well as making compost?  
**[0:04:05-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:04:05):**  Okay, well, so the university, North Carolina State University, hired me in 1993 because  
**[0:04:16-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:04:16):**  the state had just passed recycling regulations and everyone was calling this land-grant university  
**[0:04:23-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:04:23):**  to ask, how do we recycle?  
**[0:04:26-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:04:26):**  And so I was hired to answer their questions and help guide them.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:04:31):**  But what I noticed is that people were ignoring food waste.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:04:35):**  It was all about cans, paper, and bottles.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:04:38):**  So I started writing about food waste and I put together a little publication called  
**[0:04:44-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:04:44):**  Worms Can Recycle Your Garbage, about how to do household vermicomposting, and it just  
**[0:04:52-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:04:52):**  went viral.  
**[0:04:53-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:04:53):**  I mean, it just had to keep being reprinted and inquiries started flowing in from all  
**[0:05:00-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:05:00):**  over the world.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:05:01):**  So it really changed the course of my career because now people in 111 countries have contacted  
**[0:05:09-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:05:09):**  me personally to say, hey, I really want to learn how to do vermicomposting.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:05:15):**  That is fascinating.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:05:16):**  And I love that this kind of struck a chord and resonated with so many people around the  
**[0:05:20-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:05:20):**  world.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:05:21):**  To back up a little bit and before we get into sort of the how and the why of vermicomposting,  
**[0:05:27-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:05:27):**  go ahead and talk a little bit about the food scraps and biodegradable waste problem that  
**[0:05:33-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:05:33):**  we have in the world.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:05:34):**  Well, it's a huge problem and it causes problems that most people are unaware of.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:05:42):**  Most people don't realize the terrible effects that food waste has on landfills.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:05:50):**  Most of the public really doesn't think about landfills and they're not educated about it.  
**[0:05:55-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:05:55):**  They're not provided that education in school.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:05:58):**  And so what they don't realize is that when food waste goes into the landfill, it creates  
**[0:06:06-0:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:06:06):**  methane and methane, as we know, is one of the most powerful components leading to climate  
**[0:06:14-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:06:14):**  change.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:06:15):**  And so all this methane gets created by food waste and so it's like the number three cause  
**[0:06:23-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:06:23):**  of landfills or the third human cause of methane in the world.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:06:28):**  And so it's not just air emissions, but it's also what eventually leaks out of landfills  
**[0:06:35-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:06:35):**  and food waste makes what leaks out to be more toxic because the acidic food waste can  
**[0:06:44-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:06:44):**  release heavy metals that are from just cans that are in the landfill.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:06:51):**  So lots and lots of environmental problems and we haven't even touched on how many people  
**[0:06:56-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:06:56):**  wash food waste on their sinks, you know, and that causes a real big problem too with  
**[0:07:03-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:07:03):**  killing aquatic life and it messes up the wastewater treatment plants that really weren't  
**[0:07:10-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:07:10):**  designed to deal with all that food waste.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:07:13):**  And so how can the cultivation of worms help to deal with this waste issue?  
**[0:07:17-0:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:07:17):**  Well, we simply have to stop throwing away food waste.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:07:22):**  We have to stop putting it into landfills and stop putting it down the drain.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:07:27):**  And it's very simple.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:07:28):**  It's a simple thing to do that people at home can do.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:07:33):**  It's really a huge act.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:07:35):**  I think sometimes people feel like, you know, oh, you know, I can't make much of an impact  
**[0:07:40-0:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:07:40):**  on the world, but you can.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:07:43):**  And so just having a worm bin, a compost bin in your backyard, those to process your food  
**[0:07:50-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:07:50):**  waste on site, you know, in your apartment, in your home, instead of relying on the city  
**[0:07:58-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:07:58):**  to drive around in huge trucks with paying for labor, paying for gas and fuel and maintenance  
**[0:08:05-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:08:05):**  and all the air emissions, you know, it's just a huge carbon footprint for your community  
**[0:08:12-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:08:12):**  to come and pick up your food waste.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:08:15):**  And it's so simple for you to take care of your food waste yourself and turn it into  
**[0:08:20-0:08:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:08:20):**  this really valuable soil amendment that will have a really powerful effect on your plants.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:08:29):**  Creating a worm composting bin is something that's accessible to just about anyone.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:08:34):**  Let's see if we can address kind of how you can get that to work in a small residential  
**[0:08:39-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:08:39):**  context.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:08:40):**  And then let's talk about some of the ways that you can scale it up if you want to start  
**[0:08:43-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:08:43):**  making it for commercial context.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:08:45):**  Okay.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:08:46):**  So, I mean, you don't have to have a bin, but if you're going to have it inside your  
**[0:08:53-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:08:53):**  home or right outside, it is nice to have a bin.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:08:58):**  You can make it yourself out of wood, but you can also just buy a plastic storage bin.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:09:08):**  They cost about $5, and you can just strategically drill holes just around the top inch of the  
**[0:09:20-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:09:20):**  sides of the bin, never the lid.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:09:24):**  So you only want the holes on the sides at the very upper edges and then some holes on  
**[0:09:30-0:09:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:09:30):**  the bottom of the bin, and you're ready to go.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:09:33):**  So anybody could do it.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:09:35):**  You know, I mean, money should not be an issue.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:09:39):**  You don't need to invest a lot of money to get started with Burma composting.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:09:43):**  What's going to cost the most is to buy worms from a worm grower.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:09:49):**  And so what's the significance of putting those holes strategically along the side and  
**[0:09:52-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:09:52):**  not the top?  
**[0:09:53-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:09:53):**  Well, if you put them in the lid, then moisture can escape.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:10:00):**  It will evaporate through the lid.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:10:02):**  Also, if you had the bin outside, then maybe rain would get into it.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:10:10):**  And so it's just a really bad idea to have holes in the lid of the worm bin.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:10:15):**  And all that's necessary is just to have some tiny holes around the upper sides of the bin.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:10:22):**  You don't need them all over the place.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:10:24):**  The bedding of the bin needs to be 80% moisture, which is quite a bit.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:10:32):**  And so if you have a bunch of holes all over the place, then too much moisture will leak  
**[0:10:38-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:10:38):**  out of the bin.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:10:40):**  And so is this like a double bottom configuration?  
**[0:10:42-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:10:42):**  Because this is something that I had built for myself back when I lived in the States,  
**[0:10:47-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:10:47):**  and we kind of used this secondary catchment to get the liquid, the castings.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:10:53):**  Well, liquid and castings are two different things.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:10:58):**  Castings are what the worm excretes.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:11:02):**  So it's the worm manure.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:11:03):**  And that will always end up on the bottom of the bin.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:11:06):**  If you do things correctly, you will not have excess liquid.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:11:11):**  You won't have that liquid coming out of your bin.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:11:14):**  So is that an indication that it's over-hydrated, or the moisture is out of balance?  
**[0:11:18-0:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:11:18):**  Yes.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:11:19):**  And so how do you make sure that you maintain the right moisture balance?  
**[0:11:23-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:11:23):**  What are some indicators you can look for?  
**[0:11:25-0:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:11:25):**  Well, the biggest thing is to not overfeed.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:11:30):**  So a worm bin, I want to tell you the difference between vermicompost and compost.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:11:36):**  If you were going to sell compost, like a cubic yard of compost, you would sell it for  
**[0:11:43-0:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:11:43):**  about $30 to $35.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:11:46):**  If you were to sell a cubic yard of vermicompost, you would sell it for a minimum of $200.  
**[0:11:52-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:11:52):**  $200 to $800 for a cubic yard of vermicompost.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:12:00):**  That's incredible.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:12:01):**  And where is all that extra value coming from?  
**[0:12:03-0:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:12:03):**  So that's a huge difference.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:12:06):**  And so, for example, when I have, for my worm bin at home, I keep that in mind.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:12:12):**  I keep in mind that the vermicompost is much more valuable than the compost.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:12:18):**  And so I'm there, and plus, my worm bin is much smaller than my compost bin.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:12:27):**  And so I just treat my worm bin with kind of more respect.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:12:32):**  And so I just don't overfeed.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:12:35):**  I put in some food waste, I wait until the worms have eaten it, and then I add more.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:12:42):**  And whereas with the compost bin, you can put a lot of food waste in there.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:12:47):**  And of course, you need to have a lot of carbonaceous material.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:12:51):**  You have to have at least three times as much carbon, like leaves that you would put into  
**[0:12:58-0:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:12:58):**  the compost bin.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:13:01):**  But the compost bin is more forgiving than the worm bin.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:13:05):**  So I think it's really important to have both.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:13:08):**  Because if you produce a lot of food waste, then instead of putting it all in the worm  
**[0:13:15-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:13:15):**  bin, you can put the excess in your compost bin.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:13:20):**  And so what are some of the visual cues that you can tell if the worms have made it through  
**[0:13:25-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:13:25):**  the food that you've given them already, and it's all right to continue to add more?  
**[0:13:29-0:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:13:29):**  The food would disappear.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:13:30):**  Does it just turn into what looks like sort of black hummus material?  
**[0:13:35-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:13:35):**  Or are there still some unbroken bits of material that would still allow you to continue feeding?  
**[0:13:42-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:13:42):**  Well, I mean, when you put in, say, your kitchen waste, it's just going to disappear.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:13:49):**  It's going to be gone.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:13:51):**  And where you put it, it will disappear.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:13:56):**  And then you'll notice that the castings always go to the bottom of the bin.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:14:00):**  So that's the black hummus soil-looking material.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:14:03):**  But that would be on the bottom.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:14:06):**  Now when I made my own sort of small home-scale composting bin, they recommended that we put  
**[0:14:12-0:14:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:14:12):**  a whole bunch of carbon material down at the bottom, even things like old papers sort of  
**[0:14:19-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:14:19):**  cut up into strips.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:14:21):**  What is your, I guess, first steps in creating bedding and an environment inside the bin  
**[0:14:29-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:14:29):**  that's going to be the healthiest and most conducive for reproduction of the worms?  
**[0:14:34-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:14:34):**  OK, so say you've decided to spend $5 on a plastic storage bin with a lid.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:14:44):**  And you've drilled your holes, your small holes, into the bin.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:14:49):**  And then you can take newspaper or office paper and just tear it into thin strips.  
**[0:14:55-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:14:55):**  And then you soak it in a bucket of water.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:14:59):**  So it can be fun.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:15:02):**  If you have children, grandchildren, they can tear up the strips of paper and then soak  
**[0:15:08-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:15:08):**  it for 10 minutes so that the water gets absorbed into all of the paper fibers.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:15:15):**  And then you gently wring out the water.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:15:17):**  So you just squeeze to get excess water out.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:15:21):**  And then you kind of pull the paper apart, kind of fluff it up as you put it into the  
**[0:15:27-0:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:15:27):**  bin.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:15:28):**  And you would fill the bin halfway full with that paper.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:15:33):**  And then you can add your worms, which you've purchased from a worm grower.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:15:37):**  You need to get Isonia fetida, earthworms.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:15:43):**  One of their common names is red wiggler.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:15:45):**  But anyhow, you'll get that in a bag or a box.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:15:48):**  And you simply gently empty out that bag onto the top of the bedding and just step back.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:15:58):**  The worms will move into the bedding.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:16:01):**  So don't try to help them because you could accidentally hurt them because they have very  
**[0:16:06-0:16:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:16:06):**  fragile skin.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:16:08):**  But they'll go down into the bedding.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:16:11):**  Now once they get established in that bedding, I know you mentioned that food scraps are  
**[0:16:15-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:16:15):**  probably the best things to feed them.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:16:17):**  Are there any things in food scraps or common household items that you want to make sure  
**[0:16:21-0:16:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:16:21):**  stay out of that vermicomposting bin for the health of the worms?  
**[0:16:26-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:16:26):**  Yes, okay, in a small household system, you definitely don't want to put meat, fish, grease,  
**[0:16:38-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:16:38):**  bones, dairy products.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:16:40):**  Okay, so you keep that out.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:16:43):**  You keep out dog and cat manure.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:16:47):**  You keep out citrus.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:16:50):**  So you don't want to put anything citrus into a small bin like that because it can really  
**[0:16:57-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:16:57):**  throw off the pH and make it too acidic.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:17:04):**  But you'll notice with a small bin like that that worms kind of beeline for certain foods  
**[0:17:09-0:17:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:17:09):**  and will avoid other foods.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:17:12):**  So people have said onions and garlic, they tend to avoid that.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:17:19):**  But I wouldn't put anything with sugar, a strong sugary thing because that could attract  
**[0:17:30-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:17:30):**  ants.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:17:31):**  So in some cases, is it just a matter of not so much what they eat or don't but what can  
**[0:17:36-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:17:36):**  be attracted like the meat products or the fats or the sugars which could attract competing  
**[0:17:42-0:17:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:17:42):**  insects and fungus perhaps?  
**[0:17:45-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:17:45):**  Yeah, the meat and dairy, that could attract rats and other carnivorous animals.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:17:52):**  So give me an idea about how long it takes for them to process a certain amount of food  
**[0:17:57-0:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:17:57):**  and how long should you expect before you have finished vermicompost?  
**[0:18:03-0:18:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:18:03):**  Okay, so in a small bin like that, when the worms first arrive, they won't be hungry because  
**[0:18:14-0:18:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:18:14):**  they've just endured some kind of a journey where either they were delivered to you in  
**[0:18:20-0:18:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:18:20):**  the mail or you went and picked it up and it bounced around in your car.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:18:26):**  And so they're kind of shaken up and also you've just introduced them to a new environment  
**[0:18:31-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:18:31):**  that they're unfamiliar with.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:18:33):**  So sometimes worms want to get out of that environment.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:18:37):**  I haven't personally experienced that but I know that many people do have that issue  
**[0:18:44-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:18:44):**  and so if you do, then you want to keep light, an outside source of light on the bin for  
**[0:18:56-0:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:18:56):**  maybe a few days.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:18:59):**  So what that means is just have some kind of light shining in the room that the bin  
**[0:19:06-0:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:19:06):**  is in so that the worms, light bothers them and so they'll stay in the bin.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:19:18):**  And after they're kind of forced to stay in the bin like that, they'll adapt to the bin  
**[0:19:23-0:19:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:19:23):**  and then stay there.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:19:25):**  And so as far as eating, worms will eat about a quarter to a third of their weight per day  
**[0:19:33-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:19:33):**  and so this is true, this is not something you find on the internet.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:19:39):**  And so anyway, that's the case.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:19:43):**  But they're not machines, they're like us.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:19:49):**  We tend to eat more one day and less the next.  
**[0:19:52-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:19:52):**  So it's not a mechanical thing where you're like, okay, well let's see, I have this many  
**[0:20:02-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:20:02):**  worms and I've given them this much food and so it should be finished because that's what  
**[0:20:11-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:20:11):**  the math tells us.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:20:12):**  But we have to remember that we're dealing with living beings.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:20:15):**  Now, so we've talked a little bit about the food that they like and how to keep that in  
**[0:20:19-0:20:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:20:19):**  balance.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:20:21):**  What about moisture?  
**[0:20:22-0:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:20:22):**  You mentioned that they require quite a high moisture content and I mentioned the worm  
**[0:20:27-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:20:27):**  bin that I had had before had sort of a spout that you could collect moisture at the bottom  
**[0:20:32-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:20:32):**  of them.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:20:33):**  But how do you make sure that the moisture is maintained at a balance that they're going  
**[0:20:38-0:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:20:38):**  to thrive in?  
**[0:20:40-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:20:40):**  Okay, so what's key is that how you soak the bedding before you put it into the worm bin.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:20:50):**  So like I said, you're going to soak the bedding in clean water and then you're going to squeeze  
**[0:20:56-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:20:56):**  the excess liquid out.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:20:59):**  But if you squeeze paper, you don't want to just throw a ball of paper into the bin.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:21:05):**  So that's why I said you pull it apart.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:21:07):**  But you put it in there and by soaking it for 10 minutes, it means that all of the paper  
**[0:21:13-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:21:13):**  fibers are saturated.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:21:16):**  And so ideally, you shouldn't have to add more moisture.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:21:22):**  And you never ever pour water into a bin, even if you've seen it on YouTube.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:21:28):**  So because some people say, oh, just tear up the paper, put it in the bottom of the  
**[0:21:34-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:21:34):**  bin and then pour water on it.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:21:36):**  Well, you can't control it that way.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:21:41):**  And so this whole idea of having spouts on bins is ridiculous because you really should  
**[0:21:46-0:21:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:21:46):**  not produce that excess liquid.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:21:50):**  So you just put the, you've soaked the bedding for 10 minutes, it should be good to go and  
**[0:21:56-0:21:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:21:56):**  you really shouldn't need to add any moisture.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:21:59):**  But every time you open the bin, it will release a little bit of moisture.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:22:04):**  And so you may find that the top of the paper becomes kind of dried out.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:22:09):**  And so you can take a mister, you know, like a plant mister and just mist water to dampen  
**[0:22:17-0:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:22:17):**  the top of the bedding.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:22:19):**  And so it shouldn't need any more than that?  
**[0:22:21-0:22:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:22:21):**  If you notice that it starts to dry out, there's just a mister should be adequate?  
**[0:22:27-0:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:22:27):**  Well, I mean, it's drying out, but you just, you always just mist the water.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:22:32):**  Do not pour water in there.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:22:34):**  Gotcha.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:22:35):**  You know, and by having a lid with no holes in it, it creates a little bit of a, it becomes  
**[0:22:44-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:22:44):**  kind of like a terrarium, I guess, you know, where the water will evaporate a little bit.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:22:51):**  When you open your worm bin, there will be a little bit of liquid on the inside of the  
**[0:22:57-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:22:57):**  lid because of the evaporation taking place.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:23:02):**  But because the lid is solid and doesn't have holes and the water is not escaping, then  
**[0:23:08-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:23:08):**  it will just rain back down onto the bedding.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:23:11):**  And that helps.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:23:13):**  And we're just talking about small bins here with, you know, with lids.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:23:18):**  We're not talking about larger systems like what I wrote about in my book.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:23:22):**  Right.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:23:23):**  So again, with the smaller systems, if you've got one of these bins, we've balanced out  
**[0:23:28-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:23:28):**  the feeding and the moisture.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:23:30):**  Where should you store your bin in the most conducive environment for the health of your  
**[0:23:35-0:23:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:23:35):**  worms?  
**[0:23:36-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:23:36):**  Well, ideally, it would be in a location that is about 70 degrees Fahrenheit.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:23:43):**  So that's when the worms are most comfortable, which means they'll eat more and reproduce  
**[0:23:49-0:23:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:23:49):**  more and produce castings.  
**[0:23:54-0:23:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:23:54):**  So 70 is the best.  
**[0:23:56-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:23:56):**  But you just have to kind of do the best that you can.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:24:00):**  So yeah, that's ideal if you can keep it at 70.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:24:03):**  So if you have it indoors and you can keep the room 70 degrees, that's great.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:24:10):**  I tend to keep my worm bins outdoors.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:24:13):**  And so of course, the temperature is fluctuating.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:24:16):**  And so, you know, I just deal with that.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:24:20):**  Keeping it in the shade, you never ever want to put a worm bin in the sun because, you  
**[0:24:25-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:24:25):**  know, then things can get heated up.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:24:28):**  The worms are sensitive to temperatures.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:24:32):**  And so that's why I've written about that extensively.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:24:36):**  And you can find free publications on my website at composting.ces.ncsu.edu.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:24:48):**  So you'll find that, you know, when you go to that website, you click on vermicomposting.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:24:54):**  And we're talking about households right now.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:24:57):**  So you would click on four households and then you'll find my publication, Worms Can  
**[0:25:03-0:25:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:25:03):**  Recycle Your Garbage.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:25:04):**  Nice.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:25:05):**  So let's switch context a little bit because you did write extensively about this in your  
**[0:25:10-0:25:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:25:10):**  book.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:25:11):**  How do you scale up this production to make enough that's actually significant?  
**[0:25:16-0:25:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:25:16):**  Okay.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:25:17):**  And I'm glad you said scale up because I really do recommend that if people are interested  
**[0:25:24-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:25:24):**  in getting into the business of vermicomposting or say you have a farm or a community garden  
**[0:25:30-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:25:30):**  or, you know, you're producing a lot more organic material than what you could put into  
**[0:25:36-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:25:36):**  a small worm bin, I do recommend that you start with a small worm bin so that you get  
**[0:25:43-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:25:43):**  used to worm husbandry.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:25:47):**  So we talked about working out the balance of moisture.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:25:50):**  By having a small worm bin, you'll be able to observe how the moisture reacts in the  
**[0:25:55-0:26:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:25:55):**  bin, how it cycles, and you'll be able to, you know, you'll notice how fast the food  
**[0:26:04-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:26:04):**  is being consumed and how fast the worm castings are being produced.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:26:11):**  So you really kind of get the hang of earthworm husbandry by having a small bin.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:26:19):**  So then you decide to scale up and there are all sorts of, again, you don't have to have  
**[0:26:26-0:26:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:26:26):**  a bin.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:26:27):**  You know, some people have outdoor windrows or piles depending on your climate.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:26:34):**  But a lot of people have bins and some people if they tend to have, you know, like a garage  
**[0:26:41-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:26:41):**  or a basement or maybe they have some old farm buildings on site, those are all good  
**[0:26:51-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:26:51):**  places to put worm bins, keep them sheltered out of the sun and rain and cold weather or  
**[0:26:58-0:27:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:26:58):**  super hot weather.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:27:00):**  And so give us an example of your own operation, how you've scaled up the systems to produce  
**[0:27:08-0:27:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:27:08):**  or consult with other people as well who've been doing the same to produce a significant  
**[0:27:12-0:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:27:12):**  amount of compost that you can use on a garden.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:27:16):**  Okay.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:27:17):**  So yes, I started with a small bin about 25 years ago and then, you know, I'm here at  
**[0:27:26-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:27:26):**  a university and so I had use of a laboratory where I had seven worm bins, seven different  
**[0:27:36-0:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:27:36):**  styles of worm bins because you can of course buy them commercially too.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:27:41):**  So you know, I had can of worms and worm factory and you know, just a variety of bins where  
**[0:27:47-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:27:47):**  I would observe how they responded to the food that I was, you know, just the systems,  
**[0:27:54-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:27:54):**  you know.  
**[0:27:55-0:27:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:27:55):**  So it was kind of nice to do that.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:27:57):**  And then now I have an acre or two owned by the university but it's farmland and so I  
**[0:28:05-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:28:05):**  have what I call the compost learning lab and on it I have 14 different types of composting  
**[0:28:13-0:28:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:28:13):**  systems.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:28:15):**  So we're talking about, you know, thermophilic composting.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:28:18):**  And then I have the worm barn which is a 30 by 40 foot building that has, you know, like  
**[0:28:27-0:28:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:28:27):**  it's hard to describe but it is not a solid enclosed building.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:28:31):**  I don't have any electricity so of course I don't have any heating or cooling and there  
**[0:28:38-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:28:38):**  are open spaces where air just flows into this building.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:28:42):**  So I don't have the best environment.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:28:46):**  So if I were to become a commercial vermicomposter, I would not use the building that I have.  
**[0:28:55-0:29:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:28:55):**  But what I do have is great for showing people how to do vermicomposting.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:29:00):**  So I have 12 different types of worm bins in my worm barn ranging from small household  
**[0:29:08-0:29:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:29:08):**  bins so the, you know, the small $5 bins that I adapted into worm bins and then several  
**[0:29:19-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:29:19):**  commercially purchased worm bins and then I have medium scale like the worm wigwam and  
**[0:29:28-0:29:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:29:28):**  Oscar bin and then I have a 40 square foot bin that's a continuous flow through reactor  
**[0:29:36-0:29:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:29:36):**  so it's 8 feet by 5 feet.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:29:39):**  And people really like seeing, you know, the differences in sizes.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:29:44):**  And so the active vermicomposting that I have going on there are in plastic macro bins.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:29:52):**  So these are used by, I think primarily by farmers for after they harvest vegetables  
**[0:29:59-0:30:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:29:59):**  and fruits.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:30:01):**  They put them in these sturdy macro bins that are about 40-ish inches on each side and they  
**[0:30:12-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:30:12):**  have holes in, you know, in the bottom and the sides.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:30:19):**  And so when I saw it I thought, wow, this would make a good worm bin.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:30:23):**  And it has been a very good worm bin.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:30:25):**  So I have two of those in my worm barn and I'm feeding dairy manure to the worms.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:30:33):**  And I've also seen it at some other sites so I know other vermicomposters are using  
**[0:30:38-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:30:38):**  the macro bins.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:30:39):**  So among all of these different bin styles that you've had the opportunity to sort of  
**[0:30:44-0:30:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:30:44):**  explore and work with over time, which configuration is your favorite and why?  
**[0:30:49-0:30:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:30:49):**  Well really, I mean, the best is a continuous flow through reactor because the worm manure  
**[0:30:59-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:30:59):**  will always go to the bottom of a bin.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:31:03):**  And that means that you have to use a shovel to get to it, you know.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:31:09):**  And so, but with a continuous flow through reactor, it has a grate on the bottom that's  
**[0:31:14-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:31:14):**  either 4 inches by 2 inches or 2 inches by 2 inches.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:31:20):**  And there's a breaker bar that is activated by either motors or a hand crank and it will  
**[0:31:30-0:31:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:31:30):**  shave off about an inch of vermicompost off the bottom of this bin.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:31:37):**  And so it saves labor for harvesting because you don't have to dig it out with a shovel.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:31:43):**  Oh yeah, that's clever.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:31:45):**  And so you don't have to worry about any of the worms coming out with the castings  
**[0:31:49-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:31:49):**  in the bottom, they just migrate their way up where the food source is?  
**[0:31:54-0:32:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:31:54):**  Yes, worms, if a system is operating correctly, you know, if it has the right moisture balance  
**[0:32:04-0:32:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:32:04):**  and everything's operating well, the worms will stay in about the top 4 inches of a worm  
**[0:32:11-0:32:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:32:11):**  bin and they move up to eat.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:32:15):**  So for example, I mentioned that I'm feeding dairy manure and so about once a week, about  
**[0:32:23-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:32:23):**  an inch of dairy manure is applied to the top of both of my macro bins and the worms  
**[0:32:30-0:32:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:32:30):**  come up and eat it.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:32:32):**  And this dairy manure is kind of chunky, chunky clods, but after a week, I can tell that the  
**[0:32:42-0:32:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:32:42):**  manure has been processed by the worms because it creates what we call in the vermicomposting  
**[0:32:48-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:32:48):**  industry the pool table effect.  
**[0:32:52-0:33:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:32:52):**  So you put in this chunky feedstock and then after the worms have processed it, then it'll  
**[0:33:00-0:33:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:33:00):**  be flat like a pool table and then you'll know it's time to feed the worms again.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:33:05):**  Oh wow, that's a good visual cue so that you don't have any guesswork.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:33:10):**  Right, yep.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:33:11):**  So let's talk about some of these byproducts of worm farming.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:33:14):**  You mentioned how much more valuable and nutritious worm casting and worm compost is compared  
**[0:33:20-0:33:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:33:20):**  to conventional compost.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:33:22):**  What are the elements inside of this material that make it so valuable for a garden?  
**[0:33:29-0:33:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:33:29):**  Well, vermicompost is just teeming with microorganisms, just a variety of species and really high  
**[0:33:39-0:33:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:33:39):**  numbers of microorganisms that are beneficial to plants.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:33:45):**  And also, vermicompost contains humic acids and plant growth hormones such as gibberellins  
**[0:33:52-0:34:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:33:52):**  and cytokines and auxins and those really have a phenomenal effect on the plants.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:34:00):**  And they also contain nutrients that are in forms readily taken up by plants.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:34:05):**  And it's also fully stabilized because it's been ingested by an animal and it comes out  
**[0:34:11-0:34:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:34:11):**  the other end and so you don't have to cure it like compost and it's not going to burn  
**[0:34:17-0:34:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:34:17):**  plants like immature compost can do.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:34:21):**  And so you don't have to use this at full concentration, isn't that right?  
**[0:34:25-0:34:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:34:25):**  Because of all the added nutrients and microorganisms in it, oftentimes it's sort of diluted with  
**[0:34:31-0:34:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:34:31):**  other either conventional compost or perhaps sometimes potting soil mix?  
**[0:34:37-0:34:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:34:37):**  Yes, because actually a little bit goes a really long way and so a lot of plant, a lot  
**[0:34:47-0:34:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:34:47):**  of scientific studies have been done with plants and usually it shows that 10 or 20  
**[0:34:54-0:35:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:34:54):**  percent by volume vermicompost is all that's needed to produce this really phenomenal effect  
**[0:35:01-0:35:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:35:01):**  on plants.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:35:03):**  So it increases rates of germination and growth, flowering and fruiting and crop yields are  
**[0:35:10-0:35:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:35:10):**  higher and it improves root development and stress tolerance, which so there's decreased  
**[0:35:17-0:35:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:35:17):**  transplant shock and also many, many studies show there are decreased attacks by plant  
**[0:35:25-0:35:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:35:25):**  pathogens, parasitic nematodes and insect pests.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:35:29):**  Wow, that's incredible.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:35:30):**  So it's not just feeding your garden, it's actually protecting it as well.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:35:34):**  Yes.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:35:35):**  So you mentioned that only about 20 percent per volume is what's necessary.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:35:41):**  What do you make up the rest of that 80 percent with in your recommendation?  
**[0:35:45-0:35:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:35:45):**  Oh, I don't want to recommend because it really depends on the plant's needs and the soils  
**[0:35:51-0:35:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:35:51):**  and so I can't just make a blanket statement about that.  
**[0:35:54-0:36:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:35:54):**  But definitely having some compost in the mix is good, but otherwise I think it's important  
**[0:36:04-0:36:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:36:04):**  for people to talk to their local cooperative extension agent who's familiar with their  
**[0:36:11-0:36:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:36:11):**  more familiar with their soils and they can talk to them about making the right soil mix.  
**[0:36:20-0:36:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:36:20):**  That's good advice.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:36:21):**  So you mentioned earlier that you've had tons of people reach out to you from all over the  
**[0:36:27-0:36:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:36:27):**  world since you started to write about cultivating worms.  
**[0:36:31-0:36:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:36:31):**  Starting from questions and interest in vermicomposting and what have been some of the most frequently  
**[0:36:36-0:36:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:36:36):**  asked questions and concerns from the people that you've come into contact with?  
**[0:36:41-0:36:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:36:41):**  Well, I mean, you know, so they're all over the world and so people are dealing with waste,  
**[0:36:51-0:37:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:36:51):**  you know, so we're talking animal manures and crop residues and food waste and spoiled  
**[0:37:01-0:37:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:37:01):**  grain and coffee grounds and brewery waste and cardboard and scrap paper, just a variety  
**[0:37:08-0:37:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:37:08):**  of things and so they want to do something beneficial with it and restore their soils.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:37:14):**  So, you know, for example, the US military contacted me from Afghanistan and they said,  
**[0:37:25-0:37:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:37:25):**  you know, here we are over here and we've got food waste and we have humanure and we  
**[0:37:32-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:37:32):**  want to do the right thing and not burn it, you know, instead do something to recycle  
**[0:37:37-0:37:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:37:37):**  it back into the soils.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:37:39):**  So they were interested in vermicomposting.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:37:43):**  So people all over the world, you know, a lot of people, they don't have toilets like  
**[0:37:49-0:37:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:37:49):**  we do and so they have a lot of human waste that needs to be processed and so vermicomposting  
**[0:37:58-0:38:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:37:58):**  is playing a big role in that around the world as well.  
**[0:38:02-0:38:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:38:02):**  So it really depends and, you know, really vermicomposting is, you know, like households  
**[0:38:07-0:38:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:38:07):**  like what I have been talking about but then, you know, there's medium scale and I mentioned  
**[0:38:13-0:38:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:38:13):**  that, you know, that can be community gardens or small farms or schools that want to take  
**[0:38:20-0:38:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:38:20):**  their cafeteria waste and vermicompost it and then there are just some really huge operations  
**[0:38:28-0:38:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:38:28):**  and I really enjoyed writing profiles about them in my book and so I did talk about, you  
**[0:38:34-0:38:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:38:34):**  know, I mentioned all of these different places, you know, there's vermicomposting taking place  
**[0:38:39-0:38:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:38:39):**  at hospitals and schools and restaurants, grocery stores, military bases, paper mills,  
**[0:38:49-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:38:49):**  universities, prisons, all sorts of people, you know, anybody who generates food waste  
**[0:38:56-0:39:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:38:56):**  and so I really enjoyed profiling them because there are just some enormous vermicomposting  
**[0:39:04-0:39:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:39:04):**  operations taking place in Mexico and in New Zealand and just all over the world.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:39:14):**  But the country that I think I hear from the most is India and what something that I am  
**[0:39:23-0:39:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:39:23):**  most like very happy about is that vermicomposting is playing a huge role in giving women financial  
**[0:39:34-0:39:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:39:34):**  independence in countries where it's, you know, a struggle for them to survive.  
**[0:39:42-0:39:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:39:42):**  So that's taking place in India and Guatemala and, you know, other places around the world.  
**[0:39:49-0:39:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:39:49):**  Yeah, I know initiatives like that are increasingly popular here in Guatemala where I live and  
**[0:39:54-0:40:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:39:54):**  it's really inspiring to see these groups take on something that can have such a beneficial  
**[0:40:01-0:40:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:40:01):**  impact for our environment but also bring up the economic value of these types of products  
**[0:40:07-0:40:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:40:07):**  while giving access to women and impoverished communities to be producing something of such  
**[0:40:14-0:40:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:40:14):**  high value.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:40:15):**  I was really happy to hear that the military had gotten in touch with you because that's  
**[0:40:19-0:40:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:40:19):**  not an organization that we normally associate with making environmentally sound decisions.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:40:24):**  So it's inspiring to see how this shift is starting to affect even associations and organizations  
**[0:40:31-0:40:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:40:31):**  that we wouldn't expect that from.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:40:35):**  Well, and actually military bases here in the United States are, many of them are composting  
**[0:40:43-0:40:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:40:43):**  or vermicomposting their food waste because think about it, you just have thousands of  
**[0:40:49-0:40:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:40:49):**  people who are housed on these bases and, you know, they have dining halls for the troops  
**[0:40:56-0:41:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:40:56):**  and they have families living there and so a lot of food waste is being generated.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:41:02):**  And so it behooves them to save money and do the right thing by choosing environmentally  
**[0:41:09-0:41:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:41:09):**  beneficial alternatives instead of, you know, because it's expensive for them to haul food  
**[0:41:15-0:41:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:41:15):**  waste to a landfill and so it can be cheaper for them to recycle it right on site through  
**[0:41:22-0:41:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:41:22):**  vermicomposting or composting and then they end up with this beneficial product that they  
**[0:41:29-0:41:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:41:29):**  can use to restore the soils and grow food right on the military bases.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:41:35):**  So yeah, it's happening and it makes sense.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:41:38):**  That's really encouraging and I know there's one story in particular from the book that  
**[0:41:42-0:41:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:41:42):**  you have in the intro when you got an unexpected call from someone who you thought was a farmhand.  
**[0:41:48-0:41:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:41:48):**  You want to tell me about that?  
**[0:41:50-0:41:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:41:50):**  Yes.  
**[0:41:51-0:41:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:41:51):**  Well, as you can imagine, since I've heard from people in 111 countries that pretty much  
**[0:41:58-0:42:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:41:58):**  daily I receive emails from people in other countries and it makes my job very interesting.  
**[0:42:05-0:42:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:42:05):**  And so anyway, I opened an email and it was from someone in Argentina who was at a farm  
**[0:42:13-0:42:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:42:13):**  and they wanted to scale up to a large vermicomposting system.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:42:20):**  And so, you know, I just – it was a very busy period – well, I'm always busy but  
**[0:42:28-0:42:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:42:28):**  I think this was exceptionally busy because he started emailing me pretty much every day,  
**[0:42:34-0:42:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:42:34):**  you know, so we had this dialogue going on but I just had it in my mind that he was a  
**[0:42:39-0:42:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:42:39):**  farm worker on a really large farm in Argentina.  
**[0:42:45-0:42:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:42:45):**  And it turned out that he was billionaire Doug Tompkins who founded the North Face.  
**[0:42:52-0:42:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:42:52):**  Imagine that.  
**[0:42:54-0:42:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:42:54):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:55-0:43:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:42:55):**  And so, you know, it's really – so yeah, so after a couple of weeks of emailing he  
**[0:43:03-0:43:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:43:03):**  said he was coming to visit Duke University Medical Center and then I thought, oh no,  
**[0:43:10-0:43:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:43:10):**  this poor farm worker must have a terrible fatal disease or something for his boss to  
**[0:43:18-0:43:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:43:18):**  send him all the way to Duke for medical care.  
**[0:43:24-0:43:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:43:24):**  So anyway, I met him and was shocked to find out that he had founded Andespri and he was  
**[0:43:35-0:43:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:43:35):**  the largest private owner of land in the world.  
**[0:43:41-0:43:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:43:41):**  So he had, you know, cashed out of the North Face and Esprit and had taken his money to  
**[0:43:50-0:44:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:43:50):**  South America and he had purchased 2.5 million acres in Argentina and Chile and he had restored  
**[0:44:02-0:44:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:44:02):**  the land.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:44:03):**  It was amazing what he did because, you know, he was buying these huge ranches where, you  
**[0:44:09-0:44:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:44:09):**  know, the soil had just been destroyed through ranching and he turned them into beautiful  
**[0:44:15-0:44:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:44:15):**  organic farms and created national parks and then gave the national parks to the governments.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:44:23):**  And so it was in the news a few months ago about how there's I think like an 1800-mile  
**[0:44:28-0:44:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:44:28):**  trail through Chile through connecting national parks that were created by Doug Tompkins.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:44:35):**  Doug and his wife, Chris Tompkins and their foundation.  
**[0:44:39-0:44:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:44:39):**  So I went down to visit them and spent I think 16 days down there and it was just amazing  
**[0:44:45-0:44:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:44:45):**  and really overwhelming.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:44:46):**  But he was very committed that every one of his organic farms had they were doing composting  
**[0:44:53-0:44:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:44:53):**  and vermicomposting.  
**[0:44:54-0:44:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:44:54):**  It was very impressive.  
**[0:44:57-0:45:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:44:57):**  And that's so encouraging because we hear so many stories about, you know, people with  
**[0:45:02-0:45:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:45:02):**  immense wealth or extreme influence and power sort of perpetuating the destructive cycles  
**[0:45:08-0:45:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:45:08):**  that we see so often in our society and in our culture that when somebody rediverts those  
**[0:45:15-0:45:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:45:15):**  resources into something so productive, so positive, I think it can really have a major  
**[0:45:21-0:45:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:45:21):**  downstream effect to inspire people to do similar things with the resources that they  
**[0:45:26-0:45:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:45:26):**  have themselves.  
**[0:45:27-0:45:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:45:27):**  That's so encouraging to hear.  
**[0:45:29-0:45:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:45:29):**  Yes.  
**[0:45:30-0:45:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:45:30):**  Yeah.  
**[0:45:31-0:45:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:45:31):**  He was very inspiring.  
**[0:45:32-0:45:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:45:32):**  And I'm using past tense because unfortunately he passed away a few years ago.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:45:38):**  So.  
**[0:45:39-0:45:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:45:39):**  Well, certainly that's a respectable legacy to leave behind.  
**[0:45:44-0:45:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:45:44):**  So his foundation is still there and they love to have interns come and work on the  
**[0:45:50-0:45:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:45:50):**  organic farms.  
**[0:45:52-0:46:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:45:52):**  And so you can look up Doug Tompkins Foundation and if anybody is interested in getting incredible  
**[0:46:02-0:46:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:46:02):**  experience on organic farms in South America.  
**[0:46:05-0:46:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:46:05):**  Nice.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:46:06):**  So do you have any other information that you'd like to share with my audience on not  
**[0:46:11-0:46:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:46:11):**  only where they can find and purchase your book, but other resources to learn more about  
**[0:46:17-0:46:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:46:17):**  vermicomposting in particular and how they can contact you?  
**[0:46:23-0:46:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:46:23):**  Okay.  
**[0:46:24-0:46:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:46:24):**  So since I said that I've accidentally become world famous for vermicomposting, most of  
**[0:46:33-0:46:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:46:33):**  the information on my website is about vermicomposting, although I have written quite a bit about  
**[0:46:40-0:46:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:46:40):**  composting as well.  
**[0:46:42-0:46:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:46:42):**  And I have extensive experience with composting.  
**[0:46:45-0:46:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:46:45):**  And so I incorporated that into my book too, because I do encourage pre-composting.  
**[0:46:53-0:46:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:46:53):**  If you're going to sell vermicompost, I think there are just a lot of good reasons for doing  
**[0:46:58-0:47:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:46:58):**  pre-composting.  
**[0:47:00-0:47:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:47:00):**  And so, so my book that just came out in November is called the worm farmer's handbook, mid  
**[0:47:07-0:47:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:47:07):**  to large scale vermicomposting for farms, businesses, municipalities, schools, and institutions.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:47:15):**  And it's published by Chelsea Green publishing and it's available from them and anyone who  
**[0:47:24-0:47:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:47:24):**  sells books.  
**[0:47:25-0:47:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:47:25):**  And so you can, you know, whoever you like to buy books from, hopefully it's a local  
**[0:47:30-0:47:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:47:30):**  independent bookstore.  
**[0:47:32-0:47:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:47:32):**  But if you prefer, you know, Barnes and Noble or Amazon, it's sold by Target, Walmart.  
**[0:47:40-0:47:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:47:40):**  I mean, it's crazy.  
**[0:47:41-0:47:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:47:41):**  You just, you know, Google the worm farmer's handbook and it'll pop up for sale in different  
**[0:47:47-0:47:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:47:47):**  places.  
**[0:47:48-0:47:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:47:48):**  So, but this, there's just so much information in there that is really valuable.  
**[0:47:56-0:48:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:47:56):**  And so I encourage you to read this and it's kind of a fun read too.  
**[0:48:01-0:48:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:48:01):**  It's interesting.  
**[0:48:02-0:48:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:48:02):**  I agree.  
**[0:48:03-0:48:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:48:03):**  I got a lot out of it myself.  
**[0:48:05-0:48:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:48:05):**  Yeah.  
**[0:48:06-0:48:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:48:06):**  I use my own voice for this, you know, cause at the university I use third person voice,  
**[0:48:11-0:48:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:48:11):**  but this was my book and my voice and my experience.  
**[0:48:15-0:48:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:48:15):**  And so I really enjoyed that and it came through in the book, lots of colored pictures and  
**[0:48:21-0:48:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:48:21):**  just seeing operations all over the world.  
**[0:48:24-0:48:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:48:24):**  Like you know, there's a woman owned vermicomposting operation in Afghanistan.  
**[0:48:30-0:48:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:48:30):**  And so I've got photos in there and you know, just all sorts of interesting things and compost  
**[0:48:37-0:48:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:48:37):**  or vermicomposting of cafeteria food waste at schools in the United States that hopefully  
**[0:48:46-0:48:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:48:46):**  will inspire people to do that.  
**[0:48:48-0:48:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:48:48):**  And speaking of schools, also when you click on vermicomposting on my website, you'll see  
**[0:48:54-0:48:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:48:54):**  for schools and you can click on that.  
**[0:48:57-0:49:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:48:57):**  And I have information for schools to get, um, to get started with vermicomposting.  
**[0:49:03-0:49:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:49:03):**  And I also have a curriculum.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:49:05):**  So anybody who works with children, whether it be preschool, regular school, um, scouts,  
**[0:49:13-0:49:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:49:13):**  church groups, homeschooling, anybody can use this free curriculum.  
**[0:49:19-0:49:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:49:19):**  And it says that it's for fifth graders, but we just said that because it's aligned with  
**[0:49:24-0:49:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:49:24):**  fifth grade standards in North Carolina, but actually it can be adapted for any age child.  
**[0:49:31-0:49:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:49:31):**  So from, you know, young children on up through 12th grade.  
**[0:49:35-0:49:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:49:35):**  That is a fantastic resource.  
**[0:49:36-0:49:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:49:36):**  And you said that's available through your website?  
**[0:49:38-0:49:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:49:38):**  Yeah.  
**[0:49:39-0:49:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:49:39):**  So all this free information on my website.  
**[0:49:43-0:49:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:49:43):**  And then the largest category for the vermicomposting, you click on four businesses, farms, um, what  
**[0:49:51-0:49:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:49:51):**  is it, businesses, farms, and institutions, and municipalities.  
**[0:49:57-0:50:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:49:57):**  And so there's a lot of information there because that's what I get the most, um, the  
**[0:50:02-0:50:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:50:02):**  most people contact me.  
**[0:50:05-0:50:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:50:05):**  They're interested in, um, converting large amounts of waste into vermicompost or making  
**[0:50:11-0:50:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:50:11):**  money from vermicompost, creating vermicompost.  
**[0:50:14-0:50:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:50:14):**  So I have the most information there.  
**[0:50:17-0:50:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:50:17):**  So you'll find Raising Earthworms Successfully.  
**[0:50:20-0:50:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:50:20):**  So that's free to download.  
**[0:50:22-0:50:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:50:22):**  I think it's like 14 pages or something.  
**[0:50:25-0:50:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:50:25):**  And um, you know, so that gives you a, uh, an overview of how to get into mid to large  
**[0:50:33-0:50:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:50:33):**  scale vermicomposting.  
**[0:50:35-0:50:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:50:35):**  But my book has obviously so much more information.  
**[0:50:39-0:50:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:50:39):**  So you know, if you're serious about it, it would be wise to buy the book.  
**[0:50:44-0:50:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:50:44):**  Nice.  
**[0:50:45-0:50:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:50:45):**  Well, yeah, that's such a fantastic resource and I'll be sure to link to that on all of  
**[0:50:50-0:50:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:50:50):**  the show notes for this podcast episode on our website as well.  
**[0:50:55-0:50:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:50:55):**  Rhonda, it was such a pleasure talking to you.  
**[0:50:57-0:51:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:50:57):**  I really got a lot out of this and especially the troubleshooting part because I had had  
**[0:51:01-0:51:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:51:01):**  sort of mixed results with my own home vermicomposting bins in the past.  
**[0:51:06-0:51:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:51:06):**  I definitely have a clear vision going forward now.  
**[0:51:09-0:51:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:51:09):**  Oh good.  
**[0:51:10-0:51:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:51:10):**  That's great.  
**[0:51:11-0:51:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:51:11):**  Yeah.  
**[0:51:12-0:51:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:51:12):**  I really encourage people to, you know, read the Worms Can Recycle Your Garbage.  
**[0:51:16-0:51:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:51:16):**  Just read it two or three times before you get started with vermicomposting because you  
**[0:51:22-0:51:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:51:22):**  know, it's simple, but there are a lot of ways things can go wrong.  
**[0:51:27-0:51:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:51:27):**  And so, you know, it's just good to be mindful.  
**[0:51:29-0:51:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:51:29):**  And I do have a troubleshooting guide within that, within Worms Can Recycle Your Garbage.  
**[0:51:35-0:51:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:51:35):**  So you can also check that and see if you know how you can tweak your worm bin.  
**[0:51:40-0:51:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:51:40):**  Perfect.  
**[0:51:41-0:51:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:51:41):**  Well, Rhonda, thank you so much for taking the time today.  
**[0:51:45-0:51:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:51:45):**  I'll definitely be contacting you again in the future and hopefully we can do a follow  
**[0:51:49-0:51:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:51:49):**  up interview perhaps in a later season.  
**[0:51:51-0:51:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:51:51):**  That sounds great.  
**[0:51:52-0:51:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rhonda-sherman/#t=0:51:52):**  I really enjoyed it.

**[0:00:00-0:00:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast. I'm your host Oliver Gaucher and this is the podcast that talks all about the worlds of natural building, permaculture, and regenerative living.  
**[0:00:10-0:00:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:00:10):**  I've got a great guest for you today. His name is Shad Goodsy and he's the co-owner of both the Bamboo Hotel and Atitlan Organics, a fantastic self-sustaining permaculture farm right here on Lake Atitlan, Guatemala.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:00:23):**  In this interview, we get into growing a complete diet on your farm, interacting with local farmers and workers in a foreign country, and Shad gives great advice on the first three steps on setting up your own farm.  
**[0:00:35-0:01:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:00:35):**  Now stay tuned at the end of this episode because Shad requested that I remove a little section of the interview in order to be included at a later part which will be posted on the website at AbundantEdge.com forward slash podcast and include some really good business advice that he's applied on his farm, in the hotel, and some of the other endeavors including teaching that have helped him to manage and organize his finances.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:01:01):**  Just a real quick disclaimer before we get started, there are a couple of instances of strong language in this interview, so if you have young listeners, this might not be the appropriate interview for them.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:01:11):**  Alright, let's get started.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:01:13):**  Shad, thank you so much for spending some time with me today. We're here at the farm, Atitlan Organics, right next to the goats, so they might even choose to contribute to the podcast as well. It's a gorgeous day, how are you doing?  
**[0:01:36-0:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:01:36):**  I'm doing great Oliver, thanks a lot for having me, glad to be here with you, it's a lovely day, and yeah, let's get into it.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:01:44):**  Alright, let's start it right off the bat.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:01:46):**  How did you go from living in New Jersey to owning land in rural Guatemala and starting a permaculture farm? What were the steps that made all this happen?  
**[0:01:54-0:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:01:54):**  Okay, so I was working, after New Jersey I went to college, then graduated and went to Rhode Island for two years to work in a small consulting firm. During that time I paid off my student loans, it's not only the goats, the pigs are here too, if you hear them you'll know that's what it is.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:02:14):**  All sorts of contributions.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:02:16):**  And after paying off my student loans, I was dating Colleen, who's now my wife, and at the time we both agreed we wanted to quit that job and travel.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:02:28):**  And I was kind of on the fence about traveling, I had traveled a little before, but really I was into farming and gardening, I'd been a gardener for a bunch of years.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:02:37):**  Had heard about permaculture maybe a few years prior to quitting my job, and kind of had the idea that I would travel and then whenever that kind of finished I would come back and take over my great uncle's farm, which was like an industrial 60 acre chemical cabbage and pepper farm.  
**[0:02:56-0:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:02:56):**  And I had dreams of converting it and all that.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:02:59):**  But anyway we started traveling and the plan was to do two months in Belize, two months in Nicaragua, two months in Costa Rica, and in the first stay in Belize we took a little detour halfway through our time there and found the lake, found Lake Atitlan in Guatemala.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:03:15):**  My wife had actually been there before so she's the one who suggested we come back and see it.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:03:19):**  The first night we met a hostel owner who wanted to travel and was looking for someone to take care of his hostel and one thing led to another, we ended up going back to Belize, getting our stuff, coming back, and renting this hostel for the remainder of our trip, which was like six months.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:03:35):**  Back to the US and then once again back straight to Guatemala and we ended up renting the hostel for two more years. So we ended up staying at the lake for two years, during which time we had originally intended to travel.  
**[0:03:49-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:03:49):**  With that money that I had saved for traveling I didn't have to spend it and towards the tail end of that in October 2009 my wife and I liked the lake a lot and still had really vague plans but decided to use some of the money we had not spent traveling to buy a small piece of land, which has now become Atitlan Organics.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:04:09):**  Well that's quite a story. So you've got quite a few diverse systems here on the farm. Did you design the whole place from the beginning or has this all happened organically?  
**[0:04:19-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:04:19):**  Definitely was not designed exactly from the beginning. No. Like what you see now, definitely a lot of what you see now it wasn't even on my possibility radar when we took over.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:04:35):**  So you just learned a lot as you've gone through and come up with new possibilities as things have presented themselves?  
**[0:04:42-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:04:42):**  Learned a lot for sure whether I come up with the possibilities or the possibilities present themselves or people give you the idea that you just didn't have before. Who knows where it comes from?  
**[0:05:00-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:05:00):**  Nice. So what have been some of the key differences in working in this unique ecosystem of high altitude tropics having come from the American Northeast?  
**[0:05:11-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:05:11):**  That's an interesting one. We could spend a lot of time on just that. At the beginning the first obvious observation is that in the Northeast where I'm from you have winter and a summer and then you have the spring and fall edge transition seasons but it's really defined by a freeze and then a hop.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:05:33):**  Here the obvious correlation or mirrored pattern is dry and wet. So instead of cold and hot it's dry and wet.  
**[0:05:45-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:05:45):**  So that alone takes some getting used to but I always used to wonder where are the edge seasons? Where's the fall here and where's the spring here? If the summer is the dry season and the winter is the wet season then where's the spring and fall?  
**[0:06:03-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:06:03):**  And I think that's where the metaphor, the analogy kind of falls apart. Like here you either choose to look at it as all one kind of bland season. Not bland but one season. Or you see that actually almost every month there's new things.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:06:18):**  Here there's a windy month. There's all these different things. And even during the rainy season there's different types of rain and the way it comes in and there's always a little dry part in the rainy season. So it's a whole different thing and it's quite nuanced.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:06:33):**  Topographically parts of the Northeast probably look like this but where I'm from it's flat and quite coastal and this is quite very rocky and very steep so the land is broken and that completely changes the strategies.  
**[0:06:49-0:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:06:49):**  You can't build a chicken tractor on this land. You wouldn't move it more than a couple of feet before you hit the field trails. Wheelbarrow is non-existent. You basically have to spend a couple of days making a path for your wheelbarrow if you want to use a wheelbarrow.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:07:02):**  So topographically there's a lot of extreme differences between the two. And understanding that even though there's a 12 month growing season we can grow year round and that's very awesome and fortunate. We don't get any more sunlight.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:07:18):**  So the Northeast gets those 18 hour days and certain things really love that. You think you're here and you should be able to grow everything but you actually forget that you never really get more than 13 hours of sunlight. So there's a lot of nuanced differences as well.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:07:34):**  Sure. And so within all those nuances what are some of the primary relationships that make this ecosystem work. This ecosystem on our farm or this ecosystem like the lake ecosystem. Let's focus on the farm.  
**[0:07:48-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:07:48):**  Okay. There's a book called The Self-Sufficient Life and How to Lead It or How to Live It. The Self-Sufficient Life and How to Live It by John Seymour. A great book. It's like a classic. You ever see it?  
**[0:08:04-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:08:04):**  I haven't read that one. No. I put that in the show notes.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:08:07):**  Yeah it's great. It's great. It was definitely one of those first books you read and you're just like this dude is a ninja. He just knows everything. The book has everything from how to tap a spring to how to build living fences, how to build a house, to how to ferment honey wines, make yogurt. Everything.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:08:25):**  And it's awesome. Great invaluable beginner's homesteading resource for sure. And in that book he says nothing keeps the health of a farm and a family like a milk cow. Like a dairy cow.  
**[0:08:44-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:08:44):**  We don't have any cows here. But I do really think that the goat in a sense is the key nurturing force that's on the farm. Everything kind of moves around the goats in a sense. We don't have that many goats.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:09:05):**  They're not what makes the most money. They're one of the most profitable for sure. But chicken makes us more money. But the goats they eat stuff that nothing else eats. There's an abundance of it around here. And otherwise really the only thing to do. Maybe chickens eat a small amount of it. Maybe the pigs eat a small amount of it. Maybe you turn it into compost. But the goats will do a better job of that than you can.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:09:30):**  So you basically look all these mountains. That's cheese. That's yogurt. You know that's goat meat. So we're getting stuff that has no value that people just burn and we're turning it into like super high value like quote unquote economic from the from the value added products we make.  
**[0:09:47-0:10:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:09:47):**  But then what comes out the other end the manure we treat it really properly. We honor it. We respect it. We balance it with carbon which is one of our biggest inputs in the farm. We grow a shit ton of carbon. We use a lot of carbon. We bring in as much as we can still. We get bales of hay. We get wood shavings. It's like anything we can get our hands on we bring it up.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:10:08):**  We layer that between the goat manure and the goat urine and then that like sparks everything else and then that goes to the chicken house and the chickens turn the hell out of that and they poop in it and they mix it up and then we let it compost down and we dig it out and then that goes to the food forest to the vegetables to everything and then that all stuff helps to feed the goats again.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:10:27):**  So I really think the goats are like one of those nodes that have tons of connections to the system you know they kind of key everything in everything else. There's others like that you know.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:10:39):**  I want to make it clear we're not a goat farm. Right. But it's what they're one of those like they're like a high contributor. Exactly. Now you produce a lot of your own food here and you also produce a majority of the food that you sell at the Bamboo Hotel.  
**[0:10:52-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:10:52):**  How do you prioritize what crops to grow and in what quantity to meet such a big demand from a relatively small piece of land. Yeah. So it's you know we're still we're still not quite where I want to be.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:11:06):**  You know you'll never be you know hopefully you always have something to work towards. Let's say that. But the dream for the bamboo is yes I would love to be like you know 70 percent of what is on the bamboo plate is from Atitlan Organics and the other  
**[0:11:21-0:11:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:11:21):**  30 percent is from right in the say 50 kilometer radius from our point. And that would include the corn. We're lucky enough to live right next to the coast. I just came back from the beach. So we get all our sea salt from the beach right from there we get you know.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:11:36):**  So even if there was small things how do you get that source of coconut oil and things like that can come from there. So I really do think we can achieve this by a regional and super local and farm to table thing at the bamboo.  
**[0:11:50-0:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:11:50):**  Again at our house the original kind of first five years the bamboo wasn't here and we were. How do we grow all our own food. How do we grow all the food that we eat. So two of the bigger challenges I'll say for growing food.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:12:08):**  If you want to if you want to if you want to feel that feeling that says if everything else collapse around us we could still pretty much feed ourselves. Right. You know the two big challenges we've found have been grains cereals or energy crops the  
**[0:12:28-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:12:28):**  carbohydrate like here potatoes don't grow really well and there's so many rocks and even those sweet potatoes do like is a lot of investment to make a huge bed of sweet potatoes. You have to take out so many rocks and dig is like it's like a kind of a tricky thing in other parts of soon or not they grow real well.  
**[0:12:45-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:12:45):**  So I'm talking more about our little area here. So so one was carbohydrate and we found taro root taro root or malanga. It's a staple root crop. They grew it in Hawaii. They still grow it in Hawaii. All the Polynesian Islands Fiji other stuff.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:13:02):**  Tara you might see it in like fancy chip mixes it's purple and white like speckled purple. It's awesome. It's just like a potato. We grow that everywhere on the farm. So we when we found that out we were like whoa we can grow like that. You can live on Tara and goat cheese, you know, like that's a complete diet. Right. So like we were like, all right, we got it. We did that and now we sell like 10 or 15 pounds of taro every week to the hotel and it's not the only route they use but it's there and it's there.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:13:31):**  It's your main carbohydrate. So that was like one little success. We had to kind of figure out and the other one was fats. Like where do you fats come from? If you really are serious about growing your own food. How do you how do you saute a vegetable? How do you get any oil? Right? It's tricky without mechanization.  
**[0:13:51-0:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:13:51):**  Wheat and all those small grains, oats and all that stuff becomes quite impractical. Corn is still insanely labor intensive. You ever watch the local mine women, they have all the tricks with empty corn cob, and then a full corn cob with all the seeds still on it and they use the empty one to get the seeds off the big corn cob with a full corn cob. That's a hard job.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:14:14):**  Imagine doing that for every tortilla you're going to eat and then you have to grind it with a stone. You know, so think compare that to like digging a potato out of the ground. So grain is like really crazy. But then the oils in those grains are even harder because then once you get that sunflower out of the head or once you get that flax seed out of the head or once you get that whatever corn you're going to press for your oil, then you have to press it and then you know, and then you have to store it so it quickly becomes not worth the calories you're getting out. Yeah, it's hard without proper mechanization.  
**[0:14:43-0:15:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:14:43):**  And I'm not against mechanization. But like if you have too many moving pieces, the system becomes too complex. It doesn't always sustain itself. There's more to fail. So where do you get your fats? That was the other question. And really, it's from animals. Sure. It's from pigs from the lard. And that's easy, you know, in on a on on a fire that you can make right next to you, you can get all your fat you need for a year, you know, from a pig. So so those two things were real important and grow the diet and we prioritize to them because they're not going to be able to grow the diet.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:15:12):**  Prioritize to them because of that going back to your question, what do we prioritize and growing all this food was like, well, we had to figure out a grow the carbohydrate, we had to figure out how to do the fat, the protein we got just by the nature of what we do the milk and the cheese and chicken and eggs and all that other stuff. Now we're in the bamboo and basically we sell, you know, we have more eggs in the bamboo by so they're not our only customers say, but all their eggs come from us, all their dairy comes from us, all their chicken comes from us, all the honey, all the coffee, a lot of the stuff that's in the  
**[0:15:27-0:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:15:27):**  market, and they're not organic, really, whatever, they're just like, they're probably locally grown, but they're just like the regular, you know, the ones that are in the market. And so, you know, we're not going to be able to grow the diet, you know, because we're not going to be able to grow the food, you know, because we're not going to be able to grow the food.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:15:45):**  So you know, we're still buying vegetables, but they're still buying a lot of vegetables and we spend a lot of money on vegetables from the market, and they're not organic really whatever they're just like they're probably locally grown, but they're just like the regular vegetable.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:15:58):**  And it's because here we don't have a strong horticulture we just not focused so much on vegetables beyond salad greens and cooking greens. So that's currently that's put it this way we've kind of got all the animal products down.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:16:11):**  I've been working for the past year on my main project has been my back garden, and one of the multiple goals is developing seeds, like, but this is not a short term project because you have to trial everything see what works then save those seeds and grow them out and save them again  
**[0:16:28-0:16:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:16:28):**  like you have to prove that they work here is really like a year and a half to two years minimum for any seed crop, and I'm on it we're a year into it. I'm trying like 14 different vegetables that I want to work with.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:16:41):**  Hopefully I'll be able to share those seeds out to people here but also have the tools we need with the compost to to clear a nice piece of land to grow full veg for the restaurant and other people so that's like the newest priorities is the vegetable portion, we got the milango we got the other stuff.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:16:57):**  Sure. Now, many of the neighboring farms like you're talking about still rely on model crops chemical fertilizers insecticides to turn a profit.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:17:07):**  What has been your relationship with other local farmers in your community with the difference in practices that you've implemented.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:17:15):**  Um, you know, like so the people who work here are implementing this stuff on their own pieces and also buying more land valuing land for sure more.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:17:31):**  We've had varying things for two years I worked for an NGO and I was the agricultural specialist for four for four communities sooner not San Juan male power melon trees on shock.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:17:45):**  So I we build about 60 family gardens we put in for community gardens we did work with some farmers as well.  
**[0:17:52-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:17:52):**  So what do you think the agriculture here is still quite like textured and varied. It's a lot of coffee. A lot of people have coffee.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:18:02):**  That includes shade trees and firewood.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:18:08):**  So what you know part of it is someone once said to me, there's a guy who runs an NGO, they work on the coast, they work in like the flatter lands and the coast and he was like, he said farming in the highlands is dead, is what he said to me.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:18:22):**  And it's kind of true. Most highland like highlands here in the lake they're densely populated and there's more economy. There's more stories there's more tourism there's more of all this stuff.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:18:35):**  So instead of having a cornfield or this garden type space tomato field that you have to visit once a week and keep up on and then it requires a lot of stuff.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:18:45):**  Most people just put things in coffee. They visit it once a month. Let's take the family out, you know on a Sunday to the coffee field and and they have other jobs and they have other things.  
**[0:18:54-0:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:18:54):**  So I don't know what any of our impact is on the on the local community and something that I imagine will probably come up in the interview soon but for the first six years I feel like the farm was struggling just to make its earnings make its earnings and finally in the past year we've like rounded this corner and I feel like we actually we know the money's there and coming in and working for us and like  
**[0:19:23-0:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:19:23):**  all right now we can afford to pay everyone and there's still a little left over and I think not only does that we're going to start doing profit sharing but it also means that we have more time and resources to perform community service.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:19:37):**  We just don't know what that looks like yet and it can't just be me saying what it is so it's me Nikolas and Juan the three people who work on the farm together collectively talking these ideas.  
**[0:19:46-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:19:46):**  Very cool. So I know you're also taking a lot of volunteers students and apprentices all throughout the year. How have all these visitors and contributors helped to develop a teatland organics and how have you managed so many people coming and going.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:20:04):**  Yeah that's also a good question. Several years ago you know when we first started the first two years it was just me and Colleen here. We didn't have any volunteers. We still to be clear don't host anyone on the farm sleeping wise.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:20:17):**  You know it's just just people coming during the day.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:20:23):**  I always kind of knew we would be a wolf host. That's how I started traveling was by wolfing and I just kind of figured that we would participate in that program. To be fair, things like Wolf and HelpX have a reputation that the host charge for the volunteers.  
**[0:20:40-0:21:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:20:40):**  I think in developed countries in industrialized countries where labor is expensive. Wolf is usually free. Like if I had if I have Market Garden in New Jersey. If I could get woofers in New Jersey I would house and feed them for sure because it's cheaper to house and feed someone than it is to pay them to weed and do things you need them to do in Guatemala is the exact opposite.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:21:04):**  There's amazingly capacitated strong like competent people who are looking for employment and it's less expensive no matter how much you pay than it is to house and feed someone.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:21:19):**  We've always chosen to work like to depend on our local community and not international travelers. Part of it from the beginning is I don't like even hotels like in the kitchens a lot of kitchens and hotels and receptions run on volunteer staff.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:21:35):**  I never want to do that because I think the local community should be also part of the projects but also that they're here and they're not going anywhere.  
**[0:21:50-0:22:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:21:50):**  So basically we grew into it the first two years we didn't have anyone come on and then we rented a small guest house that a local family owned month to month and we put a few volunteers captive at four and they would come up for four hours and work and we would give them lunch.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:22:14):**  That was the exchange and they paid a really small fee to the family direct to the family so it was very clear we weren't making any money.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:22:22):**  Since then it's evolved and has done different things. About five years ago I got invited to teach my first permaculture design course with Ronnie Leck at the Mesoamerican Institute of Permaculture.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:22:33):**  It was a week there and a week here and we co-facilitated it. This was the fifth annual one we did was just this past December 2016.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:22:45):**  About two years ago we started hosting week-long workshops almost every month.  
**[0:22:52-0:23:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:22:52):**  So that kind of sums up what kind of visitors do we get. Well about five years ago we started hosting volunteers for the first time in various capacities never sleeping here.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:23:03):**  Now for the past two years they sleep at the bamboo.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:23:06):**  But then we also host week-long workshops every month and then also a couple of PDCs a year always in conjunction with someone else.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:23:16):**  Now I first met you when I came a few months ago to assist on a natural building workshop with Liz Gjondro that you hosted here.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:23:23):**  Why has natural building been a priority for your development on the farm also of course in the bamboo hotel which is a natural building and part of the curriculum that you offer here from time to time?  
**[0:23:34-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:23:34):**  Well this show the course where we met was the second natural building course that Atitlán Organics has hosted with Liz Gjondro and Charlie Rendell.  
**[0:23:46-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:23:46):**  After the first course admittedly I was very minimally involved in the day-to-day and I picked up some things just because this is such a great teacher and even just being there 10 minutes you pick up something awesome.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:24:01):**  But admittedly minimally involved after that course we built three natural animal houses and that was super empowering for us at the farm.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:24:14):**  The animal houses are always an issue because you build them and you don't know exactly how they're supposed to be and if they're in the right place and you always end up knocking them down and building them again.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:24:23):**  It's just like you have to be flexible with that and we're always looking how to reuse materials and I don't know for some reason we always think wood and some bamboo and I don't know.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:24:32):**  But since the first course we've now built like three different types of wattle and daub or baja rec houses all A-frame style all using split bamboo all from the farm.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:24:45):**  So it's pretty much 100% from the farm where recycled materials they cost us nothing but labor.  
**[0:24:50-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:24:50):**  So at the farm level the natural building has already had like a sweet impact just even on the super functionality that they don't have to look great they just have to work and they're actually perfect for animals.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:25:00):**  It's amazing you know so that alone was super cool.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:25:06):**  And as we build small infrastructure expansions on the farm having the natural building courses and the tools at hand is awesome.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:25:16):**  But largely the vision of the bamboo is to host groups is to host groups.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:25:24):**  I don't want night to night people I don't want anything I want groups that come for a week or two weeks that eat all their meals there and that have a super deep rich transformational experience you know that they learn something that they take somewhere with them.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:25:38):**  And so the bamboo has a vision of hosting 40 weeks of groups a year and permaculture fills already about 14 of them.  
**[0:25:55-0:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:25:55):**  So we have about 36 no 26 weeks left and when I met Liz she you know the bamboo is a perfect example of natural building the farm is a perfect playground and it just seemed like hey we can offer a couple courses a year and the farm can kind of incubate them at the beginning.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:26:15):**  And the bamboo benefits by hosting everyone and we're really good at that and it adds a nice touch and then we hopefully will.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:26:25):**  The idea I think in the future is that the natural building will be done on local people's lands or on basically anywhere in soon enough that will that right now the past two projects have taken place on the farm but the goal I think in the future is like as we get more set up and we know what tools we need what we have the idea would be like.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:26:42):**  What we do a couple of year and we try to do some things that benefit like more people than just the farm you know absolutely branch out a little bit and expand it throughout the community.  
**[0:26:52-0:27:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:26:52):**  That's fantastic. So you also teach the full permaculture design curriculum here on the farm and also take on apprentices who stay on longer and learn more hands on permaculture work.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:27:03):**  What are some of the most important lessons and concepts that you try to emphasize to the students who come here forget good and bad.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:27:12):**  What do you mean by that. There's no good there's no bad. Okay. Yeah that's pretty much it. Like my biggest newest my newest biggest advice.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:27:20):**  But my first thing I used to say I eat animals I I think our farm functions really well with animals on it but I don't think it's absolutely necessary that animals be involved in permaculture designs and not here to convince anyone to be a meat eater or even to have animals in their houses or in their on their homesteads.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:27:40):**  I really have no motivation to convince anyone of anything when I teach right.  
**[0:27:47-0:28:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:27:47):**  The only thing that I say if there's one message is that the dominant Western culture these days sends this message to everyone that humans are bad for the planet.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:28:03):**  You know environmentalism is anti human. It hates humans. It says you know humans destroy the planet. So let's fence off this whole area and and conserve this forest so that humans don't destroy it.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:28:18):**  But a forest without people is also quite depressing and depressed you know. And then that same mentality that says we have to conserve and restrict this because humans otherwise will destroy it.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:28:28):**  It also admits that it's OK that humans destroy all of this over here. Right. So you think if you poop somewhere it's not going to mess up somewhere else.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:28:37):**  And I think the whole environmental movement hates humans. It says that humans are bad and they're going to destroy the planet. My only message the only thing I want to convince people is that that is not true.  
**[0:28:47-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:28:47):**  That humans can be bad for the planet but they can also be amazingly beneficial and enriching and diversifying and beautifying of the planet that we have a true ecological role and ecological function to play.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:29:02):**  What is it. I don't know. I have some ideas. I would maybe think about that. But but basically that's the one message I would really say being like that we are we can be great for the planet. That would be my big one.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:29:17):**  I completely agree with that. Now in nearly a decade of living and farming a lot of that in this community here in Guatemala what have you been what have been some of the most important lessons that you've learned yourself in that time.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:29:38):**  First thing that comes to mind is listen just listen listen to people and ask the right questions. Right. If you think you know something you probably are wrong.  
**[0:29:53-0:29:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:29:53):**  So keep an open mind to what the environment is telling you. Sure.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:29:59):**  And that everything is true.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:30:02):**  From a different perspective.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:30:04):**  Partly yeah definitely.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:30:06):**  Very cool. Now for those people out there who are just getting started developing land into a permaculture site. What advice would you give them on what steps to prioritize and where to put their energies first.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:30:18):**  There's a saying that when you move on to a site that you're going to design you shouldn't do anything at all for a year. And that's everywhere you go to learn permaculture they'll say that I was just teaching an intro course right after the cosmic convergence festival.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:30:37):**  And I was co-teaching with a facilitator from Israel he studied in Israel he teaches in Israel he's like pretty much is almost exclusively his permaculture experiences the Middle East.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:30:48):**  And he said the same exact thing when you move on to a piece of land observe it for a year and do nothing.  
**[0:30:55-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:30:55):**  It's really hard for a lot of us in our mentality to just let's do this let's do that.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:31:01):**  So I think couple that with with the idea that you can try everything if you know it's going to be very small and with the extent with the intention of just learning.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:31:11):**  Now so much building something that's going to last for a long time. And what I would say is in that first year. Observe don't build anything big.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:31:19):**  Observe all the movements of water and sun and wind and everything like that animals and plants and soil.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:31:25):**  But you can do three things in the first year you can make a nursery you can make a plant nursery flatten a piece of ground.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:31:33):**  Start planting plants in bags because you can keep plants alive in a nursery for a year no problem even if you have to move them up to bigger pots and then they're mobile and after a year of observation.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:31:42):**  You have a shit ton of plants you can boom bomb your land you know. So that's one thing is make a plant nursery and try a bunch of stuff you're going to learn a shit ton in that nursery.  
**[0:31:50-0:32:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:31:50):**  Second thing I would say you do is haul carbon bring in carbon bring in as much carbon as you can bring in wood shavings wood chips straw hay grass doesn't matter what.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:32:00):**  Bring it on. Even if you have to move it later you're not sure where to put it just get it on there you won't regret that.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:32:05):**  The third thing I would say to do is probably make a vegetable garden.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:32:09):**  Especially if you're living there because in one year my back garden I started February 24th is now December is now January 6th hasn't even been a year and I've eaten so much stuff out of it.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:32:19):**  The other thing you would be be good to note to yourself is that you might observe that that's the worst place to put the vegetable garden or that's the best place to put the vegetable garden but it's a better place for the house or etc etc.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:32:30):**  So be nimble if you do any development in that first year be ready to change it.  
**[0:32:37-0:32:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:32:37):**  That's some fantastic advice I appreciate that. Now for those people who want to learn more about your farm and all the courses and volunteering opportunities that you offer where can they find you and what's the best way to get in touch?

**[0:33:14-0:33:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:33:14):**  Fantastic and I know you've got a little incentive for people who write blogs as well.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:33:18):**  Want to talk about that?  
**[0:33:19-0:33:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:33:19):**  Yeah basically we the original idea came out of this thing like we get a lot of people that come for a month like it's a common stay like they want to spend four weeks on the farm.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:33:28):**  So my idea was like if someone's in the state for like at least a week or two it would be great to capture their experiences.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:33:35):**  So my original idea was like if you come and stay for a week we have a form on our website where you can upload three photos and like you know the blog that's like a minimum of 250 words and a maximum of a thousand and you're required to put like 10 tags in.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:33:51):**  So it's about something on the farm and I encourage people to get beyond this is what soon as like in my first day on the farm more like find something that grabs your attention.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:33:59):**  Well I didn't know turmeric grows here let's learn more about turmeric and then you write a blog. So like get get stuff that's like kind of interesting get some pictures up there and then basically the idea is we would create it into a blog post and then you would share it on your Facebook page and every time you do that you get like a free night and all your meals that day for free so you can do one a week and you get a night with free meals per week to do it.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:34:21):**  It was just like the idea to like people are usually taking pictures anyway and a lot of people are even capturing their thoughts in journals so why not share it with people in a way to build our social media hasn't quite worked like that but it has attracted a fair amount of like somewhat recognized bloggers and then we do the same thing you write an article you know you get a night free and your three meals.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-005-shad-qudsi/#t=0:34:41):**  Fantastic that's an awesome incentive well Shad thank you so much for taking time today it's been a real pleasure.

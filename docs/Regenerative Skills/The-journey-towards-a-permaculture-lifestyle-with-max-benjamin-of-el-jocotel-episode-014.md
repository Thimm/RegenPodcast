### Regenerative Skills  (Mon, 17 Apr 2017 14:11:35)
**[0:00:00-0:00:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to this episode of The Abundant Edge.  
**[0:00:04-0:00:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:00:04):**  I'm your host Oliver Gaucher and this is the podcast all about the worlds of permaculture,  
**[0:00:08-0:00:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:00:08):**  natural building and regenerative living.  
**[0:00:10-0:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:00:10):**  I have a fantastic interview for you today, so let's jump right on in.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:00:25):**  Now my guest today is another good friend of mine by the name of Max Benjamin, who lives  
**[0:00:29-0:00:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:00:29):**  close by here in Sununna, Guatemala.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:00:32):**  Max is also the owner of El Jocotel, a small permaculture farm and guest house here on  
**[0:00:37-0:00:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:00:37):**  Lake Atitlan.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:00:39):**  Max is originally from Springfield, Massachusetts and studied mechanical engineering at the  
**[0:00:43-0:00:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:00:43):**  University of Rochester, which led him to work on draw bridges, jet engines, at a bubble  
**[0:00:48-0:00:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:00:48):**  wrap company and he even taught one year of high school physics.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:00:53):**  In the last three years Max has moved to Guatemala and set out to build his very own permaculture  
**[0:00:57-0:01:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:00:57):**  farm and sustainable business.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:01:00):**  Now the main reason why I asked Max to share his experiences and stories on this podcast  
**[0:01:05-0:01:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:01:05):**  is because he's a fantastic example of where many of my listeners are in their own process  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:01:10):**  of transitioning to a permaculture or regenerative lifestyle.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:01:14):**  And though his own experiences and circumstances might be completely different from your own,  
**[0:01:19-0:01:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:01:19):**  I think you'll find that many of the challenges he's having at the moment will resonate and  
**[0:01:24-0:01:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:01:24):**  that some of the solutions that we talk about could also apply to your own path towards  
**[0:01:28-0:01:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:01:28):**  the lifestyle and goals that many of you are reaching for.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:01:32):**  I think that a lot of you will take comfort in knowing that there are many people like  
**[0:01:36-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:01:36):**  you making big steps towards positive change and more holistically healthy lifestyles.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:01:42):**  And though you might not be exactly where you want to be right now, there are some very  
**[0:01:46-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:01:46):**  simple and practical steps that everyone can take to keep moving forward in the right direction.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:01:52):**  So without further ado, here's my buddy Max.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:01:54):**  Max, thank you so much for taking time today.  
**[0:01:56-0:01:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:01:56):**  I really appreciate you being here.  
**[0:01:58-0:01:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:01:58):**  Thanks Oliver, thanks for coming up.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:01:59):**  I say being here, but I'm actually at your place with a fantastic view of the valley  
**[0:02:04-0:02:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:02:04):**  below us here in Sununag, Guatemala and the Lake Atitlan over to the corner here.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:02:11):**  I'll actually post a picture because this is one of the best views I've ever had while  
**[0:02:14-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:02:14):**  recording an episode.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:02:15):**  So hey, let's jump right in.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:02:17):**  Talk to me a little bit about how you got started here.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:02:20):**  You've been here now for just over three years?  
**[0:02:22-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:02:22):**  Right, about three and a half years.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:02:24):**  I came here as a backpacker just looking to have a long trip through Latin America.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:02:32):**  But Lake Atitlan was the first place I came to and stayed for six weeks at the Yoga Forest  
**[0:02:39-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:02:39):**  as a permaculture volunteer.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:02:43):**  And I met, happened to be Charlie Rendall, who I think is on your show.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:02:47):**  Yeah, he was my mentor.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:02:48):**  I actually came here first to intern with him because he's a bamboo specialist.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:02:53):**  He's very well appreciated around here on the lake, huge resource.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:02:56):**  Yep, he helped, he came and looked at this land and helped me kind of feel okay about  
**[0:03:01-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:03:01):**  buying the place here.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:03:03):**  So after being at the Yoga Forest and seeing what foreigners were doing here, I thought  
**[0:03:10-0:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:03:10):**  I could build up my own project.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:03:14):**  And over the last three years, what have been sort of the main projects and enterprises  
**[0:03:19-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:03:19):**  that you've built into the land that you have here?  
**[0:03:23-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:03:23):**  Well I just, I started taking cuttings and starters of pretty much every plant I could  
**[0:03:29-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:03:29):**  get my hands on.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:03:31):**  And through that process learning how to propagate plants.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:03:34):**  So just trying to build nice gardens, which centered around this cabin and grew out.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:03:42):**  So I started with this cabin and a composting toilet, which was a design I copied.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:03:47):**  It works great and it's easy.  
**[0:03:51-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:03:51):**  And eventually got into a batch of eight egg hens and that's grown into 36 and now we're  
**[0:04:00-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:04:00):**  raising meat.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:04:01):**  So we do a rental.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:04:04):**  We'd like to do more rentals in the future, but once we have more space, we do the rental  
**[0:04:10-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:04:10):**  and the chickens and the eggs in the gardens and I'm doing a fermentation kombucha that  
**[0:04:20-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:04:20):**  is sold to six or seven clients around the lake.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:04:25):**  I think that's about it for now.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:04:27):**  We're looking for more hospitality and more production of herbs and lettuces and fruit.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:04:36):**  Well so I know you're here for the long haul and though you've got quite a few projects  
**[0:04:39-0:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:04:39):**  already established, tell me a little bit about your vision for the future and what  
**[0:04:43-0:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:04:43):**  else you want to bring in to both the land and some of the business practices that you're  
**[0:04:50-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:04:50):**  integrating in with the community.  
**[0:04:52-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:04:52):**  Great I think what's so nice about hosting people here is that they get a taste of sort  
**[0:05:01-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:05:01):**  of simplicity of living up here where it's quiet.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:05:04):**  You have to walk up here and it's kind of therapeutic just in that alone just by arriving  
**[0:05:10-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:05:10):**  here.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:05:11):**  So if we could share that with more people, that would be cool.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:05:15):**  I teach with Atitlan Organics in the permaculture workshops and bring groups up here to study  
**[0:05:22-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:05:22):**  how to read the contour of the land and I'm happy to continue that and maybe bring in  
**[0:05:27-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:05:27):**  my own set of students to keep teaching the permaculture.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:05:34):**  And with this land I think of this as kind of like a demo farm or like a hobby garden  
**[0:05:39-0:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:05:39):**  where we have plenty of space to test a lot of things but maybe not to be a production  
**[0:05:45-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:05:45):**  that supports us by itself.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:05:47):**  So sometimes local people come here and one young guy, he's about 22, is thinking about  
**[0:05:54-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:05:54):**  they've already begun to do eggs and they want to expand and have more of an integrated  
**[0:06:02-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:06:02):**  system with eggs and compost and fruit trees and helping locals start in that in a nice  
**[0:06:11-0:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:06:11):**  kind of permaculture based sustainable regenerative systems is exciting.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:06:16):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:06:17):**  Now I know that there are a lot of differences in both advantages and disadvantages with  
**[0:06:22-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:06:22):**  working in very undeveloped, very rural areas in well fairly undeveloped countries in the  
**[0:06:28-0:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:06:28):**  areas where we're at here in Guatemala.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:06:31):**  I know like one example would be in the United States to sell eggs you would need to get  
**[0:06:35-0:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:06:35):**  a permit and a facility in order to be a licensed packager of those products.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:06:39):**  Whereas here those are the types of hoops you don't have to jump through.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:06:42):**  But on the other hand the distribution networks aren't there and a lot of the return that  
**[0:06:49-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:06:49):**  you could expect for products like that is going to be a lot lower.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:06:52):**  What are some other things that need to be taken into account when getting into farming  
**[0:06:57-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:06:57):**  enterprises in a country like this?  
**[0:07:01-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:07:01):**  Okay there's one thing is I think of back in the States there always seems to be a lot  
**[0:07:06-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:07:06):**  of a lot of junk around stuff people are giving away that could be really useful for you could  
**[0:07:12-0:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:07:12):**  probably easily easily build a chicken house for free or you could build a greenhouse with  
**[0:07:17-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:07:17):**  used windows or something like that.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:07:19):**  But here we get almost nothing.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:07:21):**  Even if it's free for me in another village I've got a haul of back here and then walk  
**[0:07:26-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:07:26):**  it up the hill and probably hire labor.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:07:29):**  So we get almost nothing extra.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:07:33):**  Nothing that there's no waste stream to tap into here.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:07:36):**  That's right.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:07:37):**  Right.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:07:39):**  So we have to do everything we have to consider very carefully all the materials that we're  
**[0:07:43-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:07:43):**  going to bring back for a project or what we can source from the mountainside.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:07:49):**  So that's something that's a little different.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:07:51):**  There's no pickup truck here to throw in carbon or hay or dry leaves or anything.  
**[0:07:56-0:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:07:56):**  And even if there was there's not close access here either.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:07:59):**  Where you are on the side of this slope you're not going to be able to get any kind of vehicle  
**[0:08:03-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:08:03):**  for easy transportation of materials.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:08:06):**  Everything gets walked up by foot isn't that right?  
**[0:08:08-0:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:08:08):**  That's right.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:08:09):**  About 10 minutes minimum.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:08:11):**  That's if you're not carrying anything.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:08:12):**  And it's a steep slope as well.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:08:14):**  So those things really need to get factored in.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:08:16):**  What are some other considerations?  
**[0:08:18-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:08:18):**  I think one you know I actually get a good price for my eggs.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:08:21):**  It's like it would be the equivalent of like a three dollar dozen which is it's kind of  
**[0:08:26-0:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:08:26):**  expensive around here even though you're getting such a better egg.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:08:32):**  But I think in the same sense as a farm back home that wants to sort of maximize what they're  
**[0:08:37-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:08:37):**  getting you have to.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:08:38):**  Marketing is pretty important.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:08:40):**  We are pretty small scale so I can sell out of eggs and I can as many chickens as I'll  
**[0:08:45-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:08:45):**  raise I'll probably sell out pretty quickly.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:08:47):**  But it does take it does take people aren't banging down my door I got to go find good  
**[0:08:52-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:08:52):**  business.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:08:57):**  You know we farm the mountainside it's not I think a lot of people think a farm is a  
**[0:09:01-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:09:01):**  big flat space and a tractor but this is totally different.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:09:05):**  You know we're hands on and polyculture on the hillside with microclimates.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:09:13):**  So we just try to be we try to be diverse but we're this is really sort of a test farm.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:09:21):**  I'm not dedicated all to coffee or all to corn or avocados or anything I'm just trying  
**[0:09:25-0:09:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:09:25):**  to grow kind of one of each.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:09:27):**  And in the period of seeing what produces really well here with little work that we  
**[0:09:31-0:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:09:31):**  actually can eat.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:09:32):**  Well like you said too a lot of what you're doing at this point is still in the experimental  
**[0:09:36-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:09:36):**  stages and you're using the information that you collect over seasons to figure out what  
**[0:09:40-0:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:09:40):**  is going to be the reliable crop for the future or if you're going to try and experiment in  
**[0:09:45-0:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:09:45):**  another way right.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:09:46):**  Yes.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:09:47):**  So how have you planned for the future with the community in mind.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:09:50):**  I know in places like this community is extremely important especially as we're somewhat cut  
**[0:09:55-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:09:55):**  off from a lot of other resources or it you know it takes time for the most part to get  
**[0:10:00-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:10:00):**  out of this town.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:10:01):**  You either have to take a boat or they're small tuk tuk because there's not even a bus  
**[0:10:05-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:10:05):**  service around here.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:10:06):**  So how is your interactions with the community been planned into the future of what you see  
**[0:10:12-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:10:12):**  for this site.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:10:15):**  Yeah I've always you know I've always thought that people were the most important thing.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:10:18):**  So I I try to learn names and talk to people and treat everybody like an individual and  
**[0:10:28-0:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:10:28):**  you know some people are friendly when I go out and I think that's important just that  
**[0:10:32-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:10:32):**  I'm I'm here.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:10:34):**  They see me carrying things up the hill.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:10:37):**  I think that the people are happy to know one of that someone from this village is working  
**[0:10:43-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:10:43):**  here full time that that I'm providing his his employment and I hope to grow that.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:10:52):**  That's always the goal is to get to get the cleaning lady more work and keep keep him  
**[0:10:57-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:10:57):**  working maybe even one day I'd have two guys and I think it's that I try to keep it pretty  
**[0:11:04-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:11:04):**  simple I'm not trying to grow any organizations or anything just just keep keep good ethics  
**[0:11:12-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:11:12):**  here and in the village and I think that that I have great neighbors who support me and  
**[0:11:20-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:11:20):**  and just try to keep that going.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:11:22):**  Sure and so how have you worked with both in in educational capacities and some exchanges  
**[0:11:29-0:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:11:29):**  with the Tietlon Organics.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:11:31):**  And I've interviewed both Shad and Neil from those places and both of us work pretty closely  
**[0:11:36-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:11:36):**  in contact with them.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:11:37):**  They're sort of the cornerstone for foreign interaction with this town because they were  
**[0:11:43-0:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:11:43):**  here first they have the biggest establishment and they work really closely with the community.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:11:47):**  What are some ways that you've worked with them and they've helped to benefit your progress  
**[0:11:51-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:11:51):**  here.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:11:52):**  Oh yeah well Shad has been a big supporter.  
**[0:11:55-0:11:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:11:55):**  You know he had kind of talked me into doing his workshop which I would I knew I was going  
**[0:11:59-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:11:59):**  to do it but that was a big help and then yeah pretty much as soon as you if you study  
**[0:12:05-0:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:12:05):**  a little permaculture you're probably ready to start teaching and you may not be amazing  
**[0:12:10-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:12:10):**  at first but you know a lot of the concepts are really easy to explain.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:12:16):**  So Shad put me in teaching.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:12:20):**  He his involvement with the hotel he's able to decide to buy the kombucha that I made  
**[0:12:26-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:12:26):**  and they were my best customer through this season.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:12:31):**  And he'll offer me a consult.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:12:33):**  It's also kind of the benefit a perk of being buddies with Shad is just that sitting around  
**[0:12:39-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:12:39):**  with him you know he's likes to open up about his ideas and kind of get the inside track  
**[0:12:45-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:12:45):**  of what's going on with Shad like right at this moment and the stuff that he's thinking  
**[0:12:48-0:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:12:48):**  about his latest successes and failures.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:12:53):**  And that's that's he can he can really talk and I just like to shut up and listen to him  
**[0:12:58-0:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:12:58):**  and we get a lot of great stuff.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:13:01):**  He's sort of the one who taught me to a lot of the stuff he said at first would sound  
**[0:13:06-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:13:06):**  backwards but then he would sort of he would explain it and it starts to make sense.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:13:12):**  So is that an answer.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:13:14):**  Yeah no that's fantastic.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:13:15):**  And now I know that there are also some downsides of interactions with the community here.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:13:20):**  Can you explain some of the challenges that you've had for being a foreigner in a very  
**[0:13:24-0:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:13:24):**  tight knit community like this.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:13:26):**  Yeah well we have we have a language barrier.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:13:28):**  I'm here using Spanish as a second language and the local people are speaking Spanish  
**[0:13:32-0:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:13:32):**  as a second language also.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:13:35):**  So there's sometimes a communication barrier you know even with like little kids.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:13:43):**  I live up at the top of the village here and a lot of the older people and kids just don't  
**[0:13:49-0:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:13:49):**  speak any Spanish.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:13:50):**  So so there become these little you know antagonistic interactions I think just because we couldn't  
**[0:13:57-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:13:57):**  talk.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:13:58):**  We have we have no verbal communication.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:14:00):**  So that was a little bit of a little static at first just being a new guy who looks different  
**[0:14:07-0:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:14:07):**  up here walking through and that we can't even talk really.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:14:14):**  And there's no problems like existing in a kind of a poor Guatemalan village of some  
**[0:14:20-0:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:14:20):**  drinking and drug use and petty theft.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:14:23):**  And that's been a small persistent problem here that I'm not used to from back home.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:14:30):**  But you know I like to think of that as kind of a small tax for all the beautiful benefits  
**[0:14:35-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:14:35):**  of living here.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:14:37):**  Like all the all the nice people that exist for every one guy who might come in and steal  
**[0:14:41-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:14:41):**  everything or one kid and the great weather and great soil and everything.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:14:47):**  Of course.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:14:48):**  Now what are some of the main things that you've learned over your three years here  
**[0:14:51-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:14:51):**  and how has it directed your goals for the future?  
**[0:14:59-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:14:59):**  Yeah I think first of all I love the garden.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:15:03):**  I see that as this kind of ever changing project.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:15:07):**  It's like a piece of art that changes over time and as I become accustomed to plants  
**[0:15:13-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:15:13):**  growing and flowers coming out you know now I'm looking more thinking about what plants  
**[0:15:20-0:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:15:20):**  will I really use.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:15:22):**  Not only ones that make me feel good because they look great but like what is medicine  
**[0:15:25-0:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:15:25):**  or what is food and how do I think of this garden in the future.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:15:31):**  Almost thinking of like what's the slowest thing that'll grow.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:15:34):**  That's what I should be thinking about planting.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:15:37):**  I've learned a deal just like we just said kind of thinking about the social sector and  
**[0:15:41-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:15:41):**  my design and thinking through it thinking through a design from if it's business how  
**[0:15:49-0:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:15:49):**  how do I take it to the stage where people actually are ready to give me money how does  
**[0:15:53-0:16:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:15:53):**  it get to the transaction and how to keep it going how to keep this as a business as  
**[0:16:02-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:16:02):**  a sustainable business but where I'm making deals that everybody feels good about you  
**[0:16:07-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:16:07):**  know where we can look each other in the eye and shake hands and everybody's happy and  
**[0:16:12-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:16:12):**  that it stays interesting.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:16:19):**  You've also talked to me in the past about how the relationship with energy here is completely  
**[0:16:24-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:16:24):**  different from in more developed and built up places like the United States or Europe.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:16:30):**  Can you explain how that's affected your lifestyle here?  
**[0:16:36-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:16:36):**  You know it seems like we people are trying to just burn up the fossil fuels as fast as  
**[0:16:40-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:16:40):**  possible and I don't know I like to have this site be you know pulling carbon and putting  
**[0:16:49-0:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:16:49):**  it into the ground take we're doing our part to pull carbon out of the air and put it back  
**[0:16:55-0:17:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:16:55):**  into the ground and and just makes me more conscious of what you know what I'm what I'm  
**[0:17:03-0:17:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:17:03):**  spending money on that's that's that's kind of like fossil fuel based like shipping and  
**[0:17:08-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:17:08):**  transport and some aspects of travel and flying and and you know how we allocate our energy.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:17:16):**  So for the lack of things that normally do a ton of the brunt work that other people  
**[0:17:20-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:17:20):**  spend less time on in developed areas like like we were talking about getting things  
**[0:17:25-0:17:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:17:25):**  transported up here it needs to get done by foot.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:17:27):**  It's the only way to access this property from the road.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:17:32):**  The fact that you can't get machinery on the slope of your land and so all of the farming  
**[0:17:38-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:17:38):**  all the gardening gets done with manual labor.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:17:41):**  And yeah in general the the value added products the processing that you do from the things  
**[0:17:49-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:17:49):**  that come off of this land also all get done by hand kind of gives you a perspective of  
**[0:17:54-0:18:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:17:54):**  how much energy goes into these whether you're fueling a machine to do it or you're paying  
**[0:18:00-0:18:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:18:00):**  a person or feeding a person and how that energy gets transported and the byproducts  
**[0:18:05-0:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:18:05):**  of it as well.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:18:06):**  Yeah that's well put.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:18:08):**  So you're you're currently at an interesting stage because this is only a couple of years  
**[0:18:12-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:18:12):**  old and you have ambitions of taking this into something that is sustainable that can  
**[0:18:17-0:18:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:18:17):**  keep you here on the land all the time.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:18:19):**  But as we talked about the products that you would create from a place like this agricultural  
**[0:18:24-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:18:24):**  products value added products don't fetch the same prices we would be accustomed to  
**[0:18:29-0:18:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:18:29):**  in other countries.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:18:31):**  And so income generation and all the other things that are needed to make this a sustainable  
**[0:18:37-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:18:37):**  plot.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:18:38):**  I know you have those planned out for the future but can you explain a little bit about  
**[0:18:41-0:18:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:18:41):**  where you are currently and some of your ambitions to get to that sustainable point because I  
**[0:18:46-0:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:18:46):**  know a lot of our listeners are somewhere within you know their goals for the future  
**[0:18:52-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:18:52):**  and their situation currently.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:18:54):**  How are you dealing with those dynamics.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:18:56):**  Okay first I work a job at another hotel by the lake about three shifts about 20 hours  
**[0:19:05-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:19:05):**  a week.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:19:06):**  And you know that has perks besides the money I get to go online and connect with people  
**[0:19:11-0:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:19:11):**  and I get to meet new people and I get food down there.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:19:15):**  But I also get enough I make money which helps me pay my local worker and by being able to  
**[0:19:21-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:19:21):**  work in the kitchen and speak English I can you know I have that value and I earn money  
**[0:19:27-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:19:27):**  and I can pay my local guy.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:19:30):**  But ideally you know one day I would give up that job and I would take those 20 hours  
**[0:19:34-0:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:19:34):**  and keep stay here.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:19:37):**  So I'm still working I still work an outside job.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:19:41):**  I make the kombucha which is a nice hobby but I could it's not exactly a farm based  
**[0:19:48-0:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:19:48):**  thing and I could phase that out but it's been a helpful income generator to help me  
**[0:19:55-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:19:55):**  push into other projects like it's paid for some of the chicken infrastructure fencing  
**[0:19:59-0:20:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:19:59):**  and housing.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:20:03):**  So what are some enterprises that you're planning on ramping up in the future in order to bridge  
**[0:20:11-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:20:11):**  that gap that you currently have?  
**[0:20:13-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:20:13):**  A little more of the hospitality just we have a lot of tourists and if I could just put  
**[0:20:18-0:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:20:18):**  people in the rooms here that's an easy way just to have people come stay and sort of  
**[0:20:28-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:20:28):**  either provide their own program of lying in the hammock and reading or being involved  
**[0:20:33-0:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:20:33):**  in one of the local workshops that's going on or if we offer something here just to sort  
**[0:20:40-0:20:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:20:40):**  of bring those dollars into the village.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:20:44):**  I'd like to scale up the meat and the eggs and possibly develop a restaurant sort of  
**[0:20:51-0:20:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:20:51):**  a diverse coffee shop bakery restaurants plant nursery.  
**[0:20:57-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:20:57):**  That's where I want to spend my time is with plants and I think by selling plants and teaching  
**[0:21:01-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:21:01):**  people how to propagate and just making nice plants and moving them out the door is I think  
**[0:21:13-0:21:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:21:13):**  the best way I could kind of merge business and pleasure really by continuing to work  
**[0:21:18-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:21:18):**  with plants.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:21:19):**  Fantastic well I know you and I are going to be working together a lot in the future  
**[0:21:22-0:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:21:22):**  to help make these things happen so I'm really excited about that and you've got a great  
**[0:21:26-0:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:21:26):**  start here.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:21:27):**  Thank you.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:21:28):**  You've done fantastic work in a very short amount of time so I commend you for that.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:21:31):**  So how can people get in touch with you if they want to learn more about your projects  
**[0:21:35-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:21:35):**  at Heatlawn Organics and are interested in renting out this million dollar view that  
**[0:21:39-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:21:39):**  you've got at the top of the hill here?  
**[0:21:41-0:21:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:21:41):**  Right this place is called El Hocotel like the Spanish word Hocotel J-O-C-O-T-E-L. Hocotel  
**[0:21:50-0:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:21:50):**  on Instagram and El Hocotel on Facebook.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:21:54):**  I'm Max Benjamin.  
**[0:21:55-0:21:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:21:55):**  I'm on Facebook also.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:21:58):**  Would that do it?  
**[0:22:00-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:22:00):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:22:01):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:22:02):**  Well thank you so much for taking the time today.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:22:04):**  I look forward to visiting up here again soon.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:22:06):**  This is a really special place that you have and hey I see you around all the time so we'll  
**[0:22:11-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:22:11):**  catch up again real soon.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:22:12):**  Thanks for taking the time Max.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:22:13):**  Sure.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:22:14):**  Thanks Oliver.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:22:15):**  Bye.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:22:16):**  Thanks so much for tuning into the interview.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:22:18):**  Now before I go I want to try out a new segment where I'll answer listeners questions or offer  
**[0:22:23-0:22:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:22:23):**  a tip or a trick each week.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:22:25):**  This first edition I'm going to call Using What You Have.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:22:29):**  So I recently was speaking to a friend of mine who had just come back from a natural  
**[0:22:32-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:22:32):**  building presentation by a man who specialized in adobe building.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:22:36):**  Now at the conference the guy was talking about how he was struggling to find good clay  
**[0:22:40-0:22:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:22:40):**  soil on his land because the site that he was building on was covered in really rocky  
**[0:22:45-0:22:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:22:45):**  soil.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:22:47):**  Now at face value this seems like a pretty logical setback.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:22:50):**  Rocky soil isn't suitable for making an adobe mix but if you take a step back this is the  
**[0:22:55-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:22:55):**  perfect example of something that is often said in permaculture circles, namely the problem  
**[0:23:00-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:23:00):**  is the solution.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:23:02):**  Now in this case if the guy was more open to other options he would see that having  
**[0:23:07-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:23:07):**  a ton of rocks on this site was a blessing rather than a setback.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:23:11):**  Now in this case the locals in town where we live here in the mountains of Guatemala  
**[0:23:15-0:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:23:15):**  use stones for most of their construction and while there are certainly adobe buildings  
**[0:23:19-0:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:23:19):**  and plenty of cement ones too, being open minded to what you have in abundance rather  
**[0:23:24-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:23:24):**  than being married to the idea that your building be made of one material that you're excited  
**[0:23:28-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:23:28):**  about or that you specialized in but would also have to be imported will open you to  
**[0:23:34-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:23:34):**  many more regenerative possibilities.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:23:37):**  Now for example I started off a natural building intending to specialize in cob construction.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:23:42):**  That was the material that first really inspired me and what I focused on for the first handful  
**[0:23:46-0:23:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:23:46):**  of months of my apprenticeship.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:23:48):**  But as I started the travel portion of my learning I quickly met teachers who advised  
**[0:23:52-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:23:52):**  me to really research the place and the site where I was intending to build to see what  
**[0:23:57-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:23:57):**  would be best suited for both the land, the climate, and the people who would use the  
**[0:24:01-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:24:01):**  building.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:24:02):**  There are a lot of other criteria which I go over in a few of the articles on the website  
**[0:24:06-0:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:24:06):**  but the point is that if you go into a place or a project with an agenda rather than an  
**[0:24:10-0:24:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:24:10):**  open mind, more often than not you'll end up fighting the land, the people, or even  
**[0:24:15-0:24:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:24:15):**  yourself in order to make your conditions match your agenda.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:24:20):**  Of course this applies to so many things other than building.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:24:23):**  If you're intent on growing a certain crop that just isn't suited for your climate or  
**[0:24:27-0:24:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:24:27):**  your land you'll have a huge uphill battle trying to make it grow.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:24:31):**  But if you select species that are bred and adapted for those factors you'll find you  
**[0:24:35-0:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:24:35):**  barely have to do any maintenance and they'll just take care of themselves.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:24:39):**  Now before I get a whole bunch of listener mail I know that you can grow things out of  
**[0:24:43-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:24:43):**  their specified climate or amend the landscape and create microclimates but again this is  
**[0:24:50-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:24:50):**  a good example of where you have to do a lot of amendments and a lot of extra work whereas  
**[0:24:54-0:25:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:24:54):**  if you select species or breeds that are acclimatized or specially bred for your conditions no one's  
**[0:25:01-0:25:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:25:01):**  going to doubt that it's just so much easier to make them grow.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:25:05):**  So the point is keep an open mind and be flexible about the process and the method of how you  
**[0:25:10-0:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:25:10):**  achieve your goals.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:25:12):**  You may just find that you'll have success in ways that you could never have imagined  
**[0:25:16-0:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-014-max-benjamin/#t=0:25:16):**  just by being flexible to what your environment is already offering you.

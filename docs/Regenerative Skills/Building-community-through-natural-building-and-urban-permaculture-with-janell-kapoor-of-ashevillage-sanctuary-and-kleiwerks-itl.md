### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 03 Mar 2017 12:42:32)
**[0:00:00-0:00:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to another episode of The Abundant Edge, the podcast all about the worlds  
**[0:00:04-0:00:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:00:04):**  of natural building, permaculture, and regenerative living.  
**[0:00:08-0:00:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:00:08):**  I'm your host Oliver Gaucher.  
**[0:00:10-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:00:10):**  I've got another fantastic guest to interview today and a lot of information to cover, so  
**[0:00:14-0:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:00:14):**  let's jump right on in.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:00:25):**  In this interview I had the pleasure of speaking with Janelle Kapoor, the founder of both Clayworks  
**[0:00:29-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:00:29):**  International and the Ash Village Institute and Sanctuary.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:00:33):**  Janelle has been teaching natural building workshops since 1997 all over the world and  
**[0:00:37-0:00:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:00:37):**  founded Clayworks International in 2004.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:00:41):**  She also ran some of the first earthen building trainings in Thailand, Argentina, and Turkey.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:00:46):**  Since 2006 she has been renovating and building the site of the Ash Village Institute by reclaiming  
**[0:00:52-0:00:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:00:52):**  materials from the waste stream and using natural materials from the site.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:00:56):**  Since then, Ash Village has become a model ecological and environmental learning center  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:01:00):**  and demonstration site that offers a wide range of regenerative living skills, courses,  
**[0:01:05-0:01:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:01:05):**  and workshops.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:01:07):**  In this interview Janelle talks about the mission and intent behind Ash Village, how  
**[0:01:11-0:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:01:11):**  she found ways to design systems that bring humans and nature together, her incredible  
**[0:01:16-0:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:01:16):**  work empowering and working with women, and much more.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:01:20):**  Janelle has been one of my biggest inspirations since I got started in the natural living  
**[0:01:23-0:01:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:01:23):**  world and her experience and insights do not disappoint, so I'll let her take it from  
**[0:01:28-0:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:01:28):**  here.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:01:29):**  Be sure to stay tuned at the end of this episode, I'll give some exclusive information on  
**[0:01:33-0:01:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:01:33):**  new workshops coming up.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:01:36):**  And now here's Janelle Kapoor.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:01:39):**  Hello and thank you so much for taking the time today Janelle, it's always a pleasure  
**[0:01:42-0:01:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:01:42):**  to talk to you.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:01:43):**  I have a ton of questions that I'd love to ask so let's jump right on in.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:01:47):**  First of all, how did you first get started in natural building permaculture and community  
**[0:01:51-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:01:51):**  organizing?  
**[0:01:52-0:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:01:52):**  After high school I knew that what I wanted to be part of in the world was not something  
**[0:02:00-0:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:02:00):**  I would find in a college environment, so I ended up traveling and participating in  
**[0:02:07-0:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:02:07):**  internships hands-on and really wanting to engage directly and learn directly.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:02:14):**  And so I ended up in Tennessee where Yonso Evans of Cobb Cottage company led his first  
**[0:02:24-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:02:24):**  Earthen...or first Cobb workshop on the eastern part of the country.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:02:30):**  And at the time Janine Bjornson was his apprentice and it was her first teaching gig, they co-taught.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:02:38):**  And I was with the site where the building was going to be happening and so I was part  
**[0:02:43-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:02:43):**  of the design team and host team and there were a few things that really stood out to  
**[0:02:49-0:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:02:49):**  me.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:02:50):**  So this was the first time I engaged with Earthen building and it was just clear from  
**[0:02:55-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:02:55):**  the very get-go, literally even before I got in the mud, but I was always fascinated by  
**[0:03:00-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:03:00):**  architecture and but the moment I got into the mud it was just, I mean, it was meant  
**[0:03:07-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:03:07):**  to be.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:03:08):**  I knew I was still pretty, I think I was 22 at the time, I wanted to become a master of  
**[0:03:16-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:03:16):**  something.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:03:17):**  There was this craving in me to find my path having already traveled and dabbled in a lot  
**[0:03:24-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:03:24):**  of things and having a lot of passion, but really wanting to take on something that would  
**[0:03:30-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:03:30):**  become my craft.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:03:32):**  And so when I got in the mud and I was there, I was dreaming every night that I was like  
**[0:03:36-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:03:36):**  different mud formations, mud bridges, mud buildings, my body was the mud.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:03:44):**  I had past like recalls and yachts.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:03:48):**  We were both big personalities in the workshop.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:03:52):**  He always kicked me out and we laughed about it now, but at one point I think I just annoyed  
**[0:03:57-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:03:57):**  him enough.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:03:58):**  He was like, go in the woods and find some mud.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:04:01):**  He just wanted to...  
**[0:04:03-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:04:03):**  So I went and I found this incredible new mud in the like orange banks and the Tennessee  
**[0:04:15-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:04:15):**  Creek.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:04:16):**  It's pretty rare, like it was just deposited, but somehow I just needed to go to...  
**[0:04:22-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:04:22):**  Anyway, all to say that I think for me the mud and building with mud is something that  
**[0:04:28-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:04:28):**  I've known.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:04:30):**  I mean I've probably done it for a lifetime and just recently I was working on a project  
**[0:04:37-0:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:04:37):**  and I actually am not doing so much earth and building anymore, but it's just everything  
**[0:04:43-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:04:43):**  in me knows exactly what to do.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:04:45):**  I feel it.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:04:46):**  It's like this very deep intuitive understanding of how to work with earth and materials.  
**[0:04:53-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:04:53):**  And yeah, I think that's one of my favorite parts of building with mud is that intuitive  
**[0:05:02-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:05:02):**  sensibility and that it explains something in me that is the visionary that wants to  
**[0:05:11-0:05:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:05:11):**  keep stretching the envelope and seeing what I can do with new things that I can do with  
**[0:05:18-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:05:18):**  the mud that I haven't done before, you know, trying out and experimenting.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:05:23):**  So...  
**[0:05:24-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:05:24):**  You can definitely relate to that too.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:05:27):**  Yeah.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:05:28):**  You know, I mean people...  
**[0:05:30-0:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:05:30):**  I mean I think it's something that so many of us have a deep profound connection to and  
**[0:05:37-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:05:37):**  it seems to open up channels of connection for people to a deeper connection with the  
**[0:05:46-0:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:05:46):**  earth and with ourselves, you know, and that was one of the things that I appreciated so  
**[0:05:52-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:05:52):**  much about using natural building as a community organizing tool.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:05:58):**  And yeah, as far as the PDC, the Permaculture Peace, back in 1997 that same internship in  
**[0:06:07-0:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:06:07):**  Tennessee I participated in a course with a number of teachers from the Southeast and  
**[0:06:14-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:06:14):**  that's where I got turned on to permaculture and I recognized that my heart song, my passion  
**[0:06:21-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:06:21):**  at the time, and my specialty, what was coming to me as my very clear, strong skill set was  
**[0:06:28-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:06:28):**  in natural building and that became my core focus.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:06:33):**  That and I would also say I'm very much a foodie and food is medicine and fermentation  
**[0:06:38-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:06:38):**  and that's also another arena.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:06:42):**  But anyway, permaculture is sort of the big umbrella and since then I organized many,  
**[0:06:49-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:06:49):**  many programs around permaculture, but that was...  
**[0:06:54-0:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:06:54):**  That's where I got started in all of it and actually before that I was looking at  
**[0:07:00-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:07:00):**  another community up in Wisconsin and we had dabbled in all of those things.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:07:05):**  So my ears were wet to knowing about it, but it was really back in 97 that I got to dive  
**[0:07:13-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:07:13):**  in more deeply and it's something I recommend for folks who want to learn is if you're  
**[0:07:19-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:07:19):**  at an age or a time in your life where you can explore and go beyond just a long workshop,  
**[0:07:29-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:07:29):**  it's really valuable to have the time to delve in more deeply and be on a slide for  
**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:07:35):**  a longer period of time and get to go through the stages of different parts of a building  
**[0:07:40-0:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:07:40):**  process.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:07:43):**  And certainly if all you can do is a week or a weekend, it's also really helpful to  
**[0:07:48-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:07:48):**  just get a taste.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:07:50):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:07:51):**  Sure.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:07:52):**  I really agree with that.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:07:53):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:07:54):**  And I've done different workshops and volunteer opportunities all around the world and it  
**[0:07:59-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:07:59):**  really helps to get what you learn from the class to sink in and make practical sense.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:08:04):**  I agree.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:08:05):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:08:06):**  Good.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:08:07):**  Now, I know you've shifted gears in the last couple of years, but you used to be the  
**[0:08:12-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:08:12):**  founding director of Clayworks International and through them you led tons of natural building  
**[0:08:18-0:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:08:18):**  projects and workshops all around the world.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:08:20):**  What are the most important aspects of natural building that you focused on in your training  
**[0:08:25-0:08:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:08:25):**  and how has it affected the communities that you've worked with?  
**[0:08:29-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:08:29):**  Oh, I love your question.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:08:31):**  Thank you.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:08:32):**  Yeah, it's great.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:08:33):**  I was really engaged for a long time in the natural building world and still a dear to  
**[0:08:41-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:08:41):**  my heart.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:08:42):**  And actually last year we had a gathering in New Mexico of a lot of the veteran, longtime  
**[0:08:51-0:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:08:51):**  early folks from the natural building world and gathered and there were, I think, about  
**[0:08:56-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:08:56):**  150 of us for a week.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:08:58):**  And it was really this beautiful family reunion experience and it's so wonderful to be with  
**[0:09:06-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:09:06):**  all the old timers.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:09:08):**  And anyway, yeah, my favorite aspect...  
**[0:09:11-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:09:11):**  That's what you asked about.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:09:13):**  What was most significant and favorite aspects to teaching internationally and what felt  
**[0:09:19-0:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:09:19):**  important in the communities I was working with?  
**[0:09:22-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:09:22):**  That's what you were asking?  
**[0:09:25-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:09:25):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:09:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:09:27):**  And I was like, oh, gosh, there's lots of ways to talk about that.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:09:33):**  When I felt that I had accomplished what I was setting out to do is when the people I  
**[0:09:43-0:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:09:43):**  was working with in the training went on to build their own projects or follow their personal  
**[0:09:51-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:09:51):**  vision and dream for how they wanted to be living in sustainable ways and where their  
**[0:10:02-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:10:02):**  confidence and their self-empowerment process really took hold and they were activated such  
**[0:10:11-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:10:11):**  that they went for it.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:10:13):**  And oftentimes really shifting gears in their personal lives from perhaps an office job  
**[0:10:20-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:10:20):**  or being an architect in the middle of the city of Bangkok to becoming a pioneering earth  
**[0:10:28-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:10:28):**  and building organizer in Thailand is one example or my dear friends in Argentina, Diego,  
**[0:10:36-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:10:36):**  and Natalia, they had worked, I think it was something like 17 years in an office building  
**[0:10:44-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:10:44):**  and it was the first time they'd taken off for two weeks and they came down to Catagonia.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:10:49):**  This is back in 2000...  
**[0:10:51-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:10:51):**  It was in 2004, I think, and they came and I guess I learned later it was their first  
**[0:10:59-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:10:59):**  time off.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:11:00):**  It's, you know, I mean years and years.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:11:04):**  They were just like floored and they put their jobs and then they got land and they started  
**[0:11:11-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:11:11):**  an educational center.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:11:13):**  So, for me that was the best story and the intention was to design myself out of the  
**[0:11:20-0:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:11:20):**  system as quickly as possible that the goal was to share the skills in such a way that  
**[0:11:27-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:11:27):**  people could take it and run with it and become part of the leadership team in their country  
**[0:11:33-0:11:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:11:33):**  for teaching and sharing with others.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:11:36):**  So, that was the thing that moved me the most.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:11:41):**  And I think another thing for me that touches me when I think of people who are engaging  
**[0:11:49-0:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:11:49):**  in natural building, especially for the first time and in the ways that we ran our training,  
**[0:11:55-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:11:55):**  which certainly were technical and we were very, very focused on the project.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:12:00):**  I can hear your dog there.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:12:03):**  Yeah, but there was also an emphasis on the community aspect and the engagement of spirit  
**[0:12:11-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:12:11):**  and our spirit and our connection with the natural world and especially with recognizing  
**[0:12:19-0:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:12:19):**  that we are part of nature, that we as humans, as Earthlings are not separate and we have  
**[0:12:27-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:12:27):**  this whole illusion of separation.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:12:31):**  And what was so powerful in the work that I was doing was missing this connecting of  
**[0:12:42-0:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:12:42):**  dots and the opening or reconnection of the soul, reconnection of people's heart and  
**[0:12:51-0:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:12:51):**  their path and their journey in this lifetime to being part of a much larger cycle of...and  
**[0:13:01-0:13:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:13:01):**  connections and web of life.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:13:03):**  And that...  
**[0:13:04-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:13:04):**  I think that was and is for me the most important aspect of natural building is that it's  
**[0:13:12-0:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:13:12):**  a gateway into how we can reconnect and redesign our lives to be part of nature, part of the  
**[0:13:21-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:13:21):**  natural order of things.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:13:24):**  And yeah, I mean that really is...  
**[0:13:27-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:13:27):**  For me, it's most important.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:13:31):**  And I could frankly care less about putting more buildings on the planet, but to build  
**[0:13:38-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:13:38):**  with Earth in a way that incorporates the ancient and the future through the engagement  
**[0:13:46-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:13:46):**  of our free will as humans of how we choose to be part of the healing of the planet right  
**[0:13:53-0:14:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:13:53):**  now and natural building really is a beautiful, beautiful reconnective tool.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:14:01):**  So that was a big part of the work for me and watching that land for people, watching  
**[0:14:08-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:14:08):**  that really take hold in the lives of those who were participating was profound.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:14:17):**  And I'll just add that it happened on a very internal, personal level for people.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:14:24):**  And then it also happened because we were living together and working together and learning  
**[0:14:29-0:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:14:29):**  together and being in our bodies.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:14:32):**  And so many people, I believe, really missed the opportunity to feel like that they are  
**[0:14:39-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:14:39):**  part of a village, they're part of a larger organism and that they're valued and that  
**[0:14:44-0:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:14:44):**  they're part of a team and that they can see something manifest through the hands of  
**[0:14:52-0:14:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:14:52):**  coming together in community the ways that we did.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:14:54):**  And then we would cook together and eat together and celebrate and sing and, you know, I mean  
**[0:14:59-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:14:59):**  it was just a beautiful time.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:15:01):**  So those are the things that stand out.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:15:08):**  And then along with that is realizing that it is possible for us to live in a way that  
**[0:15:19-0:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:15:19):**  has so much more coherence and sensibility on this planet and that we do have options  
**[0:15:31-0:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:15:31):**  with that work and that they're very eloquent and it's a living poetry if we so choose  
**[0:15:39-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:15:39):**  to be part of that as opposed to the consumer culture that we often find ourselves drowning  
**[0:15:47-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:15:47):**  within that there's these very tangible, practical, grounded ways that we can show  
**[0:15:56-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:15:56):**  up and create the world that we know is very possible.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:16:05):**  But that was...  
**[0:16:06-0:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:16:06):**  Just the practicality is meaningful and it took all the part of me that's visionary  
**[0:16:15-0:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:16:15):**  and big picture and really grounded and has an important...  
**[0:16:29-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:16:29):**  I feel there's one other piece that I'd like to name and I'm trying to kind of put  
**[0:16:43-0:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:16:43):**  this.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:16:44):**  Yeah, I guess it's sort of stems from what I just said, but seeing how activated people  
**[0:16:50-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:16:50):**  got and the networks that grew out of the work that I was doing and that I was doing  
**[0:16:57-0:17:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:16:57):**  with others, you know, I mean wherever I was there were many collaborators and watching  
**[0:17:02-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:17:02):**  how one project could literally turn into a hundred projects which then turned into  
**[0:17:09-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:17:09):**  a thousand and then reached hundreds of thousands of people in Southeast Asia and South America  
**[0:17:16-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:17:16):**  and sort of kind of seeing it as a sort of family tree of sorts where the web of connections,  
**[0:17:25-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:17:25):**  the networks, the lineages of people learning and just how it grew and it's very simple,  
**[0:17:31-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:17:31):**  simple technology in the hands of people who might not otherwise have the means to build  
**[0:17:39-0:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:17:39):**  their own houses or all the ways that it landed in people's lives, getting to watch how  
**[0:17:46-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:17:46):**  that grew particularly in South America and Southeast Asia, Thailand and Argentina.  
**[0:17:54-0:18:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:17:54):**  I was invited to work in those regions and in those countries at times for both of them  
**[0:18:00-0:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:18:00):**  where the economy was tanking and people were, I mean both of them are their own scenarios,  
**[0:18:10-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:18:10):**  but in each case it really, really hit the ground running.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:18:16):**  I mean literally overnight we were watching, especially through the media connections,  
**[0:18:21-0:18:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:18:21):**  the activist networks that we were working with, what I got to see was just the spread  
**[0:18:26-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:18:26):**  of it happening so quickly and how it really became this solution for people that in some  
**[0:18:35-0:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:18:35):**  cases they've saved entire families and villages from being sold into sort of indentured slavery  
**[0:18:43-0:18:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:18:43):**  or factory burger prostitution and I mean that has a profound impact.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:18:50):**  I could probably go on and on just with this one question, but let's keep going.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:18:54):**  No, sure, fair enough.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:18:56):**  I really like the way you put those connections being like a family tree.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:19:00):**  It's one of the things that's inspired me a lot as well, especially with natural building  
**[0:19:04-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:19:04):**  and permaculture.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:19:05):**  A lot of people can trace back to their teachers and the other people that they've influenced  
**[0:19:11-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:19:11):**  and collaborators and it's something that I draw a lot of inspiration from as well.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:19:16):**  Yeah, it's something I know that I wouldn't say it's unique only to the natural building  
**[0:19:23-0:19:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:19:23):**  and permaculture world, but it certainly is an aspect of how we operate in those worlds.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:19:31):**  The more we can share with each other, the more we can inspire and share the secrets  
**[0:19:37-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:19:37):**  of the trade, the more exciting it is for all of us and it's so non-proprietary.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:19:42):**  Yeah, yeah, for sure.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:19:44):**  I agree with that.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:19:46):**  It's just that alone.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:19:48):**  Yeah, it's really very cooperative.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:19:51):**  So here, let's take another little leap forward here.  
**[0:19:55-0:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:19:55):**  So I know you're most involved now with the Ash Village Institute or Ash Village Sanctuary  
**[0:20:00-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:20:00):**  in Asheville, North Carolina.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:20:02):**  Tell me a little bit about the school and how it all got started.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:20:06):**  Yeah, sure.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:20:08):**  And I wanted to, when I mentioned Janine Bjornson, I just wanted to give a shout out to her and  
**[0:20:16-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:20:16):**  to all the women doing natural building.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:20:18):**  I know for me at a young age, having never built anything, having a woman present who  
**[0:20:25-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:20:25):**  was in a leadership position, you know, in a subtle way and also in a not-so-subtle way  
**[0:20:33-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:20:33):**  was something that I needed to see or having her there helped me to see that, sure, I can  
**[0:20:41-0:20:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:20:41):**  do this as well and it gave me confidence and I just wanted to acknowledge that and  
**[0:20:46-0:20:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:20:46):**  I'll probably circle back around that in a little while, but yeah, that was...  
**[0:20:52-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:20:52):**  I wanted to make note of that.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:20:54):**  Of course.  
**[0:20:55-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:20:55):**  And yeah, and my dear Yonto Evans, I love him dearly.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:21:02):**  We really...  
**[0:21:03-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:21:03):**  We became very close friends.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:21:05):**  I know that he had a lot of appreciation for the direction I went in and we became quite  
**[0:21:13-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:21:13):**  close friends, but we still joke about that time, me being such a young rascal, where  
**[0:21:19-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:21:19):**  he kicked me out of the workshop.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:21:21):**  So he couldn't quite kick me out though.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:21:23):**  I was like, you're not kicking me out.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:21:25):**  I'm saying, dude, this is way too good.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:21:28):**  But...  
**[0:21:29-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:21:29):**  I can see how it could go with two very tenacious personalities working together.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:21:34):**  Oh yeah, totally.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:21:35):**  It's totally true.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:21:36):**  I remember one time when he was with me as well.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:21:38):**  Yeah, he's quite a character.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:21:40):**  Oh, he's quite a character.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:21:42):**  And yeah, he also, I mean, you know, he's got, you know, he's Yonto and he's one  
**[0:21:55-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:21:55):**  of the people who has inspired me most and I so appreciate the unique perspective he  
**[0:22:01-0:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:22:01):**  brings and how much he has maintained this very pure relationship with the natural world  
**[0:22:11-0:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:22:11):**  and, you know, of the humans I know, Yonto Evans is truly one of the remarkable human  
**[0:22:17-0:22:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:22:17):**  beings who, and I mean this in the absolute most honorable ways, you know, he lives as  
**[0:22:27-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:22:27):**  if he is one of the animals in the ecosystem of the planet and I just...  
**[0:22:36-0:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:22:36):**  I still, when I think of him, I swoon, I swoon Yonto, you're right here.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:22:41):**  I just adore my dear Yonto.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:22:43):**  So anyway, moving on to Ashlulich Sanctuary.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:22:48):**  Yeah, and we used to call it the Institute, Ashlulich Institute, but the land itself,  
**[0:22:56-0:23:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:22:56):**  which is owned by myself, we started as sort of separate the programming that I was running  
**[0:23:05-0:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:23:05):**  from the land itself and so now that's actually very much become my focus is the sanctuary,  
**[0:23:13-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:23:13):**  which is four acre...  
**[0:23:15-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:23:15):**  Sorry, four properties in Ashlulich and they're all connected.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:23:20):**  They're in a little neighborhood right off of downtown and so it's just literally  
**[0:23:29-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:23:29):**  a stone's throw from downtown, a walking distance, and then we also back 60 acres of  
**[0:23:34-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:23:34):**  wood and we have 1.3 acres and it's becoming a really beautiful hub.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:23:43):**  So I'm 10 years in.  
**[0:23:46-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:23:46):**  I got this property in 2006, I believe, yeah, coming back to Argentina and subsequently  
**[0:24:00-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:24:00):**  other properties in that neighborhood came for sale and they're all connected and so  
**[0:24:05-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:24:05):**  the last one, the fourth one was...  
**[0:24:08-0:24:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:24:08):**  We got that a year and a half ago and so the project is 10 years in and it's been a very  
**[0:24:15-0:24:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:24:15):**  organic process regarding taking the programming I was doing internationally, which was certainly  
**[0:24:22-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:24:22):**  natural building as well as permaculture and then we would always teach food as medicine  
**[0:24:27-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:24:27):**  and fermentation and in our trainings we would just naturally arrive and start fermenting  
**[0:24:32-0:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:24:32):**  food.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:24:33):**  So by the end of the training, we were eating our kraut and drinking our wheat and our wine  
**[0:24:39-0:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:24:39):**  that we made.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:24:40):**  So we brought all of those programs...  
**[0:24:43-0:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:24:43):**  I brought all those programs to Ashlulich and frankly, over the years, I just...  
**[0:24:51-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:24:51):**  As I grew older, I realized that I was in this pattern of taking on too much and of  
**[0:24:57-0:25:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:24:57):**  overwhelm and I'm sure you in many years in the modern age can relate and so after many  
**[0:25:05-0:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:25:05):**  years of hosting programming there at Ashlulich Sanctuary, it became just clear that I needed  
**[0:25:14-0:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:25:14):**  to kind of clear the plate of it and so I'll just say briefly that there's something now  
**[0:25:21-0:25:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:25:21):**  called Permaculture School and it's the permacultureschool.org and we also have an  
**[0:25:28-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:25:28):**  Instagram...  
**[0:25:29-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:25:29):**  New Instagram account.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:25:30):**  I'm kind of obsessed with Instagram now, but anyway, Instagram permacultureschool and  
**[0:25:36-0:25:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:25:36):**  all of our programming that I used to run is now being developed to go online and we're  
**[0:25:44-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:25:44):**  going to have over the coming years multiple permaculture-related programming and so I'm  
**[0:25:51-0:25:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:25:51):**  sure natural building will be proud of that, students' medicine, all the other aspects  
**[0:25:55-0:26:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:25:55):**  that make up the whole sort of permaculture, you know, everything within that.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:26:03):**  That's a lot.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:26:04):**  Sure.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:26:05):**  Yeah, that's going to be a really well-rounded program it sounds like.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:26:08):**  Yeah, well, it will be many programs.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:26:10):**  We're going to have...we're working with an online platform partner that provides college  
**[0:26:16-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:26:16):**  credit and so it's exciting and we haven't...  
**[0:26:19-0:26:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:26:19):**  It is, yeah.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:26:20):** ...made any big announcements about that yet, but in the coming year we'll be launching  
**[0:26:24-0:26:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:26:24):**  some of those programs and so anyway, that's happening, but meanwhile at Ashlulich Sanctuary  
**[0:26:32-0:26:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:26:32):**  there's been a big shift that we've shifted our programming from posting there to now  
**[0:26:40-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:26:40):**  moving it online and there's also been a big shift in the working with the land at  
**[0:26:47-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:26:47):**  the sanctuary and we've done some natural building there.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:26:51):**  All the existing houses were retrofitted, renovated with all natural interior finishes  
**[0:26:58-0:27:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:26:58):**  and then we also did exterior plaster so it's all got clay and mud all over it and it's  
**[0:27:04-0:27:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:27:04):**  quite beautiful.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:27:05):**  Yeah, I saw the pictures from that.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:27:06):**  It's creating a beautiful space.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:27:07):**  Yeah, very much so and the intention from the get-go is to create an urban-based, eco-urban,  
**[0:27:17-0:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:27:17):**  living-learning laboratory that models what we can do in our own backyard in an urban  
**[0:27:21-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:27:21):**  setting, recognizing that so many people are living in urban spaces and, you know, how  
**[0:27:27-0:27:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:27:27):**  can we actually transfer what we're doing and all these concepts of creating regenerative  
**[0:27:34-0:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:27:34):**  living solutions, how can that actually apply in urban environments.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:27:41):**  And so this property, when I first got it, actually was very junked out, a bit of a junkyard  
**[0:27:50-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:27:50):**  and one of the houses was a crack house, literally a crack house.  
**[0:27:55-0:27:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:27:55):**  It could barely breathe inside.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:27:58):**  It was quite gross.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:28:03):**  And so, over the last 10 years, there's been this incredible process of working with  
**[0:28:07-0:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:28:07):**  the land and finding the site and really listening to and attuning with and building relationships  
**[0:28:14-0:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:28:14):**  with the land and asking the land itself what it wants to be of service to and how it wants  
**[0:28:24-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:28:24):**  to be engaged.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:28:27):**  And so, it's been a fascinating journey and I want that...  
**[0:28:32-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:28:32):**  For a long time, I was still in that pattern of overwhelm and I can't say I'm 100%  
**[0:28:39-0:28:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:28:39):**  out of it, but there's been a big shift and now we're...  
**[0:28:44-0:28:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:28:44):**  I mean I can go on a little bit.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:28:46):**  I'll just...  
**[0:28:47-0:28:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:28:47):**  I'll share a little bit more around this, because it's very much my new focus.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:28:51):**  It is well.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:28:52):**  Yeah, great.  
**[0:28:54-0:29:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:28:54):**  Well, it came to a point where I was missing my international work and I felt as if I was  
**[0:29:03-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:29:03):**  really pushing uphill and growing a grain of my own nature and just pretty stressful  
**[0:29:11-0:29:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:29:11):**  to have this particular project and it wasn't my joy.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:29:15):**  You know, and I was used to living very much attuned to my joy.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:29:23):**  So it got to a place where I almost was ready to let it go and I walked up on the land that  
**[0:29:28-0:29:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:29:28):**  borders on this mountain and I used to go walking and I would ask for guidance and I  
**[0:29:36-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:29:36):**  got this very clear guidance not to spell the place and that it was going to be very  
**[0:29:43-0:29:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:29:43):**  needed and a great gift and important service and then very soon after that I had this sort  
**[0:29:53-0:29:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:29:53):**  of this experience of this sort of angelic presence that came through and this message  
**[0:29:59-0:30:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:29:59):**  of the sanctuary being in service to the divine feminine and that it was a temple to the divine  
**[0:30:07-0:30:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:30:07):**  feminine.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:30:08):**  And so, you know, when something like that comes through as clearly as it did, I was  
**[0:30:15-0:30:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:30:15):**  like, okay, well, that's what's happening.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:30:18):**  All right.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:30:19):**  And at the time it wasn't obvious to me how and what and when and, you know, and I  
**[0:30:27-0:30:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:30:27):**  knew well enough that I didn't need to have all the details.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:30:32):**  I didn't need to know exactly what it meant or how it was going to work, but over the  
**[0:30:39-0:30:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:30:39):**  years it has become clearer and clearer as to what that means and that has been a really  
**[0:30:47-0:30:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:30:47):**  beautiful process for me personally and then also in the community that I've been in  
**[0:30:53-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:30:53):**  and for what I'm excited to be working with and working on in my life at this point and  
**[0:31:01-0:31:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:31:01):**  it's, you know, I'm always a mud mama at heart and now I'm working very much with  
**[0:31:10-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:31:10):**  women and then there's a lot more that I could say about all of that, but that's  
**[0:31:17-0:31:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:31:17):**  currently the primary work at the sanctuary is being a sanctuary to help anchor the divine  
**[0:31:23-0:31:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:31:23):**  feminine on the planet and in the hearts of our dear humanity and so, yeah.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:31:32):**  That's really beautiful.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:31:33):**  That's such an incredible transformation that you've overseen in the last, you were  
**[0:31:38-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:31:38):**  saying, 10 years too, the way that the property has transformed as well.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:31:43):**  Now I also read in a previous interview that you did that one of your major focuses has  
**[0:31:48-0:31:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:31:48):**  been finding ways to design systems that bring humans and nature together, especially in  
**[0:31:53-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:31:53):**  cities.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:31:54):**  Could you share some of the main ways that you found to facilitate this?  
**[0:31:58-0:32:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:31:58):**  Yeah, how bringing, say it again, sorry, go find.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:32:04):**  Ways to design systems and to bring humans and nature together, especially in cities.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:32:09):**  Yeah, well, I mean, actually the sanctuary, that's exactly what the intention was to  
**[0:32:18-0:32:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:32:18):**  be, was and is in part and talking about working with the divine feminine, it's also about  
**[0:32:23-0:32:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:32:23):**  working with the deeper patterns of nature, which are, we can get very caught up in the  
**[0:32:32-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:32:32):**  techniques and the technical end and the systems design and the hard escaping and the sort  
**[0:32:38-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:32:38):**  of outer landscape.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:32:39):**  Hey puppy, hi.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:32:40):**  There's so many dogs in there and I'm not involved in the property where I'm working  
**[0:32:47-0:32:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:32:47):**  right now.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:32:48):**  Wait, where are you by the way?  
**[0:32:49-0:32:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:32:49):**  I am in Guatemala at the moment.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:32:51):**  I'm working with a fantastic bamboo specialist named Charlie Rendell and I'm working to help  
**[0:32:57-0:33:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:32:57):**  him on his projects and I also have side contracts at the same time.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:33:01):**  But yeah, this is about as quiet as it ever gets.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:33:05):**  So the fact that they've been this quiet is quite a blessing, but don't worry, I have  
**[0:33:09-0:33:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:33:09):**  very easy ways of editing out the background noise, so don't mind them.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:33:14):**  Yeah, yeah, cool.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:33:15):**  That's great.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:33:16):**  I know, it's fun to know you're down in Guatemala right now.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:33:20):**  Yeah, so I mean, oh gosh, I mean this is like another whole thing we...  
**[0:33:29-0:33:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:33:29):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:33:30):**  In...  
**[0:33:31-0:33:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:33:31):**  Well, okay, just kind of going back and echoing what I was saying before is that I probably  
**[0:33:40-0:33:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:33:40):**  you've heard of City Repair and for those listening, if you've not heard of City Repair,  
**[0:33:45-0:33:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:33:45):**  it's a beautiful project that started in Portland, Oregon and I was close with some  
**[0:33:52-0:34:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:33:52):**  of the original City Repair folks and one of the sort of aspects of it is recognizing,  
**[0:34:01-0:34:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:34:01):**  you know, we can talk about all of these solutions, but then how do we actually bring them into  
**[0:34:09-0:34:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:34:09):**  our cities?  
**[0:34:10-0:34:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:34:10):**  And so I started City Repair because I worked closely with them in Portland in the early  
**[0:34:17-0:34:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:34:17):**  days back in the early 2000s and then hosted in Nashville some similar types of gatherings  
**[0:34:26-0:34:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:34:26):**  where we got communities from all over our city and different projects and organizations  
**[0:34:32-0:34:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:34:32):**  and businesses to come up with the things that they wanted to be doing and really brought  
**[0:34:39-0:34:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:34:39):**  the public together, cities together from the nonprofit, for-profit, schools, families,  
**[0:34:46-0:34:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:34:46):**  kids to work together to create the real projects on the ground and have this beautiful sort  
**[0:34:56-0:35:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:34:56):**  of like village celebration and participate in the creation of our own public spaces.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:35:05):**  And so that's still going on and I'm by no means the only person in Nashville or  
**[0:35:14-0:35:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:35:14):**  other places.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:35:15):**  I think there's a lot of people engaged with everything from urban farming to rooftop  
**[0:35:21-0:35:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:35:21):**  farming to school gardens to bringing natural buildings into all of these places and it's  
**[0:35:30-0:35:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:35:30):**  really wonderful.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:35:31):**  I actually just recently am literally leaving right now.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:35:38):**  I was visiting some places in Florida, at Georgia, and then also up in Virginia where  
**[0:35:45-0:35:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:35:45):**  there's these hubs of these sort of eco-urban centers of people who are using their spaces  
**[0:35:54-0:36:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:35:54):**  both as community organizing hubs as well as modeling and living, you know, doing a  
**[0:36:01-0:36:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:36:01):**  lot of barter exchange and realloting resources and being part of a, I would say, very grassroots,  
**[0:36:09-0:36:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:36:09):**  very active network that's happening throughout cities all across the country.  
**[0:36:14-0:36:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:36:14):**  I mean there's these little nodes in every city and it's really sweet to be connected  
**[0:36:22-0:36:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:36:22):**  to each other.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:36:23):**  So anyway, I've been kind of getting to your question in a variety of ways, but yeah,  
**[0:36:30-0:36:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:36:30):**  if you want to ask anything more specifically in that moment, but...  
**[0:36:33-0:36:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:36:33):**  No, actually that segues really nicely into the next question that I have, which for you  
**[0:36:40-0:36:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:36:40):**  is an incredibly influential community organizer.  
**[0:36:43-0:36:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:36:43):**  You've put together events, workshops, and centers for all kinds of regenerative living  
**[0:36:47-0:36:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:36:47):**  skills and grassroots efforts, but more specifically, my question is in a world that's increasingly  
**[0:36:52-0:36:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:36:52):**  obsessed with new technology, how do you get people fired up and inspired for concepts  
**[0:36:57-0:37:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:36:57):**  and practices that are often viewed as old and outdated such as gardening, building with  
**[0:37:02-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:37:02):**  mud, or fermentation, just to name a few?  
**[0:37:07-0:37:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:37:07):**  Well that's, yeah, it's fascinating because it's, I guess in my world there's so much  
**[0:37:14-0:37:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:37:14):**  interest in that and I guess from my perspective it's only growing more and more.  
**[0:37:21-0:37:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:37:21):**  I mean even just you mentioned fermentation and that's one aspect of what you're naming,  
**[0:37:26-0:37:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:37:26):**  but even the natural building movement and the wild foods and local foods and grow your  
**[0:37:34-0:37:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:37:34):**  own and DIY and primitive skills and Earth skills, all of these things to me it seems  
**[0:37:40-0:37:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:37:40):**  very actively engaged in growing in the world.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:37:46):**  And I wouldn't say that they have to be separate in the sense as far as technology goes, part  
**[0:37:54-0:38:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:37:54):**  of why natural building has grown in its popularity is Oliver Swan out of England who has natural  
**[0:38:04-0:38:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:38:04):**  homes.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:38:05):**  I think naturalhome.com or.org.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:38:07):**  Yeah,.org.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:38:08):**  I can't remember the exact URL, but yeah,.org.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:38:13):**  And he's super savvy with social media and has created incredible engagements through  
**[0:38:20-0:38:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:38:20):**  Facebook.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:38:21):**  Yeah, his Facebook forums are really great platform for that stuff, I agree.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:38:28):**  Yeah, I mean it's phenomenal what he's done for the natural building movement and  
**[0:38:35-0:38:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:38:35):**  Paul Eaton with Permies.com.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:38:38):**  So I think utilizing and not just simple technology, social media, we can talk about high tech  
**[0:38:45-0:38:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:38:45):**  technology, but just simple technology like that I think can really serve to help share  
**[0:38:52-0:39:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:38:52):**  information, help people who can't take a year off from their whatever life they're  
**[0:39:01-0:39:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:39:01):**  living and for whatever reason not able to remove themselves entirely that they can have  
**[0:39:07-0:39:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:39:07):**  access to and learn about and be inspired.  
**[0:39:11-0:39:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:39:11):**  I think all these online forums, I mean the whole tiny e-house movement is an example  
**[0:39:16-0:39:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:39:16):**  where I think there's this huge, huge movement that's like incredibly fascinating to come  
**[0:39:26-0:39:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:39:26):**  from such a consumer-based culture and have that be as popular as it is.  
**[0:39:34-0:39:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:39:34):**  And I think there's actually a lot of engagement for people who are looking to simplify and  
**[0:39:42-0:39:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:39:42):**  downsize and de-consumerize and really move more toward voluntary simplicity.  
**[0:39:47-0:39:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:39:47):**  And I think that the world of technology, I don't...  
**[0:39:53-0:39:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:39:53):**  Well, I wouldn't say that it's not necessarily not a good or bad thing.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:39:59):**  I do see its impact and how heavily it has impacted our modern way of living in a way  
**[0:40:06-0:40:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:40:06):**  that wouldn't be what I would wish for humanity, but it is where we are.  
**[0:40:11-0:40:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:40:11):**  So now how can we incorporate and bring our brilliance into what's happening in the  
**[0:40:22-0:40:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:40:22):**  world in the most ecologically sound way that we can?  
**[0:40:26-0:40:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:40:26):**  And I think that there are a lot of phenomenal solutions out there.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:40:30):**  I mean, I don't know, every direction I look, that's what I...  
**[0:40:35-0:40:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:40:35):**  If you're in the network, then you can see that it's just happening in so many innovations.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:40:42):**  You know, and for folks listening, if you want to get a really broad sense of what's  
**[0:40:46-0:40:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:40:46):**  happening, you can look at Bioneers has a great kind of net of folks who are engaged  
**[0:40:54-0:40:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:40:54):**  with so many aspects of regenerative living.  
**[0:40:57-0:41:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:40:57):**  That's just one network, but I mean, just the Buckminster Fuller Institute, there's  
**[0:41:05-0:41:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:41:05):**  all...  
**[0:41:06-0:41:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:41:06):**  There's so much that's happening and I think a lot of businesses, too, are looking  
**[0:41:11-0:41:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:41:11):**  for ways to reconfigure in a way that, you know, just recognizing the dead end that the  
**[0:41:21-0:41:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:41:21):**  old school sort of patriarchal, very non-humanized way of doing business just isn't going to  
**[0:41:29-0:41:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:41:29):**  work anymore.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:41:30):**  And so there's a lot of interest in new models and it is a fascinating time to be  
**[0:41:41-0:41:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:41:41):**  alive.  
**[0:41:42-0:41:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:41:42):**  Sure.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:41:43):**  You know, and even with all of that said, I...  
**[0:41:45-0:41:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:41:45):**  You know, the way it's like a kind of a...one way of looking at it, I could also just say  
**[0:41:51-0:42:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:41:51):**  that there's, I think, an important thing for all of us to remember to do is to disconnect,  
**[0:42:00-0:42:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:42:00):**  you know, and turn our phones off and go outside and be in our bodies and, you know, kind of  
**[0:42:06-0:42:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:42:06):**  go on a fast from technology every once in a while and really take the time to lay on  
**[0:42:12-0:42:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:42:12):**  the ground and be barefoot.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:42:14):**  And, you know, whatever ways that each of us knows how to reconnect, you know, take  
**[0:42:21-0:42:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:42:21):**  a day in silence and walk out in the mountains or wherever you are in nature.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:42:27):**  Go be by water.  
**[0:42:29-0:42:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:42:29):**  Like these are all, I think, really, really critical steps.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:42:34):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:35-0:42:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:42:35):**  So, you know, I realize I didn't...  
**[0:42:38-0:42:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:42:38):**  Yeah, I love those observations.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:42:40):**  I agree.  
**[0:42:41-0:42:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:42:41):**  Those are really important, especially in these days when people are constantly...  
**[0:42:43-0:42:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:42:43):**  Yeah, I mean...  
**[0:42:44-0:42:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:42:44):** ...connecting through different means.  
**[0:42:45-0:42:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:42:45):**  And I know I struggle myself from a bit of an addiction to technology once in a while,  
**[0:42:51-0:42:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:42:51):**  even though I do work, you know, in natural building and in permaculture and I do get  
**[0:42:55-0:42:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:42:55):**  outside all the time.  
**[0:42:57-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:42:57):**  Those pulls and those new ways of being connected can definitely take a hold of you if you're  
**[0:43:01-0:43:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:43:01):**  not constantly aware of how you use them.  
**[0:43:04-0:43:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:43:04):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:43:05):**  And it's, I mean, you know, it's not just people in the tech world.  
**[0:43:09-0:43:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:43:09):**  It's people in the world, period.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:43:11):**  I think we need to remember all of us.  
**[0:43:13-0:43:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:43:13):**  You know, you can be a mud builder, a match builder and still be...  
**[0:43:19-0:43:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:43:19):**  I mean, like I was busy all the time and constantly, you know, so much so that it's easy to feel,  
**[0:43:26-0:43:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:43:26):**  yeah, this like sort of constant stress mode.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:43:30):**  Yeah, that's the balance that I started with right now.  
**[0:43:32-0:43:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:43:32):**  That's the deprogramming I needed to go through.  
**[0:43:35-0:43:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:43:35):**  For sure.  
**[0:43:36-0:43:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:43:36):**  Yeah.  
**[0:43:37-0:43:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:43:37):**  And I think it's easy, you know, it's a byproduct of living in the world that we  
**[0:43:42-0:43:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:43:42):**  do.  
**[0:43:43-0:43:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:43:43):**  And so, I know those of us who feel called to be doing the work that we're doing, there's  
**[0:43:49-0:43:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:43:49):**  this internal repatterning, not just the external, but the internal repatterning that I think  
**[0:43:58-0:43:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:43:58):**  we need to go through.  
**[0:43:59-0:44:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:43:59):**  And there's also this sense that, you know, that we have to work hard, because we're  
**[0:44:05-0:44:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:44:05):**  working against the machine and we have to like, you know, do everything we can.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:44:10):**  And it's a lot to take that on.  
**[0:44:11-0:44:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:44:11):**  And I think the self-care and the community care, I mean, I have made every mistake in  
**[0:44:17-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:44:17):**  the book along the way regarding all of that.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:44:19):**  And I've had to learn some hard lessons around how to show up in a way that honors  
**[0:44:26-0:44:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:44:26):**  the whole human, you know.  
**[0:44:28-0:44:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:44:28):**  And there's this...  
**[0:44:29-0:44:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:44:29):**  I mean, I'm half German.  
**[0:44:30-0:44:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:44:30):**  So, there's this sort of part of me that's very focused on making an efficient work site  
**[0:44:39-0:44:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:44:39):**  that's very systemized and, you know, and it can often be this, just this basic human,  
**[0:44:45-0:44:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:44:45):**  you know, the enjoyment, the pleasure, and the pleasure body of just living a good life.  
**[0:44:51-0:44:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:44:51):**  So, in a way, that's one of the most radical things we can do is to enjoy and laugh and  
**[0:44:58-0:45:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:44:58):**  to take the time to celebrate and be in that way, whatever we're working on, whether  
**[0:45:05-0:45:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:45:05):**  you're in your office building or you're on your natural building site.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:45:09):**  That's lovely.  
**[0:45:10-0:45:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:45:10):**  I love that observation.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:45:11):**  Yeah, I think that's important, too.  
**[0:45:13-0:45:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:45:13):**  Yeah, thank you.  
**[0:45:14-0:45:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:45:14):**  So, let me transition here to a similar question to the last one that I had, which I really  
**[0:45:21-0:45:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:45:21):**  want your opinion on, because you've worked so much in international settings and in countries  
**[0:45:26-0:45:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:45:26):**  around the world.  
**[0:45:27-0:45:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:45:27):**  Now, I myself have worked mostly on projects outside of the U.S. and the Western world,  
**[0:45:32-0:45:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:45:32):**  and I found that natural building methods are often looked at as methods that are only  
**[0:45:36-0:45:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:45:36):**  suitable for the poor or for those who can't afford cement and industrial materials.  
**[0:45:42-0:45:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:45:42):**  How have you worked to change those perceptions in the communities that you've worked in?  
**[0:45:46-0:45:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:45:46):**  Oh, yeah, great.  
**[0:45:49-0:45:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:45:49):**  Thank you.  
**[0:45:50-0:45:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:45:50):**  Well, I would say, for sure, one of the things that still is very much a part of the work  
**[0:45:58-0:46:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:45:58):**  that I do and something that...  
**[0:46:02-0:46:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:46:02):**  You know, and I'm not...  
**[0:46:03-0:46:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:46:03):**  I'm going to share my, you know, this is me and this doesn't have to be everyone.  
**[0:46:07-0:46:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:46:07):**  This isn't everybody's path and it's fine if this isn't your thing, but for me,  
**[0:46:13-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:46:13):**  the element of beauty and bringing in and creating something that's beautiful, that  
**[0:46:21-0:46:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:46:21):**  by itself, without any need to explain or convince, just because it is beautiful will  
**[0:46:28-0:46:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:46:28):**  speak to the soul, you know, and will call people's attention to it and ignite something  
**[0:46:34-0:46:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:46:34):**  in whether someone, you know, lives in a mansion and they see it or they live in a, you know,  
**[0:46:41-0:46:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:46:41):**  a simple hot hut, but just the beauty itself of creating something that, yeah, has an elegance.  
**[0:46:50-0:46:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:46:50):**  It will...  
**[0:46:52-0:46:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:46:52):**  You don't really need to do much more, frankly.  
**[0:46:54-0:46:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:46:54):**  I mean, I would say like that could be the answer, but...  
**[0:46:59-0:47:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:46:59):**  And emphasizing that and not everyone in natural building that's not everybody's  
**[0:47:03-0:47:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:47:03):**  focus, but, you know, and it's...same with permaculture and frankly, I do...I will say,  
**[0:47:11-0:47:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:47:11):**  you know, it's not a judgment thing, but I do see where some projects within this movement  
**[0:47:20-0:47:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:47:20):**  have given permaculture and natural building a bad name if they're not finished and they're  
**[0:47:24-0:47:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:47:24):**  messy and they're just like, you know, super sloppy and just kind of half-assed, frankly.  
**[0:47:29-0:47:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:47:29):**  It leaves a bit of a bad name and, like, if you create a site that is really...  
**[0:47:39-0:47:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:47:39):**  Hello puppy.  
**[0:47:41-0:47:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:47:41):**  If you...  
**[0:47:42-0:47:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:47:42):**  I'm going to pause and pause, but I'm going to let the dog...  
**[0:47:48-0:47:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:47:48):**  Let her have a little...  
**[0:47:51-0:47:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:47:51):**  Yeah, if you...  
**[0:47:52-0:47:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:47:52):**  It's a challenge.  
**[0:47:53-0:48:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:47:53):**  I think that's a project where it's obvious that a lot of care has gone into it, whether  
**[0:48:00-0:48:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:48:00):**  it be very quaint or very, you know, elegant, whatever bridge you want to use.  
**[0:48:04-0:48:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:48:04):**  I think really that's what speaks to people and, you know, I'm going to say it again,  
**[0:48:10-0:48:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:48:10):**  Oliver Swan.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:48:11):**  He's very particular about the photos that get shown and can't have, you know, tarps  
**[0:48:16-0:48:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:48:16):**  hanging on buildings that, you know, is like a trashed out site.  
**[0:48:20-0:48:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:48:20):**  It's a big turn off, you know, and how he's built an audience and a community of folks  
**[0:48:25-0:48:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:48:25):**  who are really engaged in natural building.  
**[0:48:28-0:48:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:48:28):**  You know, a very, very popular Facebook site is because the photos are beautiful and so  
**[0:48:35-0:48:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:48:35):**  that's...  
**[0:48:36-0:48:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:48:36):**  I would say that's almost a number one and it might sound superficial, but when you think  
**[0:48:43-0:48:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:48:43):**  of...  
**[0:48:45-0:48:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:48:45):**  For me, it's not superficial.  
**[0:48:46-0:48:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:48:46):**  For me, it's that you can put intention and care and love and very, you know, well-thought-out  
**[0:48:55-0:49:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:48:55):**  design and just, you know, like really show up for something and love on it in a way that  
**[0:49:02-0:49:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:49:02):**  leaves something that's just very appealing.  
**[0:49:06-0:49:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:49:06):**  And so that...  
**[0:49:08-0:49:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:49:08):**  I mean, I think that goes incredibly far away.  
**[0:49:11-0:49:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:49:11):**  Yeah, I'm really glad that you brought that up.  
**[0:49:13-0:49:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:49:13):**  That's a thing that I've been trying to communicate to a lot of people as well.  
**[0:49:17-0:49:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:49:17):**  As big of a fan as I am of, you know, some of the natural building schools and some of  
**[0:49:22-0:49:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:49:22):**  the instructors that I've worked with, I often don't show some of their work to people who  
**[0:49:27-0:49:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:49:27):**  I'm trying to impress upon, you know, the potential of natural building just because  
**[0:49:32-0:49:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:49:32):**  of the state in which they leave it in.  
**[0:49:36-0:49:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:49:36):**  You know, and like you said, it isn't just being superficial.  
**[0:49:39-0:49:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:49:39):**  It does reflect a certain amount of love and care and intention that you put into your  
**[0:49:43-0:49:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:49:43):**  sites and I'm really glad you brought that up.  
**[0:49:47-0:49:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:49:47):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:49:48-0:49:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:49:48):**  And, you know, I mean there's the reality too that if you're working on a budget or  
**[0:49:53-0:49:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:49:53):**  you...maybe you got all up in natural building, but you don't know carpentry and that's,  
**[0:49:59-0:50:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:49:59):**  you know, actually that's true for me.  
**[0:50:01-0:50:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:50:01):**  I'm not a carpentry.  
**[0:50:02-0:50:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:50:02):**  I'm a mud bomber, but I do to bring in the carpenters.  
**[0:50:07-0:50:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:50:07):**  And really the natural buildings that I think have done the most for the movement as a whole  
**[0:50:14-0:50:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:50:14):**  have been the ones that oftentimes are built with folks who do know how to hang a door  
**[0:50:21-0:50:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:50:21):**  well and, you know, put on a rim and, you know, have a gutter and like all...exactly  
**[0:50:27-0:50:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:50:27):**  all the details.  
**[0:50:28-0:50:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:50:28):**  And so that, you know, if you build a natural building and build it beautifully, it's going  
**[0:50:32-0:50:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:50:32):**  to appeal to anyone.  
**[0:50:33-0:50:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:50:33):**  They don't...you know, it's not going to be relegated to some, you know, something  
**[0:50:40-0:50:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:50:40):**  that's just for people who can't afford a cement house.  
**[0:50:43-0:50:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:50:43):**  So that's what I...  
**[0:50:45-0:50:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:50:45):**  I'll just go to my experience working in Thailand in...  
**[0:50:52-0:50:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:50:52):**  I think the first time I started there was 2000, 2001 and then went back...  
**[0:50:59-0:51:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:50:59):**  I think it was 2000, 2001, and then went back to Thailand and then went back to Thailand  
**[0:51:06-0:51:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:51:06):**  and then went back to Thailand.  
**[0:51:07-0:51:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:51:07):**  And I was in Thailand recently over a number of years and it caught on big time.  
**[0:51:12-0:51:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:51:12):**  I mean, literally the hundreds of thousands of people across Thailand and neighboring  
**[0:51:18-0:51:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:51:18):**  countries heard about natural building.  
**[0:51:20-0:51:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:51:20):**  Part of that, you know, so there's beauty, but then there was also just...  
**[0:51:25-0:51:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:51:25):**  I mean, we were able to speak really intelligibly about what we were doing and we were on the  
**[0:51:31-0:51:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:51:31):**  cover of magazines and people caught on and they just got super turned on by it.  
**[0:51:35-0:51:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:51:35):**  And we had everything from the Princess Hotel, you know, sort of like the tourism industry  
**[0:51:40-0:51:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:51:40):**  wanted it, very wealthy folks, an under-ease that was the center of Bangkok, all the way  
**[0:51:48-0:51:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:51:48):**  to these radical...  
**[0:51:49-0:51:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:51:49):**  I say radical, I mean it's the best of terms.  
**[0:51:53-0:51:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:51:53):**  And those were the ones we chose to work with, this radical sort of revolutionary land-based  
**[0:51:58-0:52:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:51:58):**  movement, people movement, and not to be focused on working with...just working with groups  
**[0:52:05-0:52:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:52:05):**  like the Assembly of the Poor and so on.  
**[0:52:07-0:52:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:52:07):**  But we also really encouraged...  
**[0:52:08-0:52:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:52:08):**  And this is something that I want to say very clearly that there is no one way to go about  
**[0:52:18-0:52:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:52:18):**  building this movement, you know.  
**[0:52:20-0:52:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:52:20):**  If someone's drawn to being in service in a village environment, great.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:52:26):**  And if you are interested in developing an architecture firm that helps build urban-based  
**[0:52:32-0:52:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:52:32):**  natural buildings, great.  
**[0:52:33-0:52:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:52:33):**  And if you're the one who wants to do the research and write a book, great.  
**[0:52:38-0:52:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:52:38):**  You know, like whatever you're...or you want to be the banker that funds it, you know,  
**[0:52:42-0:52:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:52:42):**  like whatever angle you're coming from.  
**[0:52:46-0:52:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:52:46):**  If you want to build a resort, you're going to do it with roots and materials and be a  
**[0:52:51-0:52:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:52:51):**  model for how the tourism industry can shift to being truly ecologically green, eco, not  
**[0:52:59-0:53:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:52:59):**  just green-washed, you know, all the power to you.  
**[0:53:02-0:53:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:53:02):**  So I'm a big fan of and worked pretty diligently to make sure that our training brought people  
**[0:53:13-0:53:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:53:13):**  from all walks of life.  
**[0:53:14-0:53:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:53:14):**  We often had a cross-pollination of people who...  
**[0:53:21-0:53:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:53:21):**  It wasn't just coming from different countries, and we almost always had people from five  
**[0:53:26-0:53:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:53:26):**  to 15 different countries, but we were also working across economic divides.  
**[0:53:33-0:53:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:53:33):**  We were working across language divides, and, you know, I'm using the word divide, but it  
**[0:53:38-0:53:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:53:38):**  was actually, you know, sort of the opposite.  
**[0:53:42-0:53:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:53:42):**  And so that's, you know, I think that's, um, I guess what I'm saying.  
**[0:53:49-0:53:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:53:49):**  So we had the beauty aspect.  
**[0:53:52-0:54:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:53:52):**  We also had access to the media and confusing the media in a smart way, and then we worked  
**[0:54:01-0:54:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:54:01):**  across many lines in a very diverse pool of people.  
**[0:54:07-0:54:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:54:07):**  And yeah, you know, certainly my passion was working with people, the people-based movements.  
**[0:54:18-0:54:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:54:18):**  That was always, for me, the greatest honor.  
**[0:54:21-0:54:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:54:21):**  I was invited often to do big, sort of these well-funded, fancy projects, and I had little  
**[0:54:30-0:54:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:54:30):**  to no interest in those.  
**[0:54:32-0:54:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:54:32):**  Although, you know, frankly, looking back, I actually think there's a lot of merit there.  
**[0:54:37-0:54:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:54:37):**  I know that doing a high-end project in a city could have great impact, and it was years  
**[0:54:43-0:54:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:54:43):**  later I was invited to consider doing a project in New York City on the High Line, and it  
**[0:54:50-0:54:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:54:50):**  was at a place time when I was starting to transition out, but those kinds of projects,  
**[0:54:54-0:55:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:54:54):**  I think, are credible service to the natural building world to do a fancier natural building  
**[0:55:02-0:55:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:55:02):**  project.  
**[0:55:03-0:55:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:55:03):**  And I would encourage... Sometimes you get caught up in this mentality that, you know,  
**[0:55:09-0:55:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:55:09):**  it has to only be DIY or FBI, if you don't know it, but do it yourself, sort of like  
**[0:55:15-0:55:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:55:15):**  this very...  
**[0:55:16-0:55:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:55:16):**  You know, you can't...  
**[0:55:17-0:55:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:55:17):**  Yeah, I just am a big fan of working it from all angles, you know.  
**[0:55:25-0:55:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:55:25):**  Sure.  
**[0:55:26-0:55:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:55:26):**  I think there's a lot of merit to that.  
**[0:55:29-0:55:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:55:29):**  Well, I like what you said, too, about bringing people together from lots of walks of life.  
**[0:55:35-0:55:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:55:35):**  And now you're the second person that I've interviewed in a short period of time that  
**[0:55:40-0:55:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:55:40):**  puts great emphasis on the inclusion and empowerment of women in every aspect of regenerative living.  
**[0:55:45-0:55:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:55:45):**  Obviously, this is an incredibly important time in history when women are still marginalized  
**[0:55:51-0:55:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:55:51):**  and excluded from many aspects of life and work, but could you share a little bit about  
**[0:55:55-0:56:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:55:55):**  how you've gotten women involved in the transformation of their communities and some of the ways  
**[0:56:00-0:56:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:56:00):**  that the rest of us can work towards more inclusive work in community environments for  
**[0:56:04-0:56:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:56:04):**  everyone, particularly in cultures where there are often clearly defined gender roles?  
**[0:56:10-0:56:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:56:10):**  Yeah.  
**[0:56:11-0:56:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:56:11):**  Gosh, interesting, because women are the center of community.  
**[0:56:17-0:56:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:56:17):**  So asking how to engage them, they're already engaged.  
**[0:56:20-0:56:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:56:20):**  They're the center of it, you know.  
**[0:56:22-0:56:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:56:22):**  Like, women are the ones doing so much of this.  
**[0:56:25-0:56:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:56:25):**  And unfortunately, my experience has always been that women are engaged in natural building.  
**[0:56:30-0:56:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:56:30):**  From the very moment I was in it, I've almost never experienced being on a site where it  
**[0:56:38-0:56:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:56:38):**  was, you know, a lot more men.  
**[0:56:41-0:56:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:56:41):**  It's always had women engaged.  
**[0:56:44-0:56:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:56:44):**  And the building industry as a whole is very male-dominated, but the natural building world  
**[0:56:50-0:56:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:56:50):**  networks are...there's a lot, a lot of women involved.  
**[0:56:56-0:57:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:56:56):**  And I guess I didn't really have to think about it in the sense of it was already there,  
**[0:57:04-0:57:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:57:04):**  but obviously, you know, you're assigning tools or tasks, being aware of how those get  
**[0:57:10-0:57:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:57:10):**  assigned and, you know, never assuming that a job particularly has to be done by a woman  
**[0:57:17-0:57:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:57:17):**  or a man specifically.  
**[0:57:18-0:57:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:57:18):**  You know, just really being conscious in how that engagement happens and how we never use  
**[0:57:25-0:57:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:57:25):**  the word manpower on our sites or man-made.  
**[0:57:28-0:57:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:57:28):**  I mean, there's no concept of that, you know.  
**[0:57:31-0:57:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:57:31):**  So just always acknowledging inclusive...using inclusive language, you know, human-made or  
**[0:57:38-0:57:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:57:38):**  that kind of thing so that it's just built in from the get-go that, you know, we're  
**[0:57:47-0:57:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:57:47):**  all part of the creation of whatever we're working on.  
**[0:57:52-0:57:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:57:52):**  And then I got excited about seeing women doing all of this and it was a really beautiful  
**[0:57:58-0:58:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:57:58):**  aspect for me of being involved with natural building.  
**[0:58:01-0:58:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:58:01):**  And so, I ended up, certainly, um, I was excited to work with women especially and did some  
**[0:58:12-0:58:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:58:12):**  exclusive programming with women only and that was really just a fantastic way to be  
**[0:58:21-0:58:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:58:21):**  on the site, because there is...  
**[0:58:23-0:58:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:58:23):**  I do...  
**[0:58:24-0:58:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:58:24):**  Yeah, you know, there is a sort of dominant heteronormative gender roles that people can  
**[0:58:31-0:58:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:58:31):**  fall into and so if you're on a site where it's only women, what's going to happen  
**[0:58:36-0:58:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:58:36):**  is if some task comes along, then one of the women is going to do it, you know.  
**[0:58:42-0:58:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:58:42):**  Then all the women are engaged and it's a way to create a very empowering environment.  
**[0:58:47-0:58:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:58:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:58:48-0:58:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:58:48):**  So, and I think simply because I am a woman and I was in the leadership position, that  
**[0:58:56-0:59:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:58:56):**  certainly was just part of it and I often worked...  
**[0:59:02-0:59:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:59:02):**  You know, any time I was invited to work in communities, especially internationally, I  
**[0:59:08-0:59:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:59:08):**  would always ask, who were the others in the area who had a skill set in that particular  
**[0:59:15-0:59:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:59:15):**  kind of work?  
**[0:59:16-0:59:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:59:16):**  And oftentimes, men who were already experienced, I would say, will bring them so that they  
**[0:59:23-0:59:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:59:23):**  can...we can up-level, upgrade the leadership that's already here at the community.  
**[0:59:28-0:59:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:59:28):**  And so I would be working often with men who are sometimes more than twice my age, but  
**[0:59:34-0:59:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:59:34):**  I'm an old and confident woman, so I had no problem being a strong leader and sharing  
**[0:59:40-0:59:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:59:40):**  what I knew and I found that the men...  
**[0:59:43-0:59:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:59:43):**  I've always found that the men that I work with are very respectful.  
**[0:59:47-0:59:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:59:47):**  I mean, I've never been talked over.  
**[0:59:50-0:59:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:59:50):**  It's hard to talk about, but yeah, it's just like I've always been able to work  
**[0:59:57-1:00:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=0:59:57):**  with the men that I've been with in ways that have felt very mutually respectful and  
**[1:00:03-1:00:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=1:00:03):**  collaborative and, yeah.  
**[1:00:07-1:00:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=1:00:07):**  So I...  
**[1:00:08-1:00:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=1:00:08):**  You know, and I'm very grateful to the natural building world for how exclusive it is and  
**[1:00:16-1:00:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=1:00:16):**  I don't...  
**[1:00:17-1:00:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=1:00:17):**  At least in the places I've worked and, yeah.  
**[1:00:20-1:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=1:00:20):**  I'm so glad to hear that.  
**[1:00:22-1:00:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=1:00:22):**  It's very incredible.  
**[1:00:23-1:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=1:00:23):**  I agree that the natural building and permaculture worlds have done a really good job about being  
**[1:00:29-1:00:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=1:00:29):**  inclusive for people from all walks of life, genders, everything, and it's something that  
**[1:00:35-1:00:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=1:00:35):**  I'm really glad to see continue.  
**[1:00:38-1:00:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=1:00:38):**  Now before I let you go here, I know you've got a busy schedule as well, can you give  
**[1:00:43-1:00:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=1:00:43):**  me some contact information and a little heads up for any upcoming events or workshops that  
**[1:00:48-1:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=1:00:48):**  Ash Village is hosting?  
**[1:00:50-1:00:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=1:00:50):**  Sure, yeah, thank you.  
**[1:00:53-1:01:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=1:00:53):**  I would love to highlight that Ash Village Sanctuary, again, based in Ash, North Carolina,  
**[1:01:00-1:01:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=1:01:00):**  that we host...  
**[1:01:01-1:01:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=1:01:01):**  We're not hosting programs on the ground there, but what I can highlight is that we  
**[1:01:06-1:01:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=1:01:06):**  do host an internship program, a residential internship program, and that's really an  
**[1:01:12-1:01:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=1:01:12):**  opportunity and it's pretty women-focused, because that's what the sanctuary is up  
**[1:01:17-1:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=1:01:17):**  to right now.  
**[1:01:19-1:01:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=1:01:19):**  So we have this...it's a six-month engagement of living on site and working with us and  
**[1:01:27-1:01:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=1:01:27):**  being part of...really being part of our team that manages and runs the sanctuary and learning  
**[1:01:32-1:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=1:01:32):**  all about permaculture...well, permaculture gardening, site management, and all aspects  
**[1:01:39-1:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=1:01:39):**  of what's happening at the sanctuary, which I guess I'd love to just briefly highlight  
**[1:01:44-1:01:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=1:01:44):**  that we're working a lot with the healing arts and the embodied arts and also working  
**[1:01:54-1:01:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=1:01:54):**  around racial and social justice and definitely the land.  
**[1:01:59-1:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=1:01:59):**  It's medicine and herbalism.  
**[1:02:01-1:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=1:02:01):**  So it's an urban land-based project.  
**[1:02:06-1:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=1:02:06):**  So if anyone's interested in that, ashvillage.org, and I'm going to spell it.  
**[1:02:12-1:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=1:02:12):**  It's A-S-H-E and it's got to have a E. Ashvillage.org, so ashvillage.org, named after  
**[1:02:23-1:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=1:02:23):**  Asheville, of course, which is over-based.  
**[1:02:26-1:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=1:02:26):**  And on there you'll see information to get to the residential internship page.  
**[1:02:34-1:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=1:02:34):**  So there's that.  
**[1:02:36-1:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=1:02:36):**  And then Permaculture School and it's the permacultureschool.org will be both promoting  
**[1:02:46-1:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=1:02:46):**  its online programs and that will be in the months ahead and we're still a bit far out.  
**[1:02:52-1:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=1:02:52):**  Definitely, I'd say at least half a year or more.  
**[1:02:56-1:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=1:02:56):**  But we're also promoting a lot of other people's programs, because we have a large  
**[1:03:02-1:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=1:03:02):**  mailing list and network, social media, et cetera, we're really putting out promotion  
**[1:03:09-1:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=1:03:09):**  for all kinds of other programs that are happening in different parts of the country and also  
**[1:03:14-1:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=1:03:14):**  in other countries.  
**[1:03:15-1:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=1:03:15):**  So happy to promote if you're running a program and you want to get the word out,  
**[1:03:22-1:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=1:03:22):**  just be in touch and you could write to...  
**[1:03:26-1:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=1:03:26):**  Probably best to write to info at ashvillage.org if we can consider helping to spread the word  
**[1:03:32-1:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-010-janell-kapoor/#t=1:03:32):**  about your program.

### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 09 Oct 2020 07:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:00:09):**  You're in the right place for all things regenerative living, ecological restoration,  
**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:00:14):**  permaculture and natural building.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:00:16):**  I'm your host Oliver Gaucher.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:00:18):**  In this show, it's my job to interview leaders, innovators and rebels on the cutting edge  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:00:22):**  of their fields as we look for solutions to our generation's most urgent challenges  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:00:27):**  and share these techniques and information so that you can join us in creating a healthy  
**[0:00:31-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:00:31):**  and abundant world for everyone.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:00:33):**  So let's get started.  
**[0:00:42-0:00:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:00:42):**  Hello and welcome everybody.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:00:43):**  Now before we get started today, I want to tell those of you listening at home about  
**[0:00:46-0:00:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:00:46):**  an event that I know will be an inspiration to you.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:00:49):**  The Global Regeneration Colab will be hosting their TEDx event online this year and you're  
**[0:00:54-0:00:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:00:54):**  all invited to attend.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:00:56):**  The theme is Possible Futures, Acknowledging Stories of Regeneration in the Global South.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:01:01):**  There will be three panel discussions focusing on the story of the global south, decolonization  
**[0:01:06-0:01:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:01:06):**  and decolonizing the mind, and pluriversality and regeneration.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:01:11):**  This event will also feature breakout conversation rooms in various languages to promote exploration  
**[0:01:16-0:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:01:16):**  of subjects and ideas in a more intimate setting.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:01:19):**  So come and join us on October 17th to explore world history, cultural evolution, the age  
**[0:01:25-0:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:01:25):**  of complexity, maturation of globalization, human consciousness, and so much more.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:01:31):**  You can find the link for the signups and the opportunity to donate and support this  
**[0:01:34-0:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:01:34):**  event in the show notes for this episode at AbundantEdge.com.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:01:38):**  Now I know they're also looking for volunteers to translate some of these discussions, so  
**[0:01:41-0:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:01:41):**  if that's something you're up for, you can find the signup there as well.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:01:44):**  I look forward to seeing you all there.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:01:47):**  Alright, so in the last handful of episodes, we've explored permaculture earthworks for  
**[0:01:53-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:01:53):**  water harvesting landscapes and keyline design on large scales.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:01:57):**  As a complement to those topics, I got in touch with Brad Lancaster, the author of Rainwater  
**[0:02:02-0:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:02:02):**  Harvesting for Drylands and Beyond, both volumes 1 and 2, which have recently been re-released  
**[0:02:07-0:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:02:07):**  and expanded in new editions.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:02:10):**  Brad is an expert in the field of rainwater harvesting and water management, and whose  
**[0:02:13-0:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:02:13):**  work I've been following for a long time.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:02:16):**  He's also a permaculture teacher, designer, consultant, and co-founder of the nonprofit  
**[0:02:20-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:02:20):**  Desert Harvesters, which teaches the public how to identify, harvest, and process many  
**[0:02:25-0:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:02:25):**  of the native food plants endemic to the arid southwestern US.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:02:28):**  He's also been instrumental in helping to change water management policy and government  
**[0:02:33-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:02:33):**  incentives in the city of Tucson to help others implement waterwise catchment and reuse features  
**[0:02:38-0:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:02:38):**  on their properties.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:02:40):**  In this interview, we cover a wide range of topics, from the difference between active  
**[0:02:45-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:02:45):**  and passive water harvesting technology, and reading the landscape to determine how to  
**[0:02:49-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:02:49):**  work with the natural surroundings, to the increasing importance for water stewardship  
**[0:02:53-0:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:02:53):**  in non-arid climates, and why it's so important to connect and invest in the place you already  
**[0:02:59-0:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:02:59):**  live rather than thinking that moving to another place will solve your environmental worries.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:03:04):**  Brad also gives great advice on home-scale water harvesting and storage, which are all  
**[0:03:09-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:03:09):**  topics that are covered extensively in his books, and he's done an incredible job with  
**[0:03:13-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:03:13):**  the help of many experts and collaborators to compile tons of resources that are available  
**[0:03:17-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:03:17):**  to help you get started on his website, which I link to in the show notes for this episode.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:03:23):**  So from here, I'll hand the discussion over to Brad.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:03:25):**  Hey, Brad, thanks so much for taking the time to be with me today.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:03:29):**  How are you doing?  
**[0:03:30-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:03:30):**  Doing great, yeah.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:03:31):**  Thanks for having me on.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:03:32):**  Hey, it's my pleasure, and I've followed your work for a long time, and as much as I'd love  
**[0:03:36-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:03:36):**  to go into your background, it's super well-documented in so many other places, so I'll open with  
**[0:03:41-0:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:03:41):**  a question that you've talked about in the past and has really kind of sunk in for me,  
**[0:03:46-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:03:46):**  and that's the importance of committing to where you are and investing in your home's  
**[0:03:51-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:03:51):**  health and regeneration for the long term.  
**[0:03:54-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:03:54):**  I know that's a realization that you made pretty early on, and before had been thinking  
**[0:04:00-0:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:04:00):**  about leaving the Tucson area and maybe looking for greener pastures, so to speak.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:04:04):**  Can you talk a little about why you decided to stay and invest in your local area?  
**[0:04:10-0:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:04:10):**  Yeah, well, the person that I guess really solidified that decision for me was this African  
**[0:04:18-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:04:18):**  water farmer, Mr. Zephaniah Pirimiseko, who was a huge mentor for me.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:04:23):**  Even though I spent very little time in the scope of life with him, just a matter of days,  
**[0:04:32-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:04:32):**  he was very instrumental in my direction.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:04:36):**  So I was blown away by what he had done by committing to make change where change was  
**[0:04:44-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:04:44):**  most possible in his own life and on he and his family's own site.  
**[0:04:52-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:04:52):**  And they turned what had been just an eroding piece of land that was not productive into  
**[0:05:02-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:05:02):**  a relative oasis simply by planting the rain, stewarding more life in a way that gave back  
**[0:05:11-0:05:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:05:11):**  far more than it took from the environment.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:05:18):**  It was extremely inspirational because he had very little resources and yet did incredible  
**[0:05:26-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:05:26):**  work, far better work than I've seen many people with a lot of resources do.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:05:31):**  And so after spending a day with him, I started venting some of my frustrations of how bad  
**[0:05:41-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:05:41):**  I saw things going in my hometown of Tucson, Arizona and how we had been depleting our  
**[0:05:46-0:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:05:46):**  water resources, our soil fertility and so on.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:05:50):**  And I told him I didn't want to be part of that problem.  
**[0:05:54-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:05:54):**  And so I was thinking of leaving and asked him for some advice of where I might consider  
**[0:06:00-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:06:00):**  going.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:06:01):**  And he was very clear.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:06:02):**  He said, no, you have to go home and you have to set your roots deeper than you ever thought  
**[0:06:09-0:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:06:09):**  possible because if you run from your problems, you're just going to plant problems everywhere  
**[0:06:13-0:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:06:13):**  you go.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:06:14):**  So you've got to instead try and figure out how can you turn these problems into solutions.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:06:20):**  And if you're able to do that, then you can go anywhere because you'll have that ability  
**[0:06:27-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:06:27):**  to shift problems into solutions.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:06:30):**  So for whatever reason, I was very ready for that at that time and went home to make that  
**[0:06:39-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:06:39):**  commitment and not knowing exactly how I was going to turn things around, but I did have  
**[0:06:46-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:06:46):**  the inspiration of the work of Mr. Piri and his family.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:06:50):**  And I came home to figure out, well, how can I tweak that to the unique conditions of my  
**[0:06:55-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:06:55):**  site?  
**[0:06:56-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:06:56):**  And I've just found over time that it's been very rewarding and definitely challenging  
**[0:07:03-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:07:03):**  at times too.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:07:05):**  But no matter how bad something goes out in the world, in a meeting, in an interaction,  
**[0:07:13-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:07:13):**  what have you, I can come home and I can see things going in the right direction.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:07:21):**  Even if it's small, even if it's only the growth of a few leaves out of a budding tree,  
**[0:07:28-0:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:07:28):**  that's still going in the right direction and is very uplifting for me.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:07:31):**  And I'm able to learn on a daily basis with what is right outside my door.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:07:40):**  So it's very direct, very immediate.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:07:43):**  And I've found it's been powerful and inspiring others because they see, oh, you're doing  
**[0:07:50-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:07:50):**  this on your home scale, your neighborhood scale, which then links and informs the community  
**[0:07:58-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:07:58):**  scale and they see I can do that too.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:08:02):**  So yeah, it's empowering.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:08:04):**  I love that story.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:08:05):**  And it's been one of the reasons why I've connected with your work a lot.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:08:08):**  I mean, I've been traveling my whole life.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:08:10):**  I was born in Japan.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:08:12):**  I grew up mostly in Minnesota and I live in Spain now.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:08:16):**  Before I came here, I was doing projects in Guatemala and in Senegal and in the Philippines.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:08:22):**  As much as I love everything that I've learned and gained from the traveling experience,  
**[0:08:27-0:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:08:27):**  I've also noticed that everywhere I go, I sort of bring my own baggage and my own problems  
**[0:08:32-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:08:32):**  with me where they find a way of manifesting in whatever new situation that I find myself.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:08:38):**  Life gives you lessons that you need to learn and you can't run away from them.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:08:43):**  And sort of putting in roots, like you said, digging those roots down ever deeper is the  
**[0:08:49-0:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:08:49):**  way that I have found to not just gain insight that you never would have from an outside  
**[0:08:54-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:08:54):**  perspective coming into a project and giving advice on it and just applying the cold science  
**[0:09:01-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:09:01):**  of restoration, but understanding the people and learning the story of place and becoming  
**[0:09:07-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:09:07):**  a part of the community that you are trying to influence plays so much of a part in the  
**[0:09:13-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:09:13):**  process that I would almost say that it's a much bigger part than the actual techniques  
**[0:09:20-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:09:20):**  or the work done on the ground because of all of the emergent properties of those connections  
**[0:09:25-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:09:25):**  that don't necessarily start to come out in the beginning.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:09:29):**  It's something that takes a little while to establish and it's just one of the parts of  
**[0:09:33-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:09:33):**  your message that has always resonated with me.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:09:37):**  But with that said, let's go into talking about the two forms of water harvesting, both  
**[0:09:43-0:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:09:43):**  active and passive.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:09:45):**  And if you could give me a little overview of the differences between those and then  
**[0:09:48-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:09:48):**  we'll explore them deeper.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:09:50):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:09:51):**  So active is where people most often go when they first hear about water harvesting.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:09:58):**  And that would be a system with a tank and a valve on it because somebody has to actively  
**[0:10:06-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:10:06):**  turn on or off that valve for the system to work.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:10:10):**  So water can be released from the tank.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:10:15):**  And it doesn't have to be a person.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:10:17):**  It could be a mechanical timer, but still that mechanical timer is dependent on a person.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:10:25):**  And so active systems tend to be more expensive and they're reliant on manufactured or built  
**[0:10:34-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:10:34):**  elements.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:10:38):**  Whereas a passive system, that tends to be a living system where your tank is now, say  
**[0:10:49-0:10:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:10:49):**  the soil and the vegetation as opposed to a manufactured tank.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:10:54):**  So what that would look like, a passive system would be like a rain garden where you've got  
**[0:10:59-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:10:59):**  this basin in the landscape that's lower than the surrounding area or hardscape.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:11:06):**  And the runoff from the surrounding area is directed to that basin.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:11:11):**  So you might direct roof runoff to it, maybe street runoff, maybe just runoff from the  
**[0:11:16-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:11:16):**  adjoining landscape.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:11:18):**  So there's a greater concentration of water there.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:11:22):**  And then you are collaborating with soil life to create a much more absorbent living sponge  
**[0:11:30-0:11:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:11:30):**  of fertile high organic matter soil so that you're not storing the water on the soil,  
**[0:11:36-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:11:36):**  on top of the soil like a pond.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:11:38):**  Instead, you're rapidly infiltrating it so it's subsurface storage.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:11:43):**  That way you don't lose water to evaporation as you would with a pond.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:11:47):**  You don't have an issue of breeding mosquitoes because there's no standing water in which  
**[0:11:51-0:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:11:51):**  mosquitoes can breed.  
**[0:11:55-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:11:55):**  And then how do you access that water that's now stored subsurface?  
**[0:12:00-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:12:00):**  You plant pumps in the form of vegetation.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:12:03):**  So you can utilize and access that water in the form of fruit, food production, livestock  
**[0:12:10-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:12:10):**  fodder, wildlife habitat, shelter, shade, and so on.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:12:15):**  And that passive strategy also helps recharge our groundwater, which recharges our springs,  
**[0:12:24-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:12:24):**  our creeks, and our rivers.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:12:26):**  So it helps recharge surface waters as well in that sense.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:12:31):**  And I find that passive strategies tend to have a much higher capacity than active strategies.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:12:39):**  Because once your manufactured tank is full, until you empty it, you can't add any more  
**[0:12:46-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:12:46):**  water.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:12:47):**  Whereas a rain garden, an earthwork, it is infiltrating water constantly and making more  
**[0:12:56-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:12:56):**  capacity.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:12:57):**  And the more vegetation and the more life you have, the more it cycles and pumps that  
**[0:13:02-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:13:02):**  water more quickly.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:13:04):**  So I find, like let's say if we get a two inch rainstorm one day, all my tanks are full.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:13:13):**  And all my rain gardens, they fill up.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:13:16):**  But in a matter of a couple hours, all the water is infiltrated.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:13:20):**  And they're ready for another two inch storm.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:13:23):**  Just a couple hours after that initial two inch storm.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:13:27):**  Whereas those tanks won't be ready for another two inch storm until I've emptied them, which  
**[0:13:33-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:13:33):**  is going to be weeks later.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:13:36):**  So I find the passive strategies tend to be far more effective at flood control as well  
**[0:13:43-0:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:13:43):**  as water resiliency and getting you through dry times.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:13:47):**  And I find the passive systems tend to be far more multifunctional.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:13:54):**  Because they're growing so much more life.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:13:57):**  They're growing resources.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:14:00):**  Tanks themselves aren't growing so many resources.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:14:05):**  The water released from them can.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:14:07):**  But again, it's not as high a capacity.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:14:10):**  It's not as high a volume as the passive systems.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:14:13):**  So I use the two together.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:14:15):**  So if you're going to put in a tank system, make sure at a minimum you always overflow  
**[0:14:20-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:14:20):**  its water to a passive system.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:14:24):**  Earthworks, rain gardens.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:14:26):**  So you're making the most of the system.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:14:31):**  And I just wanted to jump really quick to what we were discussing before about committing  
**[0:14:38-0:14:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:14:38):**  to place.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:14:43):**  I love to try and find both historical active and passive systems in my area to see what  
**[0:14:50-0:14:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:14:50):**  worked for the people in this local climate.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:14:54):**  So that's a great thing to do.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:14:57):**  But that process also further connects me to place.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:15:01):**  Because I start learning more about the place's history.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:15:04):**  The cultural and traditional lineages.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:15:07):**  The ecological lineages.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:15:09):**  So I have found historic wetlands, Cienega's, and whatnot.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:15:18):**  And I get to learn from how these wetter microclimates in my area, what enabled them to get established?  
**[0:15:29-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:15:29):**  What enabled them to grow?  
**[0:15:33-0:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:15:33):**  What damaged them at some point in their history and minimized their size?  
**[0:15:37-0:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:15:37):**  All that is other great learning that can inform how I design and steward my strategies  
**[0:15:45-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:15:45):**  back home and in my neighborhood.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:15:47):**  Yeah, that's a very good point.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:15:49):**  And that's one of the things I've enjoyed most about the design process that I've done  
**[0:15:53-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:15:53):**  for my own projects and that I've helped other clients through as well.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:15:57):**  Is that simply by doing it, you're actually expanding your participation in these other  
**[0:16:02-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:16:02):**  aspects that maybe you didn't set out to get involved in.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:16:05):**  But are inevitably going to make it a richer experience and a more resilient design by  
**[0:16:11-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:16:11):**  having investigated and put yourself into the process itself?  
**[0:16:17-0:16:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:16:17):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:16:21):**  Just to share one little story.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:16:23):**  So I had a client that was all set on active tank systems when he called me for a consultation.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:16:32):**  And I went out to his site and saw that his roof surface was pretty low quality, not that  
**[0:16:39-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:16:39):**  big.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:16:40):**  And he wanted the water for irrigation, not for domestic use.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:16:46):**  So it didn't really seem a priority to me.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:16:49):**  Whereas I saw he had a little dry waterway, ephemeral waterway or ROYO as we call it on  
**[0:16:56-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:16:56):**  his property.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:16:57):**  And he had a lot of exposed bedrock from years of erosion.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:17:01):**  So I realized, wow, this guy's site is ripe for passive earthworks like one rock dams  
**[0:17:08-0:17:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:17:08):**  and so on that we could build on top of that bedrock.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:17:12):**  And we can create these amazing sponges and even potentially create ephemeral springs  
**[0:17:17-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:17:17):**  on his property.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:17:20):**  And saw a little example, a very small scale of where this had actually happened, where  
**[0:17:27-0:17:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:17:27):**  some rocks had just accumulated and locked themselves in the drainage, creating a small  
**[0:17:36-0:17:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:17:36):**  one rock dam, if you will, behind which a lot of organic matter accumulated, creating  
**[0:17:40-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:17:40):**  this sponge that held on to the water much longer.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:17:44):**  And sure enough, he relayed to me that after good rain, water would seep out of that area  
**[0:17:50-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:17:50):**  for a number of days.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:17:52):**  So it's like, great, there's the example.  
**[0:17:55-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:17:55):**  Now we can just build on this and improve it so you can have ephemeral springs that  
**[0:18:01-0:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:18:01):**  last for weeks as opposed to days.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:18:04):**  And that's the direction we took and that was the result.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:18:07):**  That's amazing.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:18:08):**  Yeah, it's so inspiring to see when you kind of have that understanding of what is  
**[0:18:13-0:18:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:18:13):**  possible and put in the necessary features or make the amendments or yeah, the little  
**[0:18:20-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:18:20):**  changes that are required and then nature takes over from there.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:18:23):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:18:24):**  Yeah, and each year we go back.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:18:27):**  It's better and better.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:18:28):**  Whereas every year you go back to see a tank, it doesn't get any better.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:18:34):**  No, it's on a road towards not centripetal entropy, right?  
**[0:18:39-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:18:39):**  All of your built environment stuff, your mechanical solutions.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:18:42):**  And most of them are just trying to imitate much more efficient and effective elements  
**[0:18:47-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:18:47):**  in nature.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:18:48):**  Like you mentioned the pump system bringing water up from the ground.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:18:52):**  Well, in the best case scenario, maybe you've got a high quality, high efficiency pump that  
**[0:18:56-0:19:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:18:56):**  runs on solar power or you could put in a plant which is already solar powered and requires  
**[0:19:03-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:19:03):**  no maintenance except for that it has a life cycle that you need to attend to.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:19:07):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:19:09):**  And two colleagues, Van Clothier and Bill Ziedike, colleagues and mentors outside Silver  
**[0:19:15-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:19:15):**  City, New Mexico on a ranch.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:19:17):**  They took a degraded rangeland in Cienega that had eroded away and with just very simple,  
**[0:19:28-0:19:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:19:28):**  on rock high structures, about 60 of them and working with the landowner to shift some  
**[0:19:34-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:19:34):**  of their land management.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:19:36):**  They have brought back a thriving wetlands.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:19:39):**  They've brought back perennial water and these wetlands are now growing themselves uphill,  
**[0:19:46-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:19:46):**  up the banks of the waterway following water that is rising with capillary action.  
**[0:19:54-0:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:19:54):**  And they've now gained and held so much water in this amazing living system.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:20:00):**  Those rock structures they initially built, they're still there but they're all invisible  
**[0:20:04-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:20:04):**  now because they're all covered with accumulated soil, organic matter and vegetation.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:20:09):**  So now the vegetation and that living soil is the structures.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:20:16):**  They've completely taken over and that's the goal is how do we collaborate with natural  
**[0:20:22-0:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:20:22):**  systems in a way that we just nudge them to take over and do far better than we could  
**[0:20:28-0:20:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:20:28):**  ourselves.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:20:29):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:20:30):**  Well, so on that note, let's focus on passive rain harvesting systems and elaborate on the  
**[0:20:36-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:20:36):**  term that you used earlier which is to plant the rain.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:20:39):**  Can you give me an idea of what it means to plant the rain and some ways that you can  
**[0:20:43-0:20:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:20:43):**  do it?  
**[0:20:44-0:20:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:20:44):**  Yeah.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:20:45):**  Well, think about how you plant a seed.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:20:47):**  You make a little hole in the ground, put the seed in there, cover it up.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:20:51):**  So we're doing the same thing.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:20:53):**  We're just not covering it up per se.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:20:56):**  So it's easiest to plant the rain in existing low spots where water is already accumulating.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:21:04):**  And if you've just got bare soil there, you're lacking a sponge.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:21:09):**  So you would want to add organic matter.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:21:13):**  You'd want to add seed.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:21:14):**  You'd want to add that life of those living pumps and do so in a way that its capacity  
**[0:21:24-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:21:24):**  is going to grow over time.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:21:25):**  You're going to get more organic matter that holds on to that moisture longer into the  
**[0:21:30-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:21:30):**  dry seasons and it has fertility and whatnot that's going to encourage more life, more  
**[0:21:36-0:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:21:36):**  living pumps, a wider network of roots and beneficial fungi, mycelium that link into  
**[0:21:43-0:21:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:21:43):**  those roots and distribute that water wider and further afield.  
**[0:21:50-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:21:50):**  There's been some great studies that have shown that if you plant the rain in a basin  
**[0:22:01-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:22:01):**  and are directing adjoining runoff to it, that's great.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:22:07):**  But you'll never reach the full capacity of the system, the full potential of the system  
**[0:22:13-0:22:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:22:13):**  if you don't encourage more of that life.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:22:16):**  So it's key to create the habitat, not just for the vegetation, but also that beneficial  
**[0:22:24-0:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:22:24):**  fungi.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:22:26):**  Because the web-like roots of the fungi, the mycelium, can infuse with the roots of the  
**[0:22:35-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:22:35):**  vegetation and expand the root area of that vegetation by hundreds of times, thereby dramatically  
**[0:22:44-0:22:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:22:44):**  increasing that life's ability to uptake and redistribute and cycle that water you've captured  
**[0:22:54-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:22:54):**  in that low spot in that basin.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:22:58):**  So the other key thing I find with this planting of the rain is it makes it much easier for  
**[0:23:11-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:23:11):**  life to get a foothold and to take off without my intervention once I've created that basin,  
**[0:23:20-0:23:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:23:20):**  that planting of the rain.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:23:22):**  There's plenty of advantages if I stay connected and I help maintain the system.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:23:27):**  But if I design it well, it can largely maintain itself without me.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:23:34):**  So in our neighborhood, we have created a lot of street side and in-street basins.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:23:43):**  When they're in the street, they're incorporated into water harvesting traffic calming features  
**[0:23:48-0:23:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:23:48):**  like roundabouts and intersections that are lower than the street and we direct the street  
**[0:23:53-0:23:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:23:53):**  runoff into the basin.  
**[0:23:56-0:24:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:23:56):**  On the street side, we come out into the street, constricting the street with itself to slow  
**[0:24:04-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:24:04):**  down traffic with what we call chicanes or pullouts.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:24:08):**  And they too, within the curb, are lower than the street.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:24:13):**  We direct street runoff to them.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:24:15):**  So in these systems, we got a grant through the city and the county to create these, get  
**[0:24:24-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:24:24):**  them permitted and approved through the city.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:24:27):**  But there wasn't that much money for landscaping.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:24:31):**  So we planted what there's budget for.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:24:35):**  But then a number of volunteers from our neighborhood forestry effort, we came in with the seed  
**[0:24:43-0:24:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:24:43):**  of native plants that we felt would thrive in the various microclimates of these water  
**[0:24:49-0:24:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:24:49):**  harvesting traffic calming structures throughout our neighborhood streets.  
**[0:24:53-0:25:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:24:53):**  And we would do this just before the rainy season started or just as the rainy season  
**[0:25:01-0:25:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:25:01):**  was starting.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:25:02):**  We have two rainy seasons in our area.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:25:05):**  And it was great because we never had to water that seed.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:25:10):**  The passively harvested water in these earthworks, that would provide enough water.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:25:16):**  And if the rains were late, no problem.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:25:18):**  Nothing germinates until the rains come.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:25:21):**  And then the plants came up and we never had to supplementarily irrigate because they grew  
**[0:25:27-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:25:27):**  from seed to begin with.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:25:29):**  So their growth rate wasn't abnormal as it would be in a pampered plant nursery.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:25:38):**  So it's been a very inexpensive way to revegetate.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:25:45):**  And not everything makes it.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:25:47):**  So we also learn, okay, well, what species are good, what aren't.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:25:53):**  And the awesome thing too is we're getting things like the coyote gourd, which grows.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:25:57):**  It's got a large tuberous root and spreading vine-like growth atop the ground and over  
**[0:26:05-0:26:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:26:05):**  other plants.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:26:06):**  And it has these wonderful gourds, which we use as seed grenades.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:26:10):**  So when the gourds mature and dry out, we make a little hole in it, fill seeds of other  
**[0:26:15-0:26:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:26:15):**  plants.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:26:16):**  And then we can germinate and then we can huck them into other water harvesting traffic  
**[0:26:21-0:26:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:26:21):**  calming earthworks or rain gardens and stuff errupts.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:26:27):**  So yeah, living grenades.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:26:31):**  Beneficial grenades.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:26:32):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:26:33):**  It's important to make that distinction, not just lobbing grenades into abandoned lots.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:26:40):**  So tell me about some of the ways that you've learned to read the landscape anywhere that  
**[0:26:45-0:26:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:26:45):**  you are in order to help make informed decisions about how to intervene in a positive way.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:26:50):**  You talked about sort of making those basins that hold water and give it sort of the kickstart  
**[0:26:56-0:27:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:26:56):**  that life needs to start to expand and nature to take over.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:27:00):**  But knowing where to put those is important.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:27:02):**  Like you mentioned, you had identified an arroyo in that client's land that indicated  
**[0:27:09-0:27:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:27:09):**  that there was going to be a stream of water in the right time of year.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:27:13):**  What other things do you look for to kind of give you clues as to what sort of interventions  
**[0:27:18-0:27:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:27:18):**  are going to be effective?  
**[0:27:19-0:27:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:27:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:27:20):**  So I'm definitely looking for the type of vegetation that's growing and where and its  
**[0:27:25-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:27:25):**  health.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:27:27):**  So there are many species that will clue you into areas that are better watered or more  
**[0:27:36-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:27:36):**  drained.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:27:38):**  And so I seek those out, but both the rich spots and the poor spots.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:27:46):**  And then I just start to ask, well, why are they this way?  
**[0:27:51-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:27:51):**  And I then try and look for anomalies like where in the heavily drained areas, the drier,  
**[0:28:01-0:28:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:28:01):**  more dehydrated areas with poorer soils, where is there an exception?  
**[0:28:07-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:28:07):**  Where is there more life, greater diversity, more soil and fertility?  
**[0:28:13-0:28:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:28:13):**  And what enabled that change?  
**[0:28:16-0:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:28:16):**  And oftentimes it's a speed hump in the flow, a contour speed hump that's slowing the draining  
**[0:28:26-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:28:26):**  pulled by gravity of water, soil, and seed.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:28:30):**  And it's allowing, it's instead created a net that has slowed that downward migration  
**[0:28:39-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:28:39):**  and enabled things to set and spread.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:28:49):**  And in best conditions, that net isn't just stable, it grows.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:28:56):**  And so then I try and look, well, how is it growing?  
**[0:29:01-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:29:01):**  Is it vegetation that's growing within and on its periphery that's growing that?  
**[0:29:06-0:29:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:29:06):**  Is it more detritus being caught and what's enabling the capture of that detritus and  
**[0:29:14-0:29:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:29:14):**  so on?  
**[0:29:15-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:29:15):**  And in the wetter areas, the more productive areas, I'm looking for anomalies there too.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:29:23):**  Like, well, where is it even more rich or where is it even starting to degrade and why?  
**[0:29:32-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:29:32):**  And then I try and build on what I see as reasons for positive evolutions.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:29:45):**  And I'm also always looking for, well, what were those acts of disturbance that started  
**[0:29:54-0:30:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:29:54):**  a downward spiral and how have those been naturally checked out in nature?  
**[0:30:02-0:30:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:30:02):**  And how could I mimic or be informed by those stabilizations?  
**[0:30:13-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:30:13):**  And it's not just me going out and looking for this.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:30:17):**  I'm also always actively looking for mentors that have well-trained eyes who can help train  
**[0:30:27-0:30:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:30:27):**  mine.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:30:28):**  So Bill Ziedike has been phenomenal that way.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:30:32):**  He's definitely a water whisperer.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:30:34):**  And he's got lots of free publications that you can download, a great many of those available  
**[0:30:42-0:30:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:30:42):**  at the kiviracollition.org website.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:30:47):**  And to be able to walk the land with him has been incredible for my learning, as it was  
**[0:30:54-0:31:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:30:54):**  with Mr. Zephaniah Piri in Zimbabwe.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:31:00):**  And it's great to also create, to tap into a community of other practitioners.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:31:09):**  So yeah, there's lots of great people doing this.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:31:13):**  And we're all learning and trying to further evolve our understanding.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:31:19):**  And when we get out on the land together, it's great that we can say, hey, look, I'm  
**[0:31:23-0:31:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:31:23):**  seeing this.  
**[0:31:24-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:31:24):**  What are you seeing?  
**[0:31:26-0:31:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:31:26):**  And to bounce ideas off each other, to challenge each other.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:31:30):**  And even better when we have the time to even do some simple interventions of build some  
**[0:31:37-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:31:37):**  simple structures and design them together and strategize, well, why we're putting this  
**[0:31:43-0:31:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:31:43):**  rock here as opposed to there.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:31:46):**  And what flow of water and sediment are we trying to work with in this way?  
**[0:31:53-0:32:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:31:53):**  And how might we nudge it to be an even better collaboration with those observed patterns  
**[0:32:00-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:32:00):**  of water and sediment flow?  
**[0:32:02-0:32:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:32:02):**  Man, I'd love to be a fly on the wall when coalitions like that get together and kind  
**[0:32:07-0:32:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:32:07):**  of expand upon everyone else's observations and knowledge and ideas.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:32:12):**  Those are really fun to be a part of.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:32:16):**  Give me an idea of the increasing importance of water stewardship in areas that are not  
**[0:32:21-0:32:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:32:21):**  water deficient.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:32:22):**  I know we've been using up until now mostly the case of where you are in Tucson, Arizona,  
**[0:32:27-0:32:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:32:27):**  which is literally a desert.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:32:29):**  And it's in a very extreme that most people don't live in, but is a fantastic laboratory  
**[0:32:35-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:32:35):**  as to with these extreme conditions, figuring out what works.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:32:39):**  But water scarcity is becoming an issue even in areas that get plenty of rainfall and not  
**[0:32:46-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:32:46):**  working with these passive solutions like you talked about is becoming more and more  
**[0:32:52-0:32:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:32:52):**  of a problem.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:32:53):**  Can you give me some ideas of where water wise stewardship is important for those areas?  
**[0:32:59-0:33:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:32:59):**  Sure.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:33:00):**  Yeah, I've had a number of readers of my books write to me and tell me what a great thing  
**[0:33:11-0:33:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:33:11):**  the knowledge in my books were for them.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:33:15):**  Because while they're surrounded by water in Louisiana, in the United States, a very  
**[0:33:22-0:33:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:33:22):**  wet, humid climate, because of our mistreatment of the watershed and great deals of pollution,  
**[0:33:34-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:33:34):**  the vast majority of that water that surrounds them is not safe to use.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:33:41):**  So they've been implementing a lot of these strategies, both active and passive, to capture  
**[0:33:49-0:34:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:33:49):**  cleaner roof runoff and with an active tank system, and then use living passive systems  
**[0:34:00-0:34:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:34:00):**  to help bio-remediate and filter the contaminated water on the ground surface.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:34:09):**  And both strategies are also helping reduce downstream flooding risk.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:34:16):**  So this is very common, this potential.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:34:21):**  And I had the chance to interact with and learn from colleagues in South Korea.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:34:31):**  And Seoul, South Korea is a very wet city.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:34:35):**  And innovators there are pushing for this whole idea that every building that is built  
**[0:34:42-0:34:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:34:42):**  must have three water harvesting tanks within the building.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:34:50):**  One for me, one for you, and one for everybody.  
**[0:34:53-0:35:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:34:53):**  The idea being the one for me, well that's water I'm collecting to use however I want  
**[0:35:01-0:35:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:35:01):**  and or need.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:35:04):**  The one for you, well that's the water I'm collecting in a tank that is meant to be flood  
**[0:35:11-0:35:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:35:11):**  control so I don't flood you downstream.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:35:15):**  And the one for everybody, that third tank is to be reserved for in times of need.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:35:21):**  Should there be some kind of catastrophe, be it power goes out or there's extreme drought,  
**[0:35:32-0:35:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:35:32):**  there's fires, what have you, there is an on-site water reserve ready for whatever is  
**[0:35:38-0:35:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:35:38):**  needed and it's high quality water.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:35:41):**  So the thing we have to keep in mind is we are on a planet where life exists because  
**[0:35:51-0:35:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:35:51):**  of water.  
**[0:35:53-0:36:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:35:53):**  Water is the lubrication of exchange, enabling nutrients, information, fertility, whatnot  
**[0:36:01-0:36:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:36:01):**  to be transferred from one life or element to another.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:36:08):**  And we have a very limited amount of water on this planet, especially fresh water that's  
**[0:36:14-0:36:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:36:14):**  not salty or whatnot.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:36:17):**  Less than 3% of the water on the planet is fresh water and really only 1% of the water  
**[0:36:24-0:36:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:36:24):**  on the planet is accessible.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:36:27):**  But yet this planet does not run out of water because it's got all these incredible living  
**[0:36:35-0:36:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:36:35):**  systems that have evolved to further cycle, filter that water, myriad times.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:36:45):**  So that life does not degrade the quality of that water, it maintains or improves it.  
**[0:36:52-0:37:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:36:52):**  And we can make a limited supply of water seem far less limited the more we cycle it  
**[0:37:02-0:37:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:37:02):**  by mimicking or collaborating with the natural systems.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:37:06):**  And in wetter climates, you tend to just have far more cycling than you do in dry climates  
**[0:37:15-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:37:15):**  because there's a greater abundance of that water.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:37:19):**  So your vegetation in a wet climate is going to be larger and consume water at a much more  
**[0:37:26-0:37:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:37:26):**  rapid rate.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:37:27):**  When I say consume, I should really say cycle because it's going to pump that water up through  
**[0:37:31-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:37:31):**  it and then re-release that water, transpire that water back into the atmosphere.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:37:37):**  So in wet climates, you use the same strategies we do in conceptually as we do in dry climates,  
**[0:37:48-0:37:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:37:48):**  but you're using a wholly different plant palette.  
**[0:37:51-0:38:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:37:51):**  You're using one that is much more water, needy or adapted to your rainfall regime.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:38:04):**  And just to try and illustrate that, so when I create these rain gardens, these basins,  
**[0:38:11-0:38:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:38:11):**  within them I have three distinct microclimates or planting zones, rain garden planting zones.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:38:17):**  And you can check out my books on my website, illustrations of this.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:38:21):**  But on the bottom of the basin, you have what are the bottom zone plants.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:38:26):**  These are your most water needy, water tolerant plants.  
**[0:38:29-0:38:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:38:29):**  And then, and also your most cold tolerant because cold air will drain into this basin  
**[0:38:34-0:38:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:38:34):**  and pool in the bottom of the basin.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:38:37):**  Then on the terraces, the banks of your basin, midway between the bottom and the top, that's  
**[0:38:44-0:38:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:38:44):**  where I have a little bit less water adaptive and needed plantings.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:38:51):**  And then on the top, I have the most arid adapted, the least water needy, the least  
**[0:38:58-0:39:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:38:58):**  water tolerant plants.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:39:01):**  So the base of the plant stays high and dry.  
**[0:39:03-0:39:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:39:03):**  You don't have crown rot, but the roots can still access the water down in the lower zones.  
**[0:39:09-0:39:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:39:09):**  So I created this just by seeing how different plant types grow in my area and then just  
**[0:39:17-0:39:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:39:17):**  mimicking that.  
**[0:39:18-0:39:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:39:18):**  And I've created plant lists for people that haven't yet fully observed that.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:39:23):**  So they can just go to the list.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:39:25):**  And these are all on my website and my books on what plant goes where.  
**[0:39:30-0:39:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:39:30):**  And I've worked with others in other bioregions to create plant lists for those regions.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:39:35):**  And that's all on the plant section of my website.  
**[0:39:38-0:39:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:39:38):**  But when I was in Florida, it gets five times the rain that we do annually.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:39:43):**  And I'm in the swamps.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:39:46):**  It was amazing to see that they naturally in that ecosystem, you have those three distinct  
**[0:39:55-0:39:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:39:55):**  planting zones.  
**[0:39:56-0:40:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:39:56):**  So you've got the hardwood, the bulk of the hardwood trees growing at the top.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:40:02):**  And in the bottom, you've got another hardwood.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:40:05):**  You've got the swamp cypress.  
**[0:40:07-0:40:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:40:07):**  But all these other species.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:40:10):**  And then there's also a very rich terrace zone of plants.  
**[0:40:16-0:40:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:40:16):**  And I just loved it.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:40:18):**  It's like, man, I can go to any climate and I can find this pattern.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:40:23):**  And I just need to tap into what plants and what life likes to live where.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:40:29):**  Yeah, it's getting to know those patterns that really unlocks the things that you can  
**[0:40:33-0:40:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:40:33):**  rely upon even when you're in a place that you're not terribly familiar with.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:40:38):**  Along those lines, what are you most excited about on the forefront of water harvesting  
**[0:40:43-0:40:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:40:43):**  and management practices that perhaps is not yet widely known or practiced in what you  
**[0:40:49-0:40:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:40:49):**  found around in your studies?  
**[0:40:53-0:40:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:40:53):**  I'd say Bill Ziedike's work is some of what excites me the most right now.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:40:59):**  And outside of the real water freaks, I don't think it's that well known.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:41:07):**  And that might in part be because it is so subtle.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:41:11):**  So when it's done well, you don't even see it.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:41:17):**  Because the idea is not to celebrate the structure.  
**[0:41:24-0:41:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:41:24):**  The idea is to celebrate and encourage the response.  
**[0:41:29-0:41:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:41:29):**  And I think too often in our current societies, we're obsessed with the human built environment.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:41:38):**  What you can purchase, what you can obtain.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:41:43):**  And in fact, in an older edition of my second book, Rainwater Harvesting for Drylands and  
**[0:41:49-0:41:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:41:49):**  Beyond Volume 2, coming out of the permaculture world, I had been exposed to and was pretty  
**[0:41:58-0:42:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:41:58):**  enamored with what I would call more heroic but less effective systems such as gabions,  
**[0:42:06-0:42:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:42:06):**  which are these wire wrapped rock walls perpendicular to the flow of water in a drainage that create  
**[0:42:15-0:42:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:42:15):**  a wall.  
**[0:42:18-0:42:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:42:18):**  And they can be effective if built and maintained properly.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:42:24):**  But they create a waterfall, a sudden drop in elevation in the drainage that did not  
**[0:42:34-0:42:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:42:34):**  exist before they were built.  
**[0:42:36-0:42:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:42:36):**  And on the downstream side of that structure, you have the potential for erosion, which  
**[0:42:44-0:42:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:42:44):**  can even undermine the entire structure.  
**[0:42:47-0:42:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:42:47):**  Because as the water pours over the wall on the downstream side, water picks up speed  
**[0:42:52-0:42:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:42:52):**  as it's falling and creates a scour hole on the downstream side, which can eat under the  
**[0:42:57-0:43:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:42:57):**  structure itself and unravel the whole structure.  
**[0:43:03-0:43:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:43:03):**  So Bill Ziedike, he tends to use much more subtle interventions.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:43:11):**  So in that same place, instead of doing a high wall, he put in only one rock high structure  
**[0:43:20-0:43:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:43:20):**  that's many rocks wide.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:43:22):**  And instead of being wall shaped, it's very gradually speed hump shaped.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:43:29):**  So the structure itself is far less likely to increase the speed and the erosive capacity  
**[0:43:39-0:43:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:43:39):**  of the water.  
**[0:43:40-0:43:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:43:40):**  Instead, the structure is striving to further slow and spread the flow of water at all points,  
**[0:43:47-0:43:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:43:47):**  not just the upstream side, but the downstream side too.  
**[0:43:51-0:43:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:43:51):**  And you never build one of these alone.  
**[0:43:53-0:43:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:43:53):**  You always build them in a series.  
**[0:43:57-0:44:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:43:57):**  So you're having to keep in mind the nested holes in which you're placing this structure.  
**[0:44:06-0:44:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:44:06):**  And with these one rock dams, you seed before you place the rock.  
**[0:44:15-0:44:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:44:15):**  Because the whole intention is to grow vegetation through the structure that will further stabilize  
**[0:44:22-0:44:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:44:22):**  it and lock it in place, but will also take the place of the structure.  
**[0:44:27-0:44:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:44:27):**  Because as both the structure and the vegetation growing through it slows and spreads the flow  
**[0:44:32-0:44:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:44:32):**  of water, more sediment's going to drop out of the flow and accumulate.  
**[0:44:36-0:44:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:44:36):**  It's going to hold on to moisture longer.  
**[0:44:39-0:44:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:44:39):**  More seeds going to germinate.  
**[0:44:40-0:44:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:44:40):**  More vegetation is going to grow.  
**[0:44:42-0:44:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:44:42):**  And you're going to grow a structure, much like the wetlands I talked about earlier in  
**[0:44:49-0:44:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:44:49):**  our conversation outside Silver City, New Mexico, where Bill and Van had worked.  
**[0:44:54-0:45:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:44:54):**  And so you come back years later, and the structures are completely buried.  
**[0:45:01-0:45:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:45:01):**  No problem.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:45:03):**  What's important is they help set up the conditions where vegetation could grow, not only on top  
**[0:45:10-0:45:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:45:10):**  and just in adjoining the structure, but it could continue to grow between the structures.  
**[0:45:16-0:45:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:45:16):**  So you have continuous life that's doing a far better job of slowing, spreading, and  
**[0:45:22-0:45:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:45:22):**  sinking the flow of water, creating this living sponge, this soil carbon sponge, this sink,  
**[0:45:32-0:45:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:45:32):**  this net of fertility and cycling that just keeps building on itself over time.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:45:41):**  So that's what really excites me.  
**[0:45:45-0:45:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:45:45):**  And it also really fuels my awareness of and passion for the need to not just preserve,  
**[0:45:58-0:46:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:45:58):**  but learn from and help steward the sponges we already have in place, where we have springs  
**[0:46:08-0:46:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:46:08):**  and cienegas, wetlands, and so on.  
**[0:46:14-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:46:14):**  We can't keep mining from these, extracting from them, because we need them as our living  
**[0:46:21-0:46:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:46:21):**  encyclopedias, our living schools and teachers, where we can see what works and what does  
**[0:46:28-0:46:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:46:28):**  not work with or without us, so that they can inform better integrated systems.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:46:36):**  And what I'm getting from what you're talking about, too, is that some of these new or innovative  
**[0:46:41-0:46:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:46:41):**  systems are actually a lot more approachable for the average person.  
**[0:46:45-0:46:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:46:45):**  It's going to take a big team and possibly a fairly large budget to go in and put in  
**[0:46:48-0:46:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:46:48):**  a big dam structure, or whether it's a pond or other water retention feature on a large  
**[0:46:58-0:46:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:46:58):**  scale.  
**[0:46:59-0:47:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:46:59):**  But one of these single rock dams is something that maybe two or three people could do, or  
**[0:47:04-0:47:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:47:04):**  one person with a little bit of patience and a bit of understanding about how that ecosystem  
**[0:47:09-0:47:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:47:09):**  works and how water moves through that system.  
**[0:47:12-0:47:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:47:12):**  Oh, absolutely.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:47:15):**  They're much, much easier in terms of the build-out.  
**[0:47:19-0:47:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:47:19):**  But what is, to really be successful, you do need to spend more time observing and thinking  
**[0:47:29-0:47:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:47:29):**  about what's the right place for this.  
**[0:47:32-0:47:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:47:32):**  Because if you're just randomly putting it in, it can actually do more harm than good.  
**[0:47:38-0:47:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:47:38):**  So you need to spend more time learning the patterns that you're trying to work with,  
**[0:47:45-0:47:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:47:45):**  which is all very doable.  
**[0:47:47-0:47:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:47:47):**  But sometimes people just don't have the attention span or the will to learn that.  
**[0:47:53-0:47:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:47:53):**  And that's essential with these strategies.  
**[0:47:56-0:48:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:47:56):**  I would say, though, that is just as essential with the more resource-intensive strategies,  
**[0:48:05-0:48:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:48:05):**  but just as much.  
**[0:48:09-0:48:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:48:09):**  And I'd also say that with these simple one rock dams and so on, which can very easily  
**[0:48:15-0:48:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:48:15):**  be built by a single person, these, at that scale of easy build, are most appropriate  
**[0:48:24-0:48:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:48:24):**  in the smaller waterways, the tributaries, and where you've got a much heavier flow.  
**[0:48:35-0:48:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:48:35):**  And let's say you've got some severe erosion of a really big head cut.  
**[0:48:40-0:48:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:48:40):**  That may require coming in with a backhoe with a bucket and thumb to move much larger  
**[0:48:48-0:48:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:48:48):**  rock.  
**[0:48:49-0:48:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:48:49):**  You'd be using the same patterns and everything.  
**[0:48:52-0:48:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:48:52):**  It's just the scale would be moving up.  
**[0:48:55-0:48:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:48:55):**  That's the only difference, really.  
**[0:48:58-0:49:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:48:58):**  So in that case, more equipment, more resources would be needed.  
**[0:49:03-0:49:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:49:03):**  But it's all informed by the simpler, easier work you've done in the lower flow tributaries.  
**[0:49:10-0:49:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:49:10):**  And I find the best equipment operators are those that learned doing the handwork.  
**[0:49:19-0:49:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:49:19):**  Now they're just using the equipment as an extension of their hands and arms that tends  
**[0:49:25-0:49:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:49:25):**  to have bigger hydraulic biceps than their own.  
**[0:49:28-0:49:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:49:28):**  Yeah, I seem to see that pattern reflected in a lot of things.  
**[0:49:31-0:49:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:49:31):**  By doing it the simple old-fashioned or manual or analog way, whatever that is, is going  
**[0:49:35-0:49:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:49:35):**  to make you that much more effective and nuanced in your approach when you have larger resources  
**[0:49:41-0:49:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:49:41):**  and bigger equipment.  
**[0:49:42-0:49:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:49:42):**  Just like someone who has done every step of the process makes a better manager because  
**[0:49:46-0:49:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:49:46):**  they understand every step below them.  
**[0:49:48-0:49:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:49:48):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:49:50-0:50:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:49:50):**  And just to reiterate, too, these same simple strategies, approaches within waterways work  
**[0:50:00-0:50:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:50:00):**  great on roads.  
**[0:50:01-0:50:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:50:01):**  So in the rural setting or even in the urban setting with dirt driveways, when you've got  
**[0:50:07-0:50:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:50:07):**  a dirt road or dirt driveway, these tend to be the most erosive parts of the landscape  
**[0:50:14-0:50:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:50:14):**  because there's no anchoring vegetation where you've got vehicles driving.  
**[0:50:18-0:50:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:50:18):**  So there's a number of really simple strategies that I've got in my books that redirect that  
**[0:50:27-0:50:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:50:27):**  work off the road into adjoining planting areas.  
**[0:50:30-0:50:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:50:30):**  And I've got some great stories of how a local ranch here really upped the capacity and yeah,  
**[0:50:41-0:50:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:50:41):**  the growth in the pastures and the feed for their livestock and wildlife by literally  
**[0:50:48-0:50:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:50:48):**  harvesting the rainwater off the dirt roads and spreading it out in adjoining pasture.  
**[0:50:57-0:51:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:50:57):**  Which sounds like a no-brainer and it should be.  
**[0:51:01-0:51:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:51:01):**  But what's key is to strategize where you release the water into the pasture so you're  
**[0:51:06-0:51:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:51:06):**  choosing the least steep area where the natural landform is most likely to spread the water  
**[0:51:13-0:51:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:51:13):**  out for you.  
**[0:51:14-0:51:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:51:14):**  Bill Ziedyke says there's a couple of simple principles he uses.  
**[0:51:19-0:51:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:51:19):**  You want to drain a road your first chance.  
**[0:51:23-0:51:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:51:23):**  So immediately start draining water off the road because water doesn't do any good on  
**[0:51:26-0:51:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:51:26):**  a road.  
**[0:51:28-0:51:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:51:28):**  The next principle is you want to use your best chance.  
**[0:51:33-0:51:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:51:33):**  So that's stepping up the game.  
**[0:51:35-0:51:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:51:35):**  Instead of just draining the road, you're trying to drain the road to where the drained  
**[0:51:40-0:51:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:51:40):**  water is going to serve the most good.  
**[0:51:42-0:51:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:51:42):**  Where is it going to slow down and spread out the most to grow more life adjoining that  
**[0:51:46-0:51:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:51:46):**  road as opposed to shooting it off at the supposedly easiest spot onto a steep slope  
**[0:51:52-0:51:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:51:52):**  which is just going to create a head cut that's eventually going to erode the road.  
**[0:51:56-0:52:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:51:56):**  Okay and then you want to make sure you divert water off the road at your last chance.  
**[0:52:04-0:52:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:52:04):**  You know before the road enters an area where it is lower than the adjoining landscape.  
**[0:52:12-0:52:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:52:12):**  So you want to drain whatever water you can off before there's no longer a chance to drain  
**[0:52:18-0:52:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:52:18):**  that water.  
**[0:52:19-0:52:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:52:19):**  You know it's all just simple stuff but I carry these principles in my head like a little  
**[0:52:24-0:52:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:52:24):**  mantra reminder.  
**[0:52:25-0:52:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:52:25):**  Because I do my other water harvesting principles.  
**[0:52:30-0:52:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:52:30):**  The eight basic principles and then in the latest editions of my books, especially volume  
**[0:52:36-0:52:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:52:36):**  two, I've created a whole number of principles for water harvesting structures within waterways.  
**[0:52:45-0:52:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:52:45):**  And they're all just like reminders of, hey did you think of this?  
**[0:52:48-0:52:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:52:48):**  Hey don't forget this important point.  
**[0:52:52-0:52:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:52:52):**  And so I don't forget what should be obvious but is forgotten.  
**[0:52:58-0:53:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:52:58):**  So I'm more likely to succeed and less likely to fail.  
**[0:53:02-0:53:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:53:02):**  Yeah that's such a good principle and I know you're using the example of harvesting water  
**[0:53:06-0:53:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:53:06):**  off of a road in a rural area but your examples of doing so in urban areas, especially for  
**[0:53:12-0:53:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:53:12):**  people who live in a dry land context like yours and think that they don't have enough  
**[0:53:16-0:53:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:53:16):**  of a catchment area to be able to gather enough water to make any meaningful difference is  
**[0:53:22-0:53:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:53:22):**  that you said that if you can tap into the runoff from roads especially or any other  
**[0:53:27-0:53:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:53:27):**  paved over structure that's not infiltrating, you can expand the area from which you're  
**[0:53:33-0:53:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:53:33):**  harvesting from by like 10 times or more.  
**[0:53:36-0:53:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:53:36):**  Oh yeah and you can increase the available rainfall by 10 times or more.  
**[0:53:41-0:53:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:53:41):**  So I've had the chance to go to even drier areas like Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.  
**[0:53:58-0:54:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:53:58):**  So there they only get two and a half inches of rain a year and yet there is a rich history  
**[0:54:05-0:54:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:54:05):**  of water harvesting throughout the region because before the time, the recent time of  
**[0:54:13-0:54:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:54:13):**  mechanical pumps, people were entirely reliant upon harvested rainwater in these dry climates.  
**[0:54:22-0:54:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:54:22):**  So they made the most of it.  
**[0:54:24-0:54:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:54:24):**  They made the most of every drop that fell.  
**[0:54:27-0:54:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:54:27):**  So the drier your climate, the more important it is to harvest water and on the reverse  
**[0:54:32-0:54:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:54:32):**  I could say the wetter your climate, the more important it is to harvest water and cycle  
**[0:54:37-0:54:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:54:37):**  it because water harvesting as I advocate it buffers all extremes.  
**[0:54:45-0:54:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:54:45):**  It buffers the droughts.  
**[0:54:47-0:54:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:54:47):**  It reduces the time of drought.  
**[0:54:49-0:54:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:54:49):**  It buffers floods.  
**[0:54:50-0:54:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:54:50):**  It reduces the time and the severity of drought of flooding.  
**[0:54:57-0:54:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:54:57):**  So all that is key.  
**[0:54:59-0:55:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:54:59):**  And here in my dry community of Tucson and this being the summer being a record year  
**[0:55:05-0:55:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:55:05):**  of drought and heat, we only got one good rain this summer.  
**[0:55:12-0:55:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:55:12):**  We usually get at least a dozen.  
**[0:55:15-0:55:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:55:15):**  We only got one.  
**[0:55:17-0:55:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:55:17):**  And when I say good rain, I mean that there's enough rain that we get a good amount of runoff.  
**[0:55:25-0:55:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:55:25):**  So we only had one of those.  
**[0:55:27-0:55:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:55:27):**  Nonetheless, where people, myself and some neighbors included, set up water harvesting  
**[0:55:36-0:55:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:55:36):**  earthworks to capture the runoff off the street and other surfaces, those filled in that one  
**[0:55:47-0:55:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:55:47):**  rain event.  
**[0:55:49-0:55:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:55:49):**  Whereas neighbors that were not doing any harvest of water, everything rapidly drained  
**[0:55:57-0:55:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:55:57):**  away and evaporated out.  
**[0:55:59-0:56:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:55:59):**  And their plants still look desiccated.  
**[0:56:04-0:56:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:56:04):**  Whereas those of us who created these water harvesting structures and captured the rain  
**[0:56:12-0:56:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:56:12):**  the one time it fell this summer, everything's looking great.  
**[0:56:18-0:56:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:56:18):**  Now of course, you could also go to a neighbor who's not doing any water harvesting but is  
**[0:56:22-0:56:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:56:22):**  pumping city water and irrigating.  
**[0:56:25-0:56:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:56:25):**  Well that doesn't, I don't look at those.  
**[0:56:28-0:56:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:56:28):**  That's not a natural system.  
**[0:56:31-0:56:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:56:31):**  That's not informing me of anything.  
**[0:56:34-0:56:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:56:34):**  But looking at the comparing the systems where folks are not bringing in any outside water.  
**[0:56:42-0:56:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:56:42):**  The system is just reliant upon what's there.  
**[0:56:46-0:56:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:56:46):**  It's very dramatic to see the difference.  
**[0:56:51-0:56:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:56:51):**  And it's seeing that difference, that's what really juices me and sparks me to continue  
**[0:56:57-0:56:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:56:57):**  this work.  
**[0:56:58-0:57:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:56:58):**  Because with climate change getting worse and it's very frustrating for me to see how  
**[0:57:10-0:57:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:57:10):**  temporal our thinking is.  
**[0:57:12-0:57:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:57:12):**  How we seem to respond to what seems to be the most immediate urgency and too often let  
**[0:57:24-0:57:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:57:24):**  climate change resiliency, we let that go and instead are dressing with something else  
**[0:57:30-0:57:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:57:30):**  before us.  
**[0:57:31-0:57:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:57:31):**  Which yeah, politics, whatever.  
**[0:57:34-0:57:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:57:34):**  But we should be looking at climate change in terms of politics.  
**[0:57:36-0:57:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:57:36):**  Okay, I'm not going to go down that vent spiral.  
**[0:57:40-0:57:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:57:40):**  We'll do that in another episode.  
**[0:57:42-0:57:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:57:42):**  But the key thing I want to say here, the juicing thing, the life affirming thing is  
**[0:57:51-0:57:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:57:51):**  it's very apparent to me to see the response to what we're doing around here.  
**[0:57:58-0:58:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:57:58):**  Right now with work that you can do in a matter of hours, you can have a big effect on buffering  
**[0:58:06-0:58:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:58:06):**  our climate extremes.  
**[0:58:10-0:58:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:58:10):**  So with the very simple work we did with hand tools and neighbors, we have oasis spots that  
**[0:58:18-0:58:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:58:18):**  are still hydrated, they're shaded, they're much cooler, they have greater density of  
**[0:58:23-0:58:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:58:23):**  wildlife habitat and we're producing wild native foods where we're harvesting the water  
**[0:58:29-0:58:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:58:29):**  and the soil has got more organic matter.  
**[0:58:33-0:58:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:58:33):**  The soil profile is deeper, it's richer, there's far more life within it.  
**[0:58:40-0:58:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:58:40):**  And when you compare to the drained areas, which are desiccated and they're hotter and  
**[0:58:46-0:58:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:58:46):**  they're unraveling.  
**[0:58:48-0:58:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:58:48):**  So there's so much we can do so easily.  
**[0:58:55-0:59:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:58:55):**  And the great thing is you don't have to leave home to see examples of this if you know how  
**[0:59:02-0:59:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:59:02):**  to look.  
**[0:59:03-0:59:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:59:03):**  And on those wonderful worlds of inspiration, Brad, could you tell us where people can find  
**[0:59:10-0:59:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:59:10):**  the resources that you have at the harvestingrainwater.com, the two books that you have in new editions  
**[0:59:16-0:59:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:59:16):**  and some of the other projects that you're working on where they can find some examples  
**[0:59:21-0:59:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:59:21):**  of what you're talking about?  
**[0:59:22-0:59:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:59:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:59:23-0:59:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:59:23):**  So, well, I just mentioned at the end there that if you just know how to look, that is  
**[0:59:28-0:59:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:59:28):**  a major focus of my books, my teaching, my workshops is enabling us to see in new ways  
**[0:59:35-0:59:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:59:35):**  and then to act upon that scene.  
**[0:59:38-0:59:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:59:38):**  So you can get my books at my website harvestingrainwater.com and you can get it anywhere books are sold.  
**[0:59:47-0:59:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:59:47):**  But it's especially great for me and the whole effort if you can buy direct from me because  
**[0:59:53-0:59:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:59:53):**  that way there's no middle person taking a cut.  
**[0:59:57-1:00:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:59:57):**  And I'm able to direct more resources to the generation of more books, more free resources  
**[1:00:04-1:00:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:00:04):**  I put up on my website and so on.  
**[1:00:06-1:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:00:06):**  So again harvestingrainwater.com is the place.  
**[1:00:09-1:00:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:00:09):**  The title of the books are Rainwater Harvesting for Drylands and Beyond Volumes 1 and 2.  
**[1:00:16-1:00:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:00:16):**  And I recently came out with brand new expanded revised full color editions.  
**[1:00:23-1:00:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:00:23):**  So I highly recommend you get those as opposed to the old editions because I've made a dramatic  
**[1:00:30-1:00:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:00:30):**  amount of significant changes.  
**[1:00:32-1:00:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:00:32):**  I've removed strategies I no longer can stand behind and have brought in a lot more, for  
**[1:00:39-1:00:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:00:39):**  example, the ZDyke inspired strategies that I find are exemplary.  
**[1:00:46-1:00:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:00:46):**  And there's plenty of free resources on my website, including plant lists for different  
**[1:00:52-1:01:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:00:52):**  bioregions, lots of image galleries and videos for rainwater rooftop systems, street runoff  
**[1:01:00-1:01:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:01:00):**  harvesting, greywater harvesting systems, air conditioning condensate harvesting, systems  
**[1:01:07-1:01:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:01:07):**  on fertility like compost toilet systems and so on.  
**[1:01:11-1:01:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:01:11):**  And so check all those out.  
**[1:01:15-1:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:01:15):**  And a new, well it's not a new effort.  
**[1:01:18-1:01:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:01:18):**  It's just a new branding of a long time effort, is check out my neighborhood forestry work.  
**[1:01:27-1:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:01:27):**  So if you go to DunbarSpringNeighborhoodForrestors.org, again DunbarSpringNeighborhoodForrestors.org,  
**[1:01:37-1:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:01:37):**  that's the website for the neighborhood forestry effort that I'm doing within my neighborhood.  
**[1:01:44-1:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:01:44):**  But we've set up the website and all the templates and the tools so that any neighborhood anywhere  
**[1:01:51-1:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:01:51):**  can use them.  
**[1:01:55-1:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:01:55):**  So yeah, check that out as well.  
**[1:01:56-1:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:01:56):**  And another effort where we've got a great cookbook on Sonoran Desert, wild foods, how  
**[1:02:05-1:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:02:05):**  you can grow them, steward them, harvest them, process them.  
**[1:02:10-1:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:02:10):**  The cookbook being Eat Mosquitoes More.  
**[1:02:12-1:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:02:12):**  It's available at DesertHarvesters.org.  
**[1:02:15-1:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:02:15):**  And even if you're from another bioregion, again, that can be a great template for your  
**[1:02:20-1:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:02:20):**  region because you can open up the book to any month of the year and see, oh, well, what's  
**[1:02:26-1:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:02:26):**  harvestable or plantable at this time of the year and gives you all the steps.  
**[1:02:33-1:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:02:33):**  And yeah, there's plenty more, but that's the main stuff on the table right now.  
**[1:02:40-1:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:02:40):**  And oh, I'll just mention too.  
**[1:02:41-1:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:02:41):**  I'm also really into live storytelling.  
**[1:02:43-1:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:02:43):**  That's all been put on hold with COVID at the moment.  
**[1:02:46-1:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:02:46):**  But you can check out the storytelling page on my website, HarvestingRainwater.com.  
**[1:02:52-1:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:02:52):**  Yeah, that is a good list of resources.  
**[1:02:56-1:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:02:56):**  I've checked out the storytelling event that you guys do, and it's really engaging.  
**[1:03:01-1:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:03:01):**  It's kind of along the lines of The Moth or other people who listen to podcasts like that  
**[1:03:06-1:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:03:06):**  and enjoy live storytelling.  
**[1:03:08-1:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:03:08):**  It's a really good resource.  
**[1:03:10-1:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:03:10):**  I'll be sure to put all the links for this on the show notes for this episode on the  
**[1:03:13-1:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:03:13):**  website.  
**[1:03:15-1:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:03:15):**  And Brad, it's been a real pleasure to talk to you.  
**[1:03:17-1:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:03:17):**  I've gotten so much out of the body of work that you've published online and the educational  
**[1:03:21-1:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:03:21):**  resources that you've put out there have helped me a ton in giving solid advice and direction  
**[1:03:27-1:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:03:27):**  to my clients, as well as informing the projects that I've done around the world as well.  
**[1:03:32-1:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:03:32):**  So I really want to thank you for that.  
**[1:03:34-1:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:03:34):**  And I look forward to continuing to follow your work and hopefully doing another episode  
**[1:03:40-1:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:03:40):**  like this in the future.  
**[1:03:42-1:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:03:42):**  That'd be great.  
**[1:03:43-1:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:03:43):**  I'd love it.  
**[1:03:44-1:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:03:44):**  And again, thanks for the opportunity.  
**[1:03:46-1:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:03:46):**  And I just remembered a couple of the things I want to share with you all.  
**[1:03:50-1:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:03:50):**  By all means.  
**[1:03:51-1:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:03:51):**  That I'm working on.  
**[1:03:52-1:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:03:52):**  So because international shipping is crazy expensive, for some the books can seem not  
**[1:04:02-1:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:04:02):**  so accessible.  
**[1:04:04-1:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:04:04):**  That's why I've now got an ebook edition of my first book, Rainwater Harvesting for Dry  
**[1:04:09-1:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:04:09):**  Lands and Beyond.  
**[1:04:10-1:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:04:10):**  So there's no shipping cost.  
**[1:04:13-1:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:04:13):**  And the awesome thing about it is you can have it on your phone at any time.  
**[1:04:17-1:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:04:17):**  And I found it great for using with clients and stuff.  
**[1:04:20-1:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:04:20):**  I can pull up imagery of what I'm talking about at any point, show them a case study,  
**[1:04:25-1:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:04:25):**  show them a calculation so we can figure out how much water they'll harvest and how many  
**[1:04:29-1:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:04:29):**  plants that'll support.  
**[1:04:33-1:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:04:33):**  And I am currently working on an ebook edition of Volume 2.  
**[1:04:37-1:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:04:37):**  I hope to have that out in November.  
**[1:04:40-1:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:04:40):**  Check the website for updates on that.  
**[1:04:42-1:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:04:42):**  And also I'm currently working on a Spanish edition of my first book.  
**[1:04:47-1:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:04:47):**  So we're halfway through the translation.  
**[1:04:52-1:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:04:52):**  We hope to have the translation wrapped up by the end of 2020.  
**[1:04:57-1:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:04:57):**  And we'll release that in digital ebook form.  
**[1:05:02-1:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:05:02):**  Really early in the new year.  
**[1:05:04-1:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:05:04):**  Oh, excellent.  
**[1:05:05-1:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:05:05):**  Yeah, I can't wait for that.  
**[1:05:07-1:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:05:07):**  I've been looking for a Spanish resource like that to bring over to Spain here with some  
**[1:05:11-1:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:05:11):**  of my work and some of the courses that I'm hoping to launch in the upcoming year.  
**[1:05:15-1:05:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:05:15):**  So definitely keep me informed when that one comes out.  
**[1:05:18-1:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:05:18):**  Yeah, you bet.  
**[1:05:19-1:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:05:19):**  All right.  
**[1:05:20-1:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:05:20):**  Well, thank you so much, Brad.  
**[1:05:21-1:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:05:21):**  And I look forward to catching up with you again soon.  
**[1:05:22-1:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:05:22):**  All right.  
**[1:05:23-1:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:05:23):**  Well, thanks again.  
**[1:05:25-1:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:05:25):**  All right.  
**[1:05:26-1:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:05:26):**  That wraps things up for this week's episode.  
**[1:05:29-1:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:05:29):**  If you enjoyed this interview and want to find more like it, as well as articles and  
**[1:05:32-1:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:05:32):**  other resources, you can find the full library of previous podcasts at abundantedge.com.  
**[1:05:38-1:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:05:38):**  The best part is that you can search by category, topics, or keywords on our brand new website  
**[1:05:42-1:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:05:42):**  rather than scrolling through more than 140 interviews.  
**[1:05:46-1:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:05:46):**  I've spoken to experts on everything from growing your own food, building homes from

**[0:02:52-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:02:52):**  the breadth of factors in calculating the emissions impact of a community, the various  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:02:57):**  technologies needed for a resilient system throughout the entire year, and strategic  
**[0:03:02-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:03:02):**  financial planning in the long term to reach goals that are out of reach at the beginning.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:03:08):**  We also dive deep into the community organization aspects, which are essential to success, like  
**[0:03:13-0:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:03:13):**  gaining the trust of local residents, bringing together people from various sectors, managing  
**[0:03:18-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:03:18):**  expectations, and including diverse voices in each level of decision-making.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:03:23):**  I especially recommend sticking around to the end of the interview, when Taryn gives  
**[0:03:27-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:03:27):**  her advice for people looking to start similar initiatives in their own communities and where  
**[0:03:32-0:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:03:32):**  they can find tools and resources to get them started.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:03:35):**  So with that said and out of the way, let's hand things over to Taryn Lane.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:03:40):**  Taryn, let's start from the beginning.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:03:44):**  How did you get started to work in renewable energy, especially at a community scale?  
**[0:03:49-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:03:49):**  So my background is in international development.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:03:54):**  I would say I'm a community development practitioner rather than being an engineer or something  
**[0:03:59-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:03:59):**  similar.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:04:00):**  But around about 12 years ago, I was lucky enough to meet the volunteer board and the  
**[0:04:06-0:04:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:04:06):**  founders of what was to become Australia's first community-owned wind farm.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:04:11):**  So this was before the project was up and operating.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:04:15):**  And they, I guess, saw the need to have a staff member who could play a role in regards  
**[0:04:22-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:04:22):**  to engaging the community, raising capital, and dealing with some of the complexities  
**[0:04:28-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:04:28):**  that were there in regards to opposition against renewables.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:04:31):**  You know, 12 years ago, there was quite a lot of opposition in the local area.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:04:36):**  And to work out what our benefit sharing model might be in the community.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:04:40):**  So to essentially develop something that could really support the community over the years.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:04:48):**  So that was the original role way back then, about 12 years ago.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:04:53):**  And yeah, I'm very grateful that I'm still working for my local energy cooperative.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:04:58):**  We've now been generating for 10 years, generating enough power for around 2000 homes.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:05:06):**  And yeah, we have a lot of plans to sort of grow our impact and already growing our impact  
**[0:05:11-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:05:11):**  in the local area as well.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:05:13):**  That is amazing.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:05:14):**  And this has developed into a much larger project.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:05:17):**  And I'm sure you probably had an idea of the scope of in the beginning.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:05:21):**  Can you break down what Hepburn Shire ZNet is?  
**[0:05:26-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:05:26):**  And perhaps some of the examples in how it is assisting renewable energy transitions  
**[0:05:31-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:05:31):**  within that community?  
**[0:05:33-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:05:33):**  Sure.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:05:34):**  So look, I guess, originally, the intention was always to build a wind farm that was appropriately  
**[0:05:43-0:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:05:43):**  scaled to the local energy needs of two sort of local towns that are very close to where  
**[0:05:50-0:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:05:50):**  the wind farm is located.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:05:52):**  So it was very much that sort of townscale approach.  
**[0:05:55-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:05:55):**  And so we were able to achieve that and to become the first example of a zero net energy  
**[0:06:01-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:06:01):**  village in Australia.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:06:03):**  And we still are the only operating one.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:06:06):**  But over the years, I guess we talked about having a bigger ambition and reaching 100%  
**[0:06:13-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:06:13):**  renewables across our whole Shire.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:06:15):**  And our Shire has around about 15,000 people, a large geographic footprint, because out  
**[0:06:22-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:06:22):**  in Australia, there can be a lot of space and not that much population.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:06:25):**  So a fairly large geographical footprint, 15,000 people and about six and a half thousand  
**[0:06:30-0:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:06:30):**  homes.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:06:31):**  And we're located about an hour and a half northwest of Melbourne.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:06:35):**  So very much in regional Victoria.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:06:37):**  So the ambition was, OK, could we go further than the village scale and look at our entire  
**[0:06:44-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:06:44):**  Shire?  
**[0:06:45-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:06:45):**  And if we're going to look at energy, should we also be looking at other elements such  
**[0:06:52-0:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:06:52):**  as transport, waste, industry and agriculture and land use and look at the full emissions  
**[0:07:00-0:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:07:00):**  spectrum?  
**[0:07:02-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:07:02):**  And I was lucky enough to be awarded what's called a Churchill Fellowship, a research  
**[0:07:06-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:07:06):**  fellowship in 2016.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:07:08):**  So I went to Europe with the intent to sort of look into different models of how this  
**[0:07:14-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:07:14):**  could be achieved and then came back and yeah, we were able to secure some funding to basically  
**[0:07:21-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:07:21):**  pilot this in the Australian context.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:07:24):**  And that occurred in 2018.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:07:26):**  And so, yeah, we did basically a very bottom up approach to how you could do this in a  
**[0:07:31-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:07:31):**  place based way and got lots of data inputs from the community, got harvested, I think  
**[0:07:36-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:07:36):**  over 90 kind of project ideas from the community and then did a lot of rigorous technical model  
**[0:07:42-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:07:42):**  so that we could really see the trajectory of where we are now.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:07:45):**  What happens if we just kind of go ahead as business as usual?  
**[0:07:49-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:07:49):**  And what happens if we really target all the emission sectors and really try and make a  
**[0:07:55-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:07:55):**  difference?  
**[0:07:56-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:07:56):**  So, yes, we've been on that journey since 2019.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:08:00):**  We released our roadmap.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:08:01):**  So we've been kind of three years into the implementation phase.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:08:05):**  It is a 10 year plan.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:08:07):**  So we're aiming to achieve a zero net emissions by 2030.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:08:12):**  And we have a range of programs and projects that we've been working on.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:08:16):**  So not just from the Hepburn wind perspective, but lots of other community groups, our local  
**[0:08:21-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:08:21):**  council and lots of kind of regional partners that we've been pulling in to help us achieve  
**[0:08:27-0:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:08:27):**  these ambitions.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:08:28):**  So I guess some examples of projects would be bog buys.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:08:32):**  We do a lot of bulk purchasing.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:08:35):**  So heat pump, hot water, bog buys, residential solar battery, electric vehicle, second hand  
**[0:08:43-0:08:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:08:43):**  electric vehicle bog buys.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:08:46):**  We've got a project for electric vehicle charging infrastructure, energy audits.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:08:54):**  And then there's a bunch that kind of target some of the other sectors like agriculture,  
**[0:08:58-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:08:58):**  which are sort of more emergent.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:09:01):**  So that stuff is more around raising awareness.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:09:04):**  We have a guide, for example, for how farmers can reach net zero emissions on farm and the  
**[0:09:09-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:09:09):**  types of programs that might get them there.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:09:13):**  And likewise, there's an emergent sort of agroforestry project that's looking at carbon  
**[0:09:16-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:09:16):**  sequestration and community woodlots.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:09:19):**  Yeah, so we're really trying to work with the community to have all these different  
**[0:09:24-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:09:24):**  touch points that are either delivering projects and programs that are reducing emissions now,  
**[0:09:31-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:09:31):**  or they're kind of setting up the conditions so that we can see projects and programs into  
**[0:09:36-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:09:36):**  the future.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:09:37):**  And this really is a very broad scope project.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:09:41):**  Very broad.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:09:42):**  I'd like to go back to the beginning here and hear a bit about how this project first  
**[0:09:47-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:09:47):**  got brought up to the community over a decade ago, especially when two were mentioning that  
**[0:09:53-0:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:09:53):**  this is something that wasn't nearly as well known or popular at the time.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:09:58):**  And what were the key steps that got people to take action and especially start to supply  
**[0:10:03-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:10:03):**  funding?  
**[0:10:04-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:10:04):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:10:05):**  So we were very lucky that our founder, a man called Pert Bernhard, he hailed from Denmark,  
**[0:10:14-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:10:14):**  where this model of cooperative energy ownership is the most common model of mid to large scale  
**[0:10:21-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:10:21):**  renewable energy development.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:10:23):**  So he knew a lot about this model and its success in the European context.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:10:28):**  And in our community, there was a lot of, I guess, unease and unhappiness about what  
**[0:10:35-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:10:35):**  sort of renewables we might be seeing in our local community.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:10:40):**  And so he started socializing the idea of the Danish model and that instead of necessarily  
**[0:10:48-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:10:48):**  having very large projects, we could perhaps have a smaller scale project that was enough  
**[0:10:52-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:10:52):**  for the community and that the community could own it, operate it and benefit from it.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:10:57):**  So he started really socializing that idea back in 2005 and it took up until 2011 for  
**[0:11:07-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:11:07):**  the project to be built.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:11:08):**  So it was really a slow burn.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:11:12):**  You also have to do all the technical studies and try and find a suitable site as well for  
**[0:11:16-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:11:16):**  the wind farm.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:11:17):**  But yeah, he was lucky to work with our landowner Ron, who's now 84 back then.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:11:25):**  And he had a hill just about the right size for two turbines and a grid connection very  
**[0:11:31-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:11:31):**  close.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:11:32):**  So yeah, look, it was early on a lot of just building awareness about the type of model  
**[0:11:39-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:11:39):**  that it could be.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:11:41):**  And then we were lucky to receive a grant from the government to take us through the  
**[0:11:47-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:11:47):**  high risk development phase.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:11:49):**  And once that phase was sort of surpassed and the community was really open and willing  
**[0:11:54-0:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:11:54):**  to invest in the project.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:11:56):**  So we raised just over $10 million to construct the two turbines and took a debt portion from  
**[0:12:06-0:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:12:06):**  our local community bank of $3 million as well.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:12:08):**  So that added that benefit to the community bank.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:12:12):**  Yeah, and the entire way through, we really treated the wind farm as a community asset.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:12:18):**  So we have a lot of like we have little festivals out there and events.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:12:23):**  The turbines have names, the turbines have murals, we do kind of community education  
**[0:12:27-0:12:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:12:27):**  out there.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:12:28):**  So it's yeah, it's very much a community asset.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:12:32):**  And we, you know, we really make sure that we, we kind of protect it as a community asset  
**[0:12:38-0:12:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:12:38):**  as well, which can be, you know, challenging in the times of insurance and, you know, occupational  
**[0:12:43-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:12:43):**  health and safety issues and stuff.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:12:45):**  But we Yeah, we do very well to kind of protect it like that.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:12:49):**  And then I guess, you know, probably one of the projects that I haven't talked about under  
**[0:12:53-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:12:53):**  Hepburn's CEDNET is our growth plans for the energy cooperative.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:12:58):**  And so we actually on Tuesday received our planning permit to add, so we have 4.1 megawatts  
**[0:13:06-0:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:13:06):**  of wind, and we've got our planning permit to add seven megawatts of solar and a 10 megawatt  
**[0:13:11-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:13:11):**  hour battery up at the wind farm site.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:13:14):**  So yeah, that's what we've been working on a couple for a couple of years up on our on  
**[0:13:19-0:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:13:19):**  our hill as well.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:13:21):**  Oh, this is really starting to coalesce, it sounds like into something that not only is  
**[0:13:29-0:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:13:29):**  reducing the metrics that you're trying to improve upon over the long term, but also  
**[0:13:35-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:13:35):**  sounds like it has resilience for having these various aspects that builds in some redundancy  
**[0:13:42-0:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:13:42):**  and probably some protection into the larger system in case something is not working optimally  
**[0:13:47-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:13:47):**  or goes offline.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:13:48):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:13:50):**  It definitely, you know, having a battery of that scale adds a lot of grid resilience  
**[0:13:55-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:13:55):**  improvements, which is fantastic.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:13:58):**  But also, you know, we have a lot of rooftop solar in Australia.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:14:02):**  So during the middle of the day, you know, we're seeing a lot of voltage issues on the  
**[0:14:06-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:14:06):**  grid.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:14:07):**  So having, you know, a battery there, we're also looking at five other sites in the Shire  
**[0:14:11-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:14:11):**  to do community scale batteries, so aggregated batteries as a way to ensure that more people  
**[0:14:17-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:14:17):**  can have solar in their rooftops, because we're definitely having the issue now where  
**[0:14:22-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:14:22):**  we're almost at the threshold of rooftop solar without something like batteries to unlock  
**[0:14:27-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:14:27):**  more of it.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:14:29):**  Yeah, so batteries are really important.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:14:32):**  And then I guess also from a, you know, a climate change adaptation perspective, having  
**[0:14:37-0:14:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:14:37):**  a mixture of technologies is really useful, because, you know, in the years where there's  
**[0:14:43-0:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:14:43):**  like this year, for example, you know, there's been so much rain this year, the wind farms,  
**[0:14:50-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:14:50):**  you know, performing very well, and a solar farm in that context wouldn't perform as well,  
**[0:14:56-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:14:56):**  you know, but then in the years of drought, you would have the reverse situation.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:15:02):**  And then I guess just on a daily level as well, you know, the wind farm generally has  
**[0:15:07-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:15:07):**  much lower generation, or it'll drop out between 11 and three in the middle of the day, and  
**[0:15:13-0:15:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:15:13):**  that's when the sun's up.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:15:14):**  So really pairing those technologies together from a, yeah, from an output perspective,  
**[0:15:21-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:15:21):**  we start to just operate as a 24 hour power plant, even without the battery, and then  
**[0:15:26-0:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:15:26):**  you add the battery, and you certainly achieve that.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:15:28):**  Wow, this is fascinating.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:15:30):**  I've heard some different configurations of amalgamating these power grids and even things  
**[0:15:37-0:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:15:37):**  like microgrids, which we can talk about in a minute, but I'm also interested in kind  
**[0:15:43-0:15:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:15:43):**  of all of the options that are available for energy production at a community scale, as  
**[0:15:48-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:15:48):**  well as some of the services that can be done directly, like cooling or heating, without  
**[0:15:52-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:15:52):**  necessarily having to generate electricity as a medium in between.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:15:57):**  Yeah, like I think, you know, in Australia, we have a very particular thing, particularly  
**[0:16:03-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:16:03):**  in regional Australia, in that we've got so much land space.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:16:07):**  So it's very different to what a village would look like in the European context, for example,  
**[0:16:12-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:16:12):**  where things like district heating make a lot of economic sense.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:16:17):**  We don't have the same, yeah, kind of close locality sort of villages here in that context.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:16:26):**  So heating is a challenge, but what we're starting to see is electrification.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:16:32):**  So a gas to electric transition is happening in a big way in regards to heating and cooling  
**[0:16:38-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:16:38):**  in the Australian context.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:16:40):**  So things like split systems, so reverse heat and air conditioning, and then hot water heat  
**[0:16:48-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:16:48):**  pumps are also becoming a big thing instead of a gas hot water.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:16:52):**  So yeah, I think what we're most likely to see on the Australian grid is really that  
**[0:16:59-0:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:16:59):**  electrification of the grid and for gas to play much less of a role.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:17:06):**  And it makes sense how you've gotten to the conclusion of the pairing of solar and wind  
**[0:17:10-0:17:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:17:10):**  and perhaps using heat pumps for certain applications.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:17:14):**  Did you go through an evaluation process of the needs of the town, as well as the potential  
**[0:17:19-0:17:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:17:19):**  for generation for all of these different options, as well as things like geothermal  
**[0:17:23-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:17:23):**  and perhaps micro hydro?  
**[0:17:25-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:17:25):**  I've seen so many different options out there, and I'm wondering how you got through that  
**[0:17:29-0:17:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:17:29):**  process of evaluating and eventually deciding on the ones that you chose.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:17:33):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:17:34):**  I'll send you our big technology spreadsheet after this.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:17:38):**  You'll probably like it.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:17:39):**  But yeah, look, we definitely looked at every single option technology wise on the table  
**[0:17:45-0:17:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:17:45):**  and included technologies that were affordable now or technologies that would become more  
**[0:17:50-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:17:50):**  affordable over time and then kind of scheduled them into our 10 year plan.  
**[0:17:54-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:17:54):**  So at what time will they become affordable?  
**[0:17:57-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:17:57):**  Okay, probably in 2025.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:17:59):**  That's when we'll start to do programs around that.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:18:02):**  So yeah, it has been very focused on everything.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:18:06):**  But I think what we've seen is that things have been moving far quicker than we have  
**[0:18:14-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:18:14):**  expected.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:18:15):**  So things can be unlocked, like heat pump hot water systems have traditionally been  
**[0:18:19-0:18:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:18:19):**  quite expensive.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:18:20):**  But our state government recently introduced a subsidy, which created a part payment for  
**[0:18:25-0:18:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:18:25):**  them.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:18:26):**  And so all of a sudden, it became very clear that, okay, we weren't planning to do a heat  
**[0:18:29-0:18:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:18:29):**  pump or buy for a few years, but the opportunity is here now.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:18:32):**  And we can really activate our community and show them how to take these opportunities.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:18:38):**  So we'll focus on that.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:18:39):**  And likewise, with electric vehicles, we weren't planning on focusing on electric vehicles  
**[0:18:44-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:18:44):**  till about 2024.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:18:45):**  But then we worked with a partner who was bringing secondhand fleet cars over from Japan.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:18:52):**  So instead of the price point starting at, say, $45,000, the price point started at $17,000.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:18:57):**  Yeah, so everything that we do goes through a full analysis for viability, feasibility,  
**[0:19:05-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:19:05):**  also social desirability.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:19:07):**  And then we add an added characteristic of social justice, meaning that it's got to be  
**[0:19:12-0:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:19:12):**  affordable and accessible for the community.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:19:15):**  So that's the kind of framework that we look to design programs around.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:19:21):**  And what we've been able to show in the past three years in this very small regional shire  
**[0:19:28-0:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:19:28):**  is that if you make these programs accessible and affordable, then people will spend their  
**[0:19:32-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:19:32):**  own money to participate in them.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:19:35):**  So we've seen $5 million of community investment in our programs since we released our community  
**[0:19:42-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:19:42):**  plan in 2019, which is significant for such a small community.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:19:46):**  Yeah, and a huge validation that people really care about what's being developed as well.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:19:52):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:53-0:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:19:53):**  And I think huge trust in the community partners that are making the effort to make sure that  
**[0:20:00-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:20:00):**  the technology options are sound and that there's good warranties and then providing  
**[0:20:05-0:20:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:20:05):**  those solutions to the community.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:20:07):**  Yeah, I'm glad you identified that.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:20:09):**  I mean, trust is just so important when working at a community scale for any type of project.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:20:14):**  And it makes me wonder, in your experience of having done this over planning for the  
**[0:20:19-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:20:19):**  long term, meeting different deadlines and executing when opportunities come up and continuing  
**[0:20:26-0:20:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:20:26):**  along this long term vision, have you seen a big difference in starting with really small  
**[0:20:35-0:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:20:35):**  projects and sort of building them with this larger vision or doing the groundwork and  
**[0:20:40-0:20:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:20:40):**  getting the buy in for something large that gets you momentum that perhaps propels things  
**[0:20:46-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:20:46):**  forward faster?  
**[0:20:47-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:20:47):**  Do you have a preferred approach?  
**[0:20:51-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:20:51):**  It really depends on what the opportunity is in the program and project.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:20:56):**  So for example, our solar and battery storage facility at the wind farm, that's a large  
**[0:21:01-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:21:01):**  project.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:21:02):**  And we're able to do it because we have the existing infrastructure up at the site and  
**[0:21:06-0:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:21:06):**  we've got the internal capability to sort of look at developing a program, a project  
**[0:21:11-0:21:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:21:11):**  like that.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:21:12):**  And that's very, I guess, strategic for us, but it is kind of high risk and it is, you  
**[0:21:17-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:21:17):**  know, but big gains if it works out.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:21:21):**  And there's a range of things that we can do to kind of de-risk it for our cooperative,  
**[0:21:25-0:21:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:21:25):**  like getting a grant to do the development so that, you know, we're not putting our members'  
**[0:21:29-0:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:21:29):**  money at risk and things like that.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:21:31):**  So we certainly kind of where it's, yeah, big risk, we try and make sure that it's not  
**[0:21:36-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:21:36):**  the community's risk per se.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:21:39):**  And then with the smaller programs, like, yeah, we totally have a design and pilot type  
**[0:21:46-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:21:46):**  approach.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:21:47):**  So even with heat pumps, you know, we recently ran our first heat pump by and we ran it as  
**[0:21:54-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:21:54):**  a pilot and we really didn't know what people would think of heat pumps.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:22:00):**  Several years ago, there wasn't, I guess, a good reputation around heat pumps.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:22:04):**  They didn't perform super well in high heat or in really cold temperatures.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:22:09):**  And we can have both here in different seasons.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:22:12):**  So they just didn't have a very good reputation as a robust technology, but now they've improved  
**[0:22:18-0:22:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:22:18):**  greatly and they are very sound and operate well.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:22:22):**  So we were sort of like, oh, what will people think and how would this go?  
**[0:22:25-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:22:25):**  So, you know, we just start small.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:22:28):**  We're like, okay, we want to try and move 30 systems.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:22:31):**  We know that they're a really high quality system.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:22:33):**  We've matched up the subsidies.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:22:35):**  We've arranged, you know, a partner with an installer and, you know, then we run webinars  
**[0:22:40-0:22:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:22:40):**  and education events and get people, they were fully subscribed within several days.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:22:47):**  So, you know, I think we sort of proved, okay, we can do that.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:22:51):**  So next time let's try and get, you know, 60 to 70 systems in a few months later and  
**[0:22:57-0:23:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:22:57):**  just kind of scale it like that and never really go like too big with those pilots,  
**[0:23:03-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:23:03):**  you know, just and, you know, the second and third rounds, but just try and do something  
**[0:23:08-0:23:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:23:08):**  that's really achievable in the community.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:23:12):**  And then I guess in regards to the sort of broader impact, everything that we do, we  
**[0:23:16-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:23:16):**  do under Creative Commons.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:23:18):**  So it's fully available to other communities, you know, when we're not looking to kind of  
**[0:23:23-0:23:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:23:23):**  take over the world, we've got a very like hyper local, let's just make stuff real.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:23:29):**  Let's, you know, give it a go.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:23:32):**  Let's take the risk.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:23:33):**  Yeah, kind of approach.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:23:34):**  I love that.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:23:35):**  That was one of the things I was going to ask about.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:23:38):**  It's how you came to the decision to do that and whether you've coordinated with other  
**[0:23:41-0:23:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:23:41):**  communities since putting out this information on the open source platforms.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:23:45):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:23:46):**  Like this, I mean, there's lots of communities that have used outputs from, you know, Hepburn  
**[0:23:51-0:23:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:23:51):**  Wind as a wind farm model.  
**[0:23:54-0:23:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:23:54):**  Lots of communities have been utilizing the Z-Net kind of methodology and then just like  
**[0:23:59-0:24:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:23:59):**  some of the single programs that we've done, you know, like will often be the first community  
**[0:24:04-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:24:04):**  to kind of trial something and then other communities will sort of take the plunge afterwards  
**[0:24:09-0:24:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:24:09):**  because they can see how we how we kind of worked it out.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:24:12):**  So, yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:24:13):**  I mean, even in the community energy sector, you know, we were the first project way back  
**[0:24:20-0:24:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:24:20):**  when, but now there's over 130 community energy groups across Australia or developing their  
**[0:24:26-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:24:26):**  own kinds of projects.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:24:27):**  And there's a really good culture of sharing in the sector because we are all a little  
**[0:24:33-0:24:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:24:33):**  bit resource-controlled.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:24:34):**  So we, you know, we try and help each other out with sharing our learnings and, you know,  
**[0:24:40-0:24:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:24:40):**  the hard lessons and those sorts of things.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:24:43):**  Well, so this has been quite successful up until this point, but I'm sure we could talk  
**[0:24:49-0:24:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:24:49):**  a lot about things that didn't quite go to plan and some bumps in the road.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:24:53):**  And I think it's important to talk about those to give people a realistic idea of what this  
**[0:24:58-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:24:58):**  process looks like so they don't get derailed by the things that will inevitably come up.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:25:03):**  What have been some of the biggest challenges that have presented themselves since?  
**[0:25:07-0:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:25:07):**  Well, I guess both on the technical side and on the community coordination side.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:25:12):**  Yeah, I mean, if I think back to the wind farm development, you know, trying to build  
**[0:25:22-0:25:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:25:22):**  a large construction project, you know, just off the end of the global economic crisis  
**[0:25:27-0:25:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:25:27):**  and trying to raise capital around that, the exchange rates were all over the place.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:25:33):**  You know, the project was more expensive than it was ever intended to be.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:25:38):**  And, you know, there was moments where we went to the community and said, should we  
**[0:25:43-0:25:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:25:43):**  just do one?  
**[0:25:46-0:25:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:25:46):**  And the community sort of voted for two.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:25:50):**  And likewise, once we were up and operating, it was there was a lot of opposition to renewables  
**[0:25:58-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:25:58):**  from the federal and state political arena.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:26:01):**  And so the market price for renewables wasn't great.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:26:03):**  And, you know, we didn't have a very strong income for a few years there.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:26:08):**  And so we would have to go to our members and say, you know, what would you like us  
**[0:26:11-0:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:26:11):**  to do with the income?  
**[0:26:12-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:26:12):**  Would you like returns?  
**[0:26:13-0:26:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:26:13):**  Or would you like us to prioritize debt?  
**[0:26:16-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:26:16):**  And so we pay down our finance faster.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:26:19):**  And you know, in that context, for example, our members decided to accelerate our debt  
**[0:26:24-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:26:24):**  repayments.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:26:25):**  So instead of taking 15 years for us to pay our loan, we paid it down in six years.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:26:30):**  So I think that dynamic of just making sure that the community is part of the decision  
**[0:26:34-0:26:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:26:34):**  making process where they can be has always been really important to us.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:26:38):**  And likewise, when we're, you know, kind of suffering from political issues, we really  
**[0:26:43-0:26:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:26:43):**  advocate, you know, we don't have vested interests, we can say what we want in that space.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:26:48):**  So we generally kind of punch a little bit above our weight, and we really bring our  
**[0:26:52-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:26:52):**  members with us.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:26:54):**  So we want to run a political campaign, you know, calling out what's happening, we we  
**[0:26:59-0:27:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:26:59):**  certainly do it and our members expect us to do that too.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:27:04):**  And then I guess on more of a technical perspective, you know, there's just the things that happen  
**[0:27:11-0:27:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:27:11):**  out at site.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:27:13):**  And so, you know, making sure that you've got really good relationships with your different  
**[0:27:20-0:27:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:27:20):**  service providers and making sure you've got enough spare parts and you know, the contracts  
**[0:27:26-0:27:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:27:26):**  are robust, it's definitely been an iterative process over the years, you know, we've kind  
**[0:27:31-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:27:31):**  of moved shape quite a few times about how we do the technical asset management out on  
**[0:27:38-0:27:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:27:38):**  site.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:27:40):**  And really, I think the conclusion for us where we're at now is just really investing  
**[0:27:45-0:27:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:27:45):**  in our long term relationships with our local providers so that we get, you know, fast service  
**[0:27:51-0:27:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:27:51):**  and people care, you know, like, like, we're a two turbine.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:27:56):**  We found if there's a wind farm down the road, that's got 100 turbines, and they, you know,  
**[0:28:01-0:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:28:01):**  they got so much more clout than us.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:28:04):**  And we don't have permanent staff out at the wind farm site to operate it.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:28:09):**  Technically, it's a remote site.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:28:11):**  So we really need, yeah, those relationships for it to work, which is where we're at now.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:28:19):**  And that also brings me to one of the more controversial aspects, especially of sustainable  
**[0:28:23-0:28:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:28:23):**  energy, in that there are a lot of critiques at where materials are sourced.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:28:29):**  And just because the energy is not being generated from fossil fuels or other non renewable sources,  
**[0:28:36-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:28:36):**  that doesn't necessarily make it sustainable.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:28:39):**  What is your thought on this?  
**[0:28:40-0:28:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:28:40):**  And how does it fit into the goal towards net zero when sourcing materials as well?  
**[0:28:46-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:28:46):**  Yeah, yeah, I mean, it's a really tricky space.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:28:50):**  I think there's a few intersections there that are really important.  
**[0:28:55-0:29:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:28:55):**  I think, firstly, knowing what the carbon footprint is of the technology you're deploying.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:29:01):**  So let's say for wind farms, or at least wind farms of our turbine vintage, I know now it's  
**[0:29:08-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:29:08):**  a lot quicker because the turbines are a lot larger.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:29:10):**  But, you know, it was, I think we calculated it was a seven month carbon footprint payback  
**[0:29:17-0:29:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:29:17):**  period from when we were first generating.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:29:19):**  So, you know, understanding what the payback period is, understanding, you know, when you're  
**[0:29:25-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:29:25):**  doing tenders, or procurement, how to factor in ethical factors, you know, if you if you  
**[0:29:33-0:29:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:29:33):**  have the opportunity to so that you start socialising these ideas down the procurement  
**[0:29:37-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:29:37):**  line that, you know, people want high quality projects.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:29:43):**  And then I think there's, you know, the bigger discussion and, you know, I think we're starting  
**[0:29:46-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:29:46):**  to have that discussion now in Australia more broadly about, you know, where are these,  
**[0:29:52-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:29:52):**  you know, minerals and other inputs actually coming from?  
**[0:29:55-0:29:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:29:55):**  And what are the conditions of those mines like?  
**[0:29:59-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:29:59):**  Because, you know, a regulation within Australia is not the same regulation for a mine over  
**[0:30:04-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:30:04):**  in Africa.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:30:06):**  And so, you know, what are we actually doing about that and the companies, which, you know,  
**[0:30:11-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:30:11):**  often those companies are trading in Australia and trading over there, but they often won't  
**[0:30:15-0:30:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:30:15):**  be following the same, you know, a strong international rule across all those sites.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:30:21):**  So, you know, I think there's that kind of ethical mining conversation is really important.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:30:30):**  And then, you know, what happens at the end of life cycle is the other really big thing  
**[0:30:36-0:30:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:30:36):**  that we all need to talk about.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:30:38):**  You know, I think from a wind turbine perspective, the exciting thing that's happened over the  
**[0:30:43-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:30:43):**  past few years, which certainly wasn't a reality 10 years ago, is the repowering space.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:30:48):**  So essentially leaving the towers on and the foundations for putting a new hub, nacelle  
**[0:30:55-0:31:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:30:55):**  and blades on and, you know, giving the turbines at the end of bed kind of 25, 30 years, another  
**[0:31:02-0:31:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:31:02):**  10 to 15 years.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:31:04):**  So certainly for us, we have asked our operation and maintenance provider in the next six years  
**[0:31:11-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:31:11):**  to provide us with a plan for repowering and what the costs and benefits of that will be.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:31:17):**  So I think, you know, planning appropriately for things like that.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:31:20):**  So we're not just looking to kind of pull down projects completely.  
**[0:31:24-0:31:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:31:24):**  What can we actually use and retrofit and go again with, I think is a really important  
**[0:31:29-0:31:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:31:29):**  discussion.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:31:30):**  And then for the bits that we can't use, what's the recyclability or the reuse factor that's  
**[0:31:35-0:31:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:31:35):**  happening?  
**[0:31:36-0:31:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:31:36):**  There's so many conversations in Australia at the moment about the stewardship of solar  
**[0:31:41-0:31:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:31:41):**  panels, for example, and lots of new companies starting up that can do like, you know, 99.9%  
**[0:31:49-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:31:49):**  recycling of solar panels and also a battery, you know, technologies.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:31:54):**  But there's also, you know, could these solar panels have another life?  
**[0:31:59-0:32:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:31:59):**  Sure, they might not have, you know, a high capacity factor, their use and quality, you  
**[0:32:06-0:32:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:32:06):**  know, might have reduced a little bit, but could they possibly have another life, either  
**[0:32:11-0:32:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:32:11):**  internationally, you know, in developing countries or, you know, in social housing or vulnerable  
**[0:32:18-0:32:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:32:18):**  households so that they, if they are able to be reused and certified and given a warranty  
**[0:32:23-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:32:23):**  and not sort of be an orphaned solar panel, well, could they have another life before  
**[0:32:27-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:32:27):**  they're actually pulled apart?  
**[0:32:30-0:32:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:32:30):**  You know, we're starting to see in Australia, there's one brand that's taking old Nissan  
**[0:32:37-0:32:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:32:37):**  Leaf batteries from inside the electric cars and aggregating them for community batteries.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:32:45):**  So giving them another life, they've got enough of a, you know, life cycle left in them to  
**[0:32:51-0:32:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:32:51):**  be useful on masks, and they're not so large that it's, you know, a big impost.  
**[0:32:56-0:33:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:32:56):**  So you know, I think creative solutions like that, where we're looking at reuse as well  
**[0:33:01-0:33:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:33:01):**  as recycling and things like that is, it's happening, you know, there's so much discussion  
**[0:33:07-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:33:07):**  about the circular economy.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:33:10):**  And this sort of, I think, draws a lot of those characteristics together.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:33:14):**  Well, let's bring that back into this larger scope of this net zero ambition for the community.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:33:22):**  And some of the things that you have learned since starting it, and included in the conversation  
**[0:33:28-0:33:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:33:28):**  that perhaps weren't part of the initial proposal, like you mentioned transportation, waste reduction,  
**[0:33:34-0:33:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:33:34):**  like you were talking about from the systems that have already been installed.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:33:38):**  Where is the conversation in your community on that front?  
**[0:33:41-0:33:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:33:41):**  And what are some of the initiatives that you're considering are already moving forward  
**[0:33:44-0:33:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:33:44):**  with?  
**[0:33:45-0:33:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:33:45):**  Yeah, I think the really big one in our community is agriculture.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:33:51):**  So being a regional shire, the agriculture emissions are the largest, followed by stationary  
**[0:33:56-0:33:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:33:56):**  energy and then transport.  
**[0:33:57-0:34:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:33:57):**  So there, obviously, there's a lot happening in the stationary energy area already.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:34:04):**  And I think we're sort of kind of all systems attack on that one.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:34:08):**  But agriculture and transport are the big tricky ones.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:34:14):**  And so really trying to do things on a grassroots level, like develop education materials and  
**[0:34:22-0:34:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:34:22):**  start the conversations on a farmer to farmer level about how are we going to get there  
**[0:34:28-0:34:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:34:28):**  with agriculture footprint and what sort of projects and pilot programs could be useful.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:34:37):**  So yeah, that's very much a kind of emergent piece.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:34:41):**  And then the transport one, we're sort of definitely attacking it on the electric vehicle  
**[0:34:46-0:34:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:34:46):**  and the electric charging station level.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:34:48):**  But there's also so much emergence with hydrogen and I guess fuel switching more broadly that  
**[0:34:55-0:35:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:34:55):**  could be bigger than that and community transport and safer bike lanes and e-bikes and that  
**[0:35:02-0:35:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:35:02):**  whole gamut.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:35:03):**  And I think that's sort of the next conversations that we want to have in the community is how  
**[0:35:08-0:35:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:35:08):**  do we tie, you know, in regional Australia, the roads are very unsafe.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:35:13):**  So the idea that you're sort of encouraging people to ride more bikes and to have e-bikes,  
**[0:35:20-0:35:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:35:20):**  the roads can be very unsafe for that kind of behaviour.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:35:23):**  So how do we create more bike lanes and make them fit for use is a big topic locally.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:35:32):**  And then I think, you know, more broadly, we've seen the need to, so Z-Net currently  
**[0:35:40-0:35:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:35:40):**  is very much a mitigation model.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:35:42):**  It's all about producing emissions.  
**[0:35:44-0:35:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:35:44):**  But there's the overlap of climate change adaptation.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:35:49):**  So how we deal with, you know, emergency disaster events and what are our climate vulnerabilities.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:35:58):**  So we've had a lot of bushfires in the area and also a lot of storms as well, particularly  
**[0:36:05-0:36:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:36:05):**  the past 12 months, really big storms that have taken out, you know, border and power  
**[0:36:10-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:36:10):**  to communities for days locally and have flattened big areas of the forest.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:36:16):**  So, you know, that real overlap with biodiversity loss.  
**[0:36:20-0:36:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:36:20):**  And so what we're focused on this year is expanding our Z-Net model to include climate  
**[0:36:27-0:36:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:36:27):**  change adaptation as well as the circular economy.  
**[0:36:31-0:36:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:36:31):**  So we can start to bring some of that thriving local economy piece back through.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:36:37):**  And, you know, I guess more sophistication about waste streams and the things that you  
**[0:36:42-0:36:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:36:42):**  were mentioning about life cycle impacts of different technologies as well.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:36:46):**  So we're sort of working out how to build that picture in a way that's very place-based  
**[0:36:52-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:36:52):**  with those elements as well.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:36:54):**  That's really impressive.  
**[0:36:56-0:37:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:36:56):**  I haven't heard of any other projects like this that have taken on the scope of considerations  
**[0:37:01-0:37:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:37:01):**  that you've been doing.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:37:03):**  And with your coordination and communication with other communities that are trying to  
**[0:37:07-0:37:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:37:07):**  do the same thing, where have been some of the sticking points or the difficulties or  
**[0:37:13-0:37:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:37:13):**  perhaps hurdles to get over when it comes to just such a broad consideration of all  
**[0:37:17-0:37:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:37:17):**  of these things and inevitably the stakeholders that are involved with making progress in  
**[0:37:23-0:37:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:37:23):**  these metrics?  
**[0:37:24-0:37:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:37:24):**  Yeah, I think there's so many different ways to approach it, depending on what the needs  
**[0:37:30-0:37:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:37:30):**  are of a local community.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:37:32):**  I think, you know, for a community like ours, we really want the data.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:37:36):**  We want the rigorous modeling.  
**[0:37:38-0:37:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:37:38):**  We want to see the trajectory.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:37:40):**  We want to be able to track our progress against that trajectory and, you know, be kind of  
**[0:37:46-0:37:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:37:46):**  very active in that process.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:37:50):**  And I think that's possible because, you know, there is sort of like a community sector plus  
**[0:37:56-0:38:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:37:56):**  the business sector plus our council and municipality all kind of coming together and really trying  
**[0:38:01-0:38:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:38:01):**  to work on these projects.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:38:03):**  But for many other communities, it can be enough to sort of focus on a couple of either  
**[0:38:10-0:38:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:38:10):**  low-hanging fruit kind of projects where it's like, okay, running a solar and battery bog  
**[0:38:14-0:38:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:38:14):**  buy is going to get us a big win here or doing engagement with our local Indigenous traditional  
**[0:38:21-0:38:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:38:21):**  owner group so that we encourage more care for the country is going to be a big win in  
**[0:38:25-0:38:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:38:25):**  our community.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:38:26):**  And sort of targeting these meaningful one by one projects, I think, is a really great  
**[0:38:33-0:38:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:38:33):**  approach and there's been quite a few community groups that might take some of the information  
**[0:38:40-0:38:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:38:40):**  that we're doing, but instead of wanting the whole thing and the rigorous modeling and  
**[0:38:46-0:38:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:38:46):**  the different kind of outputs, they're more sort of just grabbing a project and going,  
**[0:38:49-0:38:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:38:49):**  oh, yeah, we could do something like that, but maybe, you know, change it up a little  
**[0:38:53-0:38:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:38:53):**  bit.  
**[0:38:54-0:38:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:38:54):**  Yeah.  
**[0:38:55-0:39:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:38:55):**  Or, you know, other communities have just focused on distinct things like 100% renewables  
**[0:39:02-0:39:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:39:02):**  or 100% fossil free.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:39:04):**  So they're looking at, you know, energy plus transport.  
**[0:39:07-0:39:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:39:07):**  Yeah.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:39:08):**  So I think that there's just so many different ways to carve it up.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:39:12):**  And what you want is something that isn't too kind of, you know, perfect or utopian  
**[0:39:21-0:39:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:39:21):**  or, you know, you don't want to wait until you've got enough money so that you can do  
**[0:39:25-0:39:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:39:25):**  this perfect thing.  
**[0:39:27-0:39:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:39:27):**  I think it's good to just sort of start with what you can and go from there.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:39:33):**  And it seems like there's amazing potential in posing these challenges to the community  
**[0:39:38-0:39:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:39:38):**  and see who has ideas or who steps forward to say, hey, like maybe this is one thing  
**[0:39:43-0:39:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:39:43):**  that I can help to affect or some industry members that have responsibility over an aspect  
**[0:39:49-0:39:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:39:49):**  of what you're trying to improve and divide the ownership while still including it as  
**[0:39:55-0:39:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:39:55):**  part of this community identity and an everybody wins kind of outcome.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:39:59):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:40:01):**  Yeah.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:40:02):**  I mean, you know, we've sort of been heads down a little bit and just trying to get projects  
**[0:40:07-0:40:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:40:07):**  and programs up.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:40:09):**  But really, we're only able to have a big impact through the range of partners that  
**[0:40:14-0:40:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:40:14):**  are willing to work with us and who are willing to kind of do their bit.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:40:18):**  And it's just been fantastic to see, like we have our regional water authority who is  
**[0:40:24-0:40:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:40:24):**  really active and we have our regional greenhouse alliance that is, you know, being leading  
**[0:40:29-0:40:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:40:29):**  on a bunch of projects.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:40:31):**  And then, yeah, you know, suppliers like the network that supports the electric vehicle  
**[0:40:37-0:40:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:40:37):**  charging stations, they've come on board as a partner.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:40:39):**  And yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:40:41-0:40:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:40:41):**  It's yeah, I think it's very having a shared vision and then just kind of step by step  
**[0:40:47-0:40:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:40:47):**  bringing more partners on board so that, yeah, you're not you're not trying to do everything  
**[0:40:52-0:40:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:40:52):**  yourself is with limited resources is definitely the way to go.  
**[0:40:57-0:41:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:40:57):**  Now, so you work to help to develop this best practice of community engagement guides.  
**[0:41:04-0:41:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:41:04):**  Let's go to this document here.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:41:05):**  And could you give me a bit of an overview of some of these best practices, the ones  
**[0:41:10-0:41:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:41:10):**  that have been most useful in your aspect of the work?  
**[0:41:14-0:41:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:41:14):**  Great.  
**[0:41:15-0:41:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:41:15):**  So in regards to the community transition plan, I think picking up on what you were  
**[0:41:20-0:41:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:41:20):**  saying before about that the community can often have such a breadth of ideas.  
**[0:41:28-0:41:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:41:28):**  We've really found that over the years.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:41:30):**  And one of the key components to doing any project like this is really doing a review  
**[0:41:37-0:41:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:41:37):**  of historical actions.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:41:39):**  So I call that a context narrative where you kind of go back in time and you go, you know,  
**[0:41:44-0:41:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:41:44):**  so many different groups or the council or different stakeholders have had these ideas  
**[0:41:48-0:41:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:41:48):**  over time and they may not have been technology technologically possible or feasible at that  
**[0:41:55-0:41:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:41:55):**  time, but maybe their time is now.  
**[0:41:58-0:42:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:41:58):**  So we did a big historical sweep of ideas from different reports so that also so that  
**[0:42:03-0:42:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:42:03):**  locally the community wouldn't think that we were sort of reinventing the wheel or,  
**[0:42:09-0:42:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:42:09):**  you know, not remembering what what kind of came before.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:42:12):**  So doing that historical sweep is always really useful.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:42:15):**  And then also doing like a project harvesting idea, a project harvesting activity for new  
**[0:42:22-0:42:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:42:22):**  ideas is also a really useful thing to do so that then you can capture all the ideas  
**[0:42:27-0:42:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:42:27):**  out in the community.  
**[0:42:28-0:42:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:42:28):**  So they're two kind of key components to developing a community plan.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:42:34):**  In doing this carbon or this place based carbon emissions inventory, are you really like,  
**[0:42:42-0:42:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:42:42):**  I see things like going ward by ward and including things like tourism as well.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:42:49):**  This is, again, really broad.  
**[0:42:52-0:42:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:42:52):**  How do you how do you put parameters on this?  
**[0:42:55-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:42:55):**  Because they're like, the level of detail that you can go into is almost infinite here.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:43:01):**  Do you decide that upfront where you're going to put the limits on or is there inevitably  
**[0:43:07-0:43:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:43:07):**  all of these factors even from outside going to have to play a role in putting out a feasible  
**[0:43:13-0:43:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:43:13):**  plan in the long term?  
**[0:43:15-0:43:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:43:15):**  Yeah, look, in the Australian context, we have in regards to carbon emissions in countries,  
**[0:43:22-0:43:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:43:22):**  there is a platform that offers a very top down approximation of what your carbon footprint  
**[0:43:30-0:43:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:43:30):**  per postcode or per kind of municipality looks like.  
**[0:43:34-0:43:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:43:34):**  So that in itself is often enough for most communities, but it's generally has a lot  
**[0:43:42-0:43:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:43:42):**  of errors in it.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:43:44):**  And it's not sort of locally correct enough to track progress on because it very much  
**[0:43:51-0:43:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:43:51):**  is from that federal government to state government level aggregated data.  
**[0:43:55-0:44:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:43:55):**  So for us, and this is not universal, this is not what every community would want, but  
**[0:44:01-0:44:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:44:01):**  for us, it was really important to be able to track progress.  
**[0:44:04-0:44:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:44:04):**  And so as much as we could harvest real data from the ground that was as correct as it  
**[0:44:13-0:44:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:44:13):**  could possibly be, then that's what we were seeking to do.  
**[0:44:16-0:44:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:44:16):**  So for example, for the electricity data, so this is very exact.  
**[0:44:26-0:44:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:44:26):**  We get in Australia, we have smart meters on every house.  
**[0:44:31-0:44:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:44:31):**  So we get an extract literally of the smart meter data per house for our shile.  
**[0:44:37-0:44:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:44:37):**  And then we use another platform to import the solar generation and consumption for each  
**[0:44:44-0:44:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:44:44):**  household as well.  
**[0:44:48-0:44:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:44:48):**  And yeah, and so we sort of map that on a year by year basis.  
**[0:44:52-0:44:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:44:52):**  So it's very much down to that household granular level.  
**[0:44:55-0:45:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:44:55):**  So that's how we can represent different wards, which are the different towns in our shile.  
**[0:45:01-0:45:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:45:01):**  Other areas like transport is very hard to get ground up data.  
**[0:45:06-0:45:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:45:06):**  So it's more of an aggregated top-down approach with a community survey that we use to give  
**[0:45:12-0:45:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:45:12):**  a bit more granularity.  
**[0:45:15-0:45:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:45:15):**  And then with things like agriculture, we were very lucky that several years ago, our  
**[0:45:22-0:45:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:45:22):**  municipality had done a data collection project to really look at all the different, what  
**[0:45:29-0:45:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:45:29):**  all the different farms were growing, how many apple trees and pear trees and the orchards  
**[0:45:35-0:45:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:45:35):**  and like really got very granular.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:45:38):**  And so we used that in combination with the livestock registry data.  
**[0:45:43-0:45:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:45:43):**  So every sheep and cow has to be registered, chicken has to be registered locally.  
**[0:45:48-0:45:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:45:48):**  So we're able to get very, very granular data on those levels.  
**[0:45:52-0:45:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:45:52):**  But yeah, as I said, it's not necessary for every community, but for us, particularly  
**[0:45:58-0:46:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:45:58):**  the electricity component, we really want to be able to track it year on year.  
**[0:46:04-0:46:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:46:04):**  And part of this conversation, aside from just how much can be reduced as far as consumption  
**[0:46:09-0:46:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:46:09):**  and waste, what are some of the key interventions that you've identified that can actually add  
**[0:46:15-0:46:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:46:15):**  a positive impact and offset some of the things that cannot be reduced down to zero?  
**[0:46:20-0:46:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:46:20):**  Yeah, so already, you know, where we are, we have a large and very beautiful forest  
**[0:46:27-0:46:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:46:27):**  called the Wombat Forest, and it is already acting as a really significant carbon sink  
**[0:46:32-0:46:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:46:32):**  for the local area.  
**[0:46:33-0:46:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:46:33):**  So it's around 13 percent that it's offsetting already.  
**[0:46:38-0:46:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:46:38):**  So it's about to be turned into a national park as well, which means that it can't be  
**[0:46:44-0:46:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:46:44):**  logged.  
**[0:46:45-0:46:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:46:45):**  So it's land use won't change over time.  
**[0:46:47-0:46:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:46:47):**  So, you know, expanding on, you know, what what our footprint is locally in regards to,  
**[0:46:55-0:47:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:46:55):**  you know, tree planting and carbon sequestration through offsetting means, you know, is sort  
**[0:47:01-0:47:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:47:01):**  of one pathway.  
**[0:47:02-0:47:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:47:02):**  You know, soil carbon is another thing that's got a lot of traction here as well.  
**[0:47:09-0:47:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:47:09):**  So yeah, I guess we call local offsetting insetting because you're doing it locally.  
**[0:47:17-0:47:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:47:17):**  So we're really trying to activate a bunch of projects that are looking at insetting  
**[0:47:21-0:47:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:47:21):**  in more detail and particularly really trying to support farmers to have more biodiversity  
**[0:47:28-0:47:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:47:28):**  on their farm, which serves that carbon sequestration area, but also enhances what's going on locally  
**[0:47:37-0:47:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:47:37):**  in regards to green corridors for different wildlife and things like that.  
**[0:47:42-0:47:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:47:42):**  And this has been really eye opening.  
**[0:47:44-0:47:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:47:44):**  I hadn't realized just how thorough this project was, was taking so many considerations into  
**[0:47:51-0:47:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:47:51):**  the calculations and the projections out in the future.  
**[0:47:54-0:47:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:47:54):**  I'm wondering if you have advice for someone perhaps even like me who is hoping to start  
**[0:47:59-0:48:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:47:59):**  similar initiatives in their community.  
**[0:48:02-0:48:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:48:02):**  What are some first steps and where can they go to get more information that can guide  
**[0:48:07-0:48:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:48:07):**  them through this very complex process?  
**[0:48:11-0:48:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:48:11):**  I mean, I think one of the earliest steps is sort of just, you know, there's what can  
**[0:48:15-0:48:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:48:15):**  you do at home?  
**[0:48:16-0:48:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:48:16):**  What can you just do with your own lifestyle and home?  
**[0:48:19-0:48:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:48:19):**  And then what are some conversations you could have locally about what a shared ambition  
**[0:48:24-0:48:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:48:24):**  might look like?  
**[0:48:26-0:48:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:48:26):**  And that really depends on where you are and what that context is.  
**[0:48:30-0:48:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:48:30):**  You know, I know that there is a lot of free resources out there through different websites.  
**[0:48:36-0:48:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:48:36):**  Obviously, we make everything for us really available on the Hepburnsednet.org.au site.  
**[0:48:44-0:48:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:48:44):**  But there's a bunch of different sites that are global, such as 100 percent RE.  
**[0:48:50-0:48:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:48:50):**  They have a lot of renewable energy transition information.  
**[0:48:54-0:49:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:48:54):**  Then there's some great communities like SAMHSA over in Denmark who are doing really fantastic  
**[0:49:00-0:49:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:49:00):**  work and also have a bunch of material available.  
**[0:49:04-0:49:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:49:04):**  So yeah, really seeking out who's doing interesting work, looking at their websites.  
**[0:49:08-0:49:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:49:08):**  Yeah, I think broadly speaking from the community led climate transition piece, there's so much  
**[0:49:14-0:49:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:49:14):**  sharing happening.  
**[0:49:16-0:49:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:49:16):**  So yeah, there's a lot out there.  
**[0:49:19-0:49:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:49:19):**  And that is really inspiring.  
**[0:49:21-0:49:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:49:21):**  Taryn, where can our listeners find out more about your work, the ZNet program and the  
**[0:49:26-0:49:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:49:26):**  resources that are being shared on the open source platforms?  
**[0:49:30-0:49:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:49:30):**  Yeah, so we also have our peak body in Australia, which is called the Coalition for Community  
**[0:49:36-0:49:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:49:36):**  Energy.  
**[0:49:37-0:49:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:49:37):**  So I'm one of the founders of that.  
**[0:49:39-0:49:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:49:39):**  And we have an educational wiki where we put all of our, you know, all of the resources  
**[0:49:46-0:49:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:49:46):**  we can gather from around the space, including, you know, ones that we've produced.  
**[0:49:51-0:49:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:49:51):**  So that's on C4CE.net.au.  
**[0:49:57-0:49:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:49:57):**  So that's one site.  
**[0:49:58-0:50:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:49:58):**  And otherwise, yeah, on either our hip and wind or hip and ZNet websites.  
**[0:50:03-0:50:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:50:03):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:50:04-0:50:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:50:04):**  Well, Taryn, this has been quite a deep dive.  
**[0:50:07-0:50:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:50:07):**  You responded really well to those questions.  
**[0:50:10-0:50:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:50:10):**  And sorry for grilling you so much, but that's okay.  
**[0:50:15-0:50:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:50:15):**  I learned a lot.  
**[0:50:16-0:50:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:50:16):**  Thank you so much for taking the time here.  
**[0:50:18-0:50:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:50:18):**  It was wonderful to chat with you.  
**[0:50:21-0:50:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/taryn-lane-on-how-to-mobilize-a-community-to-reach-net-zero/#t=0:50:21):**  Let's stay up to date.

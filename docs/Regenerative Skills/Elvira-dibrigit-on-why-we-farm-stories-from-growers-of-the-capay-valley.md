**[0:16:02-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:16:02):**  So for instance, like the farmer veggie boxes that I used to see when I first moved here  
**[0:16:07-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:16:07):**  just had the farm name on it maybe, you know, if it wasn't some generic box.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:16:13):**  And now there are boxes that the farmers can buy together as a community that have the

**[0:17:15-0:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:17:15):**  that you profiled for land stewardship, I know they also have a major concern from those

**[0:17:49-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:17:49):**  because I was definitely interviewing during the drought and people were really concerned  
**[0:17:54-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:17:54):**  about that.  
**[0:17:55-0:18:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:17:55):**  And that, you know, the drought seems to be something in California that comes around  
**[0:18:00-0:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:18:00):**  every, I don't know, every 10 years or so.

**[0:20:11-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:20:11):**  as a community and this big influence coming in with all more traffic?

**[0:25:41-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:25:41):**  and their own learning experiences.

**[0:25:52-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:25:52):**  Yeah, some of the big pieces of advice was to do internships and do as many as you can  
**[0:26:02-0:26:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:26:02):**  and take your time with that.

**[0:26:10-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:26:10):**  been able to do in other areas of the world.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:26:13):**  We have some people who've gone back to Ohio and Minnesota where it's mostly corn and soy

**[0:26:25-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:26:25):**  Yeah, that's amazing.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:26:28):**  But getting back to your question, another thing that really surprised me was that farmers  
**[0:26:36-0:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:26:36):**  saying you don't have to start by buying the land.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:26:39):**  You can lease the land and then grow your business and then buy land.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:26:47):**  Once you've got capital going and got your markets and you feel secure.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:26:54):**  And there's also, yeah, I learned that there are a lot of organizations that can really  
**[0:26:59-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:26:59):**  help farmers.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:27:01):**  From Pastor 42, once they learned about the Farm to Consumer Legal Defense Fund, they

**[0:27:18-0:27:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:27:18):**  out of business but they're starting one from their own creativity but feeling like they  
**[0:27:25-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:27:25):**  have the security of a group and organization behind them.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:27:32):**  And also with interns too, there are groups like Mesa where they can help educate interns  
**[0:27:43-0:27:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:27:43):**  as a group and help farmers to make sure that they're doing everything legal in terms of  
**[0:27:49-0:27:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:27:49):**  taking on interns.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:27:51):**  Yeah, and so there's definitely a lot of help out there and that was something that the  
**[0:27:59-0:28:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:27:59):**  farmers here really shared with me.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:28:03):**  And yeah, Annie Henner at LeapFrog Farm was so great how she was saying that she never  
**[0:28:09-0:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:28:09):**  thought that she would want to go into farming even though she saw it around her as she was  
**[0:28:14-0:28:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:28:14):**  growing up.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:28:15):**  She was spending time on farms as a child but wasn't interested in what was really going  
**[0:28:21-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:28:21):**  on there.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:28:22):**  And how that changed as, like you said, she took these little gardening jobs in college  
**[0:28:29-0:28:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:28:29):**  and then one thing led to another.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:28:33):**  And she really talks about how the community here is really important to her from starting  
**[0:28:40-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:28:40):**  out from scratch, just realizing that she could ask another farmer for help with fixing  
**[0:28:48-0:28:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:28:48):**  her tractor or just all kinds of advice.  
**[0:28:53-0:29:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:28:53):**  And she has been really active with the Young Farmers Guild, I forget the name of it exactly,  
**[0:29:01-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:29:01):**  but that's another organization that she has found helpful.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:29:06):**  Yeah, I'm really glad you mentioned these organizations.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:29:09):**  Like you said, the Young Farmers Guild and the Legal Action Fund that you spoke about  
**[0:29:14-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:29:14):**  that helped the owners of Pastor 42.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:29:16):**  I mean, if I remember specifically, they had to find a creative way to allow unpasteurized  
**[0:29:23-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:29:23):**  milk products into market because as it currently stands under FDA regulations in the United  
**[0:29:28-0:29:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:29:28):**  States, you can't sell unpasteurized dairy products to consumers directly.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:29:35):**  And basically, they found a way around it by having basically a membership of consumers  
**[0:29:42-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:29:42):**  that directly bought shares of the cattle that they have on their ranch and in that  
**[0:29:48-0:29:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:29:48):**  way they can get the dairy products directly without it having to go to market.  
**[0:29:54-0:30:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:29:54):**  I love loopholes like that, but it definitely exposes some of the idiosyncrasies and maybe  
**[0:30:01-0:30:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:30:01):**  even call them corrupt aspects of our agricultural regulations.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:30:07):**  So for anybody who's got dairy funds, that may be a creative or a viable way to stick  
**[0:30:14-0:30:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:30:14):**  to your ethics or offer higher quality products when it's seemingly impossible otherwise.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:30:20):**  Yeah, they were just really lucky to have met some other people who were exploring this  
**[0:30:27-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:30:27):**  option and they were ready to jump in.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:30:29):**  But yeah, overregulation is – well, I don't know if it's overregulation, but just the  
**[0:30:36-0:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:30:36):**  differences in regulation for big agribusiness compared to small farms, that's one thing  
**[0:30:44-0:30:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:30:44):**  that I love about this project is that we really need to be able to differentiate and  
**[0:30:50-0:30:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:30:50):**  have different regulations for different types of farms because it's really a burden on  
**[0:30:57-0:31:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:30:57):**  the small farms to have – well, some of the extra costs of some of the regulations  
**[0:31:04-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:31:04):**  like the Clean Water Act was one thing that farmers mentioned and the minimum wage doesn't  
**[0:31:11-0:31:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:31:11):**  really work with how seasonal labor is – they can't pay overtime to people during this  
**[0:31:18-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:31:18):**  time of high harvest.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:31:20):**  So yeah, it's tricky, but people are being creative about things like that also in terms  
**[0:31:28-0:31:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:31:28):**  of well, having maybe a collective workforce that can go different farms through the summer  
**[0:31:37-0:31:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:31:37):**  or spread it out so that they're working the same amount of hours but not on one farm  
**[0:31:42-0:31:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/elvira-dibrigit-on-why-we-farm-stories-from-growers-of-the-capay-valley/#t=0:31:42):**  so that way it doesn't get into the high cost of having overtime.

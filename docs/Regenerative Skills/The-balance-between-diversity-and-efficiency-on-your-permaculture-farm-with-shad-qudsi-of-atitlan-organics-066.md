**[0:01:57-0:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:01:57):**  We also go in depth on the often neglected subject on lifestyle design around your farm  
**[0:02:03-0:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:02:03):**  and how to prevent your plant and animal-based enterprises from trapping you in a cycle of  
**[0:02:07-0:02:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:02:07):**  constant maintenance and preventing you from living the life you want.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:02:11):**  It seems the modern context of regenerative farming comes with a lot of advantages but  
**[0:02:15-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:02:15):**  also limitations if you're not clear about the life you want to live around farming.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:02:19):**  So I hope that this is a discussion that many of you listeners will feel compelled to jump  
**[0:02:23-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:02:23):**  in on.

**[0:02:28-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:02:28):**  You can always write to us on Abundant Edge Facebook page or email us directly at info

**[0:03:04-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:03:04):**  With one of the topics that everybody is interested in when it comes to farm design and making  
**[0:03:10-0:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:03:10):**  sure that profitability is worked into the plan.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:03:14):**  And that is kind of the paradox of efficiency and diversity.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:03:18):**  Now I know that especially for ecological health, diversity is really essential.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:03:24):**  If you have monoculture plantings or you know just one type of animal, it's very very hard  
**[0:03:30-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:03:30):**  for a healthy ecosystem to sustain something like that.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:03:33):**  While at the same time you have to work with the efficiencies of turning out products from  
**[0:03:39-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:03:39):**  either your plants or your animal systems.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:03:41):**  And it's really hard to do if there's a lot of really small ones.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:03:46):**  Give me some examples from your eight years of permaculture farming on how you managed  
**[0:03:51-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:03:51):**  to balance those two seemingly opposed factors on your farm.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:03:57):**  Yeah for sure.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:04:00):**  So just to kind of recap your question, we're talking about efficiency versus diversity.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:04:07):**  And yeah that's been a big topic on my mind like for the past like really solid year and  
**[0:04:14-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:04:14):**  a half almost two years.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:04:16):**  I've been really feeling this tension between these ideas.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:04:22):**  Naturally as you said Oliver, diversity is kind of like you know it's obvious we don't  
**[0:04:28-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:04:28):**  want monocultures, that like leads to just a world of problems.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:04:32):**  All of which we're mostly familiar with, diseases and pests and you know just like buildup of  
**[0:04:38-0:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:04:38):**  certain challenges like pests and diseases and then like the reduction of certain minerals  
**[0:04:43-0:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:04:43):**  or elements and basically just leading to a lot of headaches in management and ecology  
**[0:04:50-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:04:50):**  as well.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:04:52):**  I also noticed just like I think a big attraction of permaculture and when I meet a lot of students  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:04:57):**  coming into permaculture for the first time it's like the idea of anti-monoculture and  
**[0:05:02-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:05:02):**  like pro-diversity is so strong that's like I think it's something that's easy to wrap  
**[0:05:07-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:05:07):**  our heads around.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:05:08):**  And so I think for me starting out I came with that same kind of idea like I had some  
**[0:05:14-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:05:14):**  farming experience.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:05:15):**  My uncle has a 60 acre cabbage farm so it's literally 60 acres of cabbage.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:05:21):**  He does grow two other vegetables but at different times so it's either 60 acres of lettuce,  
**[0:05:26-0:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:05:26):**  60 acres of cabbage mainly and then they do a chili peppers at the end.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:05:30):**  So I was like seeing all the challenges that monoculture in this vegetable farm led to  
**[0:05:37-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:05:37):**  and so when I came to permaculture I was like I'll never do that.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:05:40):**  We're going to grow as much diversity as possible.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:05:44):**  But now flash forward to last year when this topic has come up a lot.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:05:48):**  You could just picture a typical week in the Atila in Organics farm.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:05:52):**  We were raising 100 to 120 meat birds every month.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:05:57):**  So we were harvesting about 25 to 30 chickens a week.

**[0:06:51-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:06:51):**  who are willing to pay for it, all of that suffered like extremely.

**[0:06:57-0:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:06:57):**  And that doesn't even touch on like our food forest is so diverse.

**[0:07:07-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:07:07):**  to stop everything else and harvest them.

**[0:08:52-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:08:52):**  you were farming two and a half acres and none of the products that I mentioned were

**[0:10:02-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:10:02):**  number of things that are happening on the property.

**[0:10:12-0:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:10:12):**  So just because you have a food forest that has 80 plants in it if those plants aren't

**[0:11:07-0:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:11:07):**  to take one step back in order to get two steps forward.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:11:14):**  So the from the time management point of view the goats were taking the most amount of time.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:11:21):**  It really the way we managed our goat systems is a hour to an hour and a half walk in the  
**[0:11:29-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:11:29):**  morning before milking to get some green material in their stomachs.

**[0:11:37-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:11:37):**  So we're starting at six then after milking they rest a little and then there's another  
**[0:11:42-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:11:42):**  two hour walk followed by a greens chopping session for the evening and an afternoon milking.

**[0:11:54-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:11:54):**  in total about four to four and a half hours a day.

**[0:12:05-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:12:05):**  So that was one that was kind of instantly glaring at like flashing red lights like hey  
**[0:12:12-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:12:12):**  even though the milk is profitable and even though you could like take some steps to improve

**[0:12:22-0:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:12:22):**  It was just such a time drain on the farm so we kind of looked at freeing up our schedule  
**[0:12:27-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:12:27):**  as a priority which led us to chop the goats away.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:12:31):**  And I can tell a bit more of the story just as it goes so Abundant Edge research farm  
**[0:12:37-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:12:37):**  and production farm is our neighbors as many of you guys listening know.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:12:42):**  But basically we made a deal with Abundant Edge with you Oliver and Neil to get our goats  
**[0:12:48-0:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:12:48):**  off the farm for 15 months.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:12:51):**  So it was March 1st officially Abundant Edge took over the goat herd and started milking  
**[0:12:57-0:12:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:12:57):**  and started taking care of everything.

**[0:13:03-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:13:03):**  the next 15 months.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:13:06):**  And there's a lot of agreements kind of that went into this.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:13:09):**  I don't know if maybe you want to chime in on that in a second but for me it's really

**[0:13:16-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:13:16):**  You set off maybe in the field of sustainability thinking you can do everything yourself and  
**[0:13:20-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:13:20):**  then you realize like whoa this like way too much and just to have a good team of people  
**[0:13:25-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:13:25):**  and partnerships and collaborations is so invaluable.

**[0:13:33-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:13:33):**  really good health and actually take the production to another level to learn better ways to do  
**[0:13:38-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:13:38):**  it while it gives me a chance to focus on things that are happening.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:13:42):**  So I don't know how have the goats been working out for you.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:13:45):**  Man this agreement between the two of us.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:13:47):**  Well actually you know there are two organizations since your farm includes you know your whole  
**[0:13:52-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:13:52):**  team and Abundant Edge is quite a team at this point too has really I think benefited  
**[0:13:57-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:13:57):**  both of us at this stage.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:13:58):**  Now our homestead down just below your farm doesn't have the same goals of profitability  
**[0:14:05-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:14:05):**  just on farm products as is the goal of your farm.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:14:09):**  We're much more geared towards education and experimentation.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:14:13):**  So our goal with the outputs of the farm are more to break even and pay good salaries to  
**[0:14:21-0:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:14:21):**  the people who are helping us with the maintenance.

**[0:14:42-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:14:42):**  we need to produce and what products we need to turn that raw milk into in order to make

**[0:15:03-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:15:03):**  Things like walking them for you know a cumulative amount of almost three hours a day.

**[0:15:23-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:15:23):**  we can continue to grow the herd and get good offspring that we can either sell or just

**[0:15:42-0:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:15:42):**  of the goats while they're not giving a product.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:15:44):**  So it's quite a lot of factors to think about and to balance to figure out how to justify  
**[0:15:50-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-balance-between-diversity-and-efficiency-on-your-permaculture-farm-with-shad-qudsi-of-atitlan-organics-066/#t=0:15:50):**  that aspect of the farm.

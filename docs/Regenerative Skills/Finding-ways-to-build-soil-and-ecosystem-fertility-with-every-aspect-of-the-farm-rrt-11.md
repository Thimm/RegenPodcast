**[0:02:01-0:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:02:01):**  And Neil Haggerty on this side.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:02:04):**  Good to talk to everybody again, as we have been doing all day.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:02:09):**  So this has been a really eventful month.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:02:13):**  We've had a lot going on.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:02:15):**  We're right in the middle of the shift of the two major seasons of this area.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:02:19):**  Let's talk about some of the projects that we've been working on lately because there's  
**[0:02:23-0:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:02:23):**  a million of them.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:02:27):**  So Neil and I have been pretty focused on this client outreach kind of stuff, working  
**[0:02:33-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:02:33):**  on our sort of landscaping business that we have going on.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:02:38):**  It's going well.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:02:40):**  It does take a lot of our time, but we're finally seeing some fruits of our labor.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:02:45):**  It's great because it feeds our nursery, which is huge.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:02:50):**  To have people on demand ready to buy plants off of us, ready to buy compost is great.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:02:58):**  It's not a work in vain in any way.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:03:01):**  It sets up a lot of important links.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:03:04):**  Well how's sort of the process of how you plan that out?  
**[0:03:06-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:03:06):**  Do you try and get the clients first, figure out what plants they need, then propagate  
**[0:03:10-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:03:10):**  them and then sell them?  
**[0:03:11-0:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:03:11):**  Or have we been doing it in a different order?  
**[0:03:14-0:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:03:14):**  It kind of works in both ways.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:03:15):**  Sometimes people call us and are like, hey, we need seeds.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:03:19):**  They're like, alright.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:03:21):**  Well seeds are great, but how about we offer you a service where we can make sure that  
**[0:03:26-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:03:26):**  your garden really flourishes.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:03:28):**  So sometimes we get jobs from the nursery itself, so they feed off of each other.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:03:33):**  Otherwise it would just be way too much work, way too far out of our way to really make  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:03:39):**  sense for being efficient with everything that we're doing here.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:03:44):**  We definitely have a focus in our nursery on stuff that grows well here, like native  
**[0:03:51-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:03:51):**  heirloom plants.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:03:54):**  Those are the ones that look best, they're the lowest maintenance.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:03:58):**  It's great we've got this whole system started now where we're training up local workers  
**[0:04:03-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:04:03):**  and creating some employment with the local people.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:04:09):**  A lot of what we plant in our, it's fun because we do our gardens where people can grow their  
**[0:04:15-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:04:15):**  veg and their annual stuff, but we always border it with a lot of perennial species  
**[0:04:20-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:04:20):**  that do all the things we've talked about before, fix nitrogen, give shade, break wind.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:04:26):**  But also the more I see it, provide habitat.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:04:31):**  We get to plant a lot of these species that we love, like this kind of nitrogen fixing  
**[0:04:37-0:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:04:37):**  native hardwoods around the perimeters of properties that are otherwise not valued and  
**[0:04:43-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:04:43):**  going in danger of them.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:04:44):**  We can propagate them, we propagate them here and move them on.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:04:49):**  A lot of what we're seeing now is the need to pay attention to the business aspect of  
**[0:04:54-0:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:04:54):**  running the farm because we only have an acre here.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:04:56):**  So we need to make it, we need to generate abundance on the land and then move it so  
**[0:05:02-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:05:02):**  that we can keep the cash flow going and keep investing and keep this place chugging along.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:05:07):**  So it's kind of like a balancing act.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:05:09):**  It's a little bit, honestly, a little bit exhausting at times, but it's fun.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:05:14):**  We constantly need to check in and see, is that horizon point still where we're trying  
**[0:05:22-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:05:22):**  to go with things?

**[0:05:27-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:05:27):**  new things that occupy our time and our investments as well?  
**[0:05:32-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:05:32):**  Reinvesting in certain things is huge.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:05:34):**  And pivoting with the things that change in the seasons, like we're just coming out of  
**[0:05:38-0:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:05:38):**  the rainy season right now and getting back and irrigating the entire market garden, but

**[0:05:49-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:05:49):**  care of themselves now need to kind of be babied a little bit more.

**[0:06:12-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:06:12):**  or midway through rainy season, they need, most lately need watering so that they can,  
**[0:06:18-0:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:06:18):**  I think the trick is to kind of get them in the ground early in the rainy season.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:06:24):**  Ready?

**[0:06:29-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:06:29):**  Yeah, you know, get them in the ground at the, you know, early in the rainy season so  
**[0:06:34-0:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:06:34):**  that they get established during that first season, maintain them over the dry season.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:06:39):**  That's the tricky part of talking to people who've like trying to be, trying to reforest  
**[0:06:44-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:06:44):**  pieces of land where there's no water and it is tough because I feel like rainy seasons  
**[0:06:49-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:06:49):**  are getting, the rains becoming more infrequent and heavier so harder to absorb for plants.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:06:54):**  So if you don't have irrigation, it's tough.  
**[0:06:57-0:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:06:57):**  Luckily we do so.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:06:59):**  Yeah, I think the trick is to get them, get them through that first rainy season, maintain

**[0:07:08-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:07:08):**  they can just jump.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:07:09):**  They're good at that point.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:07:10):**  They're good at that point.

**[0:07:15-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:07:15):**  like the excavation.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:07:18):**  You know, if you don't have enough time to water them, you know, you dig a bigger hole,  
**[0:07:23-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:07:23):**  you add more carbon rich organic compost as you can.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:07:29):**  Even like semi unbroken down stuff is great actually because it's obviously very high  
**[0:07:36-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:07:36):**  carbon content.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:07:37):**  It hasn't like exhausted a lot of the carbon so that will store a lot more water.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:07:41):**  That'll help loads and also keep the microbial community active down below the plant.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:07:48):**  And is this what you guys have been doing for the avocado reforestation project that  
**[0:07:52-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:07:52):**  you just completed this last week?  
**[0:07:54-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:07:54):**  Because I know that there's been some tricks with getting involvement from the owners of  
**[0:07:58-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:07:58):**  the land, but there are some other things that you can do to help to cut down on the  
**[0:08:02-0:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:08:02):**  maintenance in order to get a better success rate for the plants and the trees that you  
**[0:08:08-0:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:08:08):**  do put in.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:08:09):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:08:10):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:08:11):**  I mean, that's why earthworks are really important.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:08:12):**  That's why all tree planting should be preceded by some kind of appropriate form of earthworks,  
**[0:08:21-0:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:08:21):**  even if it's just putting dead barriers on contour across the land so that when rain  
**[0:08:25-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:08:25):**  does fall, it actually soaks in.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:08:27):**  And as Jair says, so much of it comes down to the carbon content of the soil, even if  
**[0:08:32-0:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:08:32):**  you've got a big piece of land and you can't do these like extensive soil remediations,  
**[0:08:39-0:08:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:08:39):**  just planting the plants in like a good, you know, in a good well dug hole with plenty  
**[0:08:46-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:08:46):**  of compost in it and some kind of earthworks alongside that.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:08:51):**  So yeah, that's why here it's pretty simple here.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:08:53):**  It's rocky soil, so you need to move the rocks downhill, place them across contour in a kind  
**[0:08:58-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:08:58):**  of a stable form.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:09:01):**  You know, and so doing that, but also we're only doing the reforestation now on areas  
**[0:09:06-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:09:06):**  close to our land over the dry season so that we can irrigate those plants.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:09:10):**  I kind of, it seems counterintuitive to even try and plant trees here in dry season, but  
**[0:09:16-0:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:09:16):**  you actually can.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:09:17):**  Again, if you give them a nice start, it's almost like putting them out into a nursery.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:09:21):**  It does work in a sense because then if they get water a couple of times a week over the  
**[0:09:26-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:09:26):**  dry season, which we're able to do because of our neighbour's land, we use the same  
**[0:09:31-0:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:09:31):**  water lines that we have going onto our land.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:09:35):**  And yeah, then hopefully they've got their, they've got a decent root system in so that  
**[0:09:39-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:09:39):**  they can just take off during the dry season, during the rainy season.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:09:44):**  And yeah, I think, I mean, this is, this is the tricky thing about doing community projects.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:09:48):**  It is getting buy in from people is tough and you have to, it pushes you, you know,  
**[0:09:58-0:10:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:09:58):**  because you're like, yeah, we've started this project and we can say to local people, we  
**[0:10:03-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:10:03):**  will plant trees in your land.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:10:06):**  And it's, you know, you're, you get avocados, you get better shade for your coffee, you  
**[0:10:12-0:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:10:12):**  get all these nitrogen fixers, all these extra food crops.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:10:17):**  And yeah, most, that's what actually what's great about the coffee project is that, you  
**[0:10:23-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:10:23):**  know, we've, we've put up this beneficial, this coffee processing unit, and we're buying,  
**[0:10:28-0:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:10:28):**  we're buying coffee off coffee farmers, and you can establish a relationship and trust  
**[0:10:32-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:10:32):**  with people that way.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:10:33):**  So now people who come in and I say, Oh, yeah, by the way, you've got a coffee field, how  
**[0:10:37-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:10:37):**  would you feel about us planting native trees and avocados and heirloom avocados on it.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:10:44):**  And you can kind of tell, you can sort of tell the guys who will look after those trees  
**[0:10:49-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:10:49):**  because really right now, yeah, we are, we're starting small with this reforestation project,  
**[0:10:55-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:10:55):**  we're working mostly with our neighbours and disappointingly, somewhat the reception from

**[0:11:04-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:11:04):**  cool, I guess, do we have to do anything?  
**[0:11:06-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:11:06):**  Right, you know, which is like, not really the response I was looking for, but, you know,

**[0:11:33-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:11:33):**  Let's, you know, let's do this with my, with my spot, you know, I'm happy to do it.

**[0:11:40-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:11:40):**  It was the same with the coffee.

**[0:11:56-0:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:11:56):**  we buy too, as per the criteria that Tim who buys the dried peregrino off of us.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:12:04):**  Yeah, Tim, we did the, we did the, actually, let's, yeah, let's come back to talking about

**[0:12:12-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:12:12):**  I wanted to get back to a question that actually came up on one of our farm tours.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:12:17):**  We had a friend from a community next to us come over and was interested in buying compost.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:12:24):**  And he said to us that he was trying to re, kind of reestablish better quality soil on  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:12:30):**  this, this very heavy slope that he has quite far up the valley.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:12:35):**  And he's got about three acres and was thinking of covering all of that with the compost that  
**[0:12:41-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:12:41):**  we, that we sell.

**[0:12:47-0:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:12:47):**  And it's a very, very impractical and inefficient way to boost soil unless you just have unlimited  
**[0:12:53-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:12:53):**  money and labor.

**[0:13:02-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:13:02):**  especially in this kind of wet dry tropics where we live and on the slopes that we're

**[0:13:13-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:13:13):**  know, projects on marginal lands.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:13:17):**  The first thing you want to try to figure out is how can you get these earthworks rolling,  
**[0:13:20-0:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:13:20):**  especially during the dry season because you're not planting, you know, you're, if you're  
**[0:13:26-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:13:26):**  in earthworks phase, you just, you know, move an earth all around the area.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:13:29):**  You're not going to plant anyways and it's dry as well.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:13:33):**  So I mean, in my experience, it's a lot easier to excavate dry soil than wet soil when it's  
**[0:13:38-0:13:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:13:38):**  sticking mud like that.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:13:40):**  Oh, forget about it.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:13:41):**  It doubles your labor.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:13:42):**  And then you've got erosion issues to deal with.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:13:44):**  Whereas if you get it all set up during the dry season, you're ready to go with it.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:13:48):**  And in terms of fertility, if you can get the earthworks set up in just, you know, three  
**[0:13:54-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:13:54):**  years with everything growing in, it'll be accumulating so much, so many more resources  
**[0:13:59-0:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:13:59):**  than it would have initially that, you know, you can calculate how much organic matter  
**[0:14:04-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:14:04):**  is being collected on the land.

**[0:14:10-0:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:14:10):**  you'll have collected all that carbon matter.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:14:12):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:14:13):**  Plus if you do the opposite, if you just go dumping compost on lands that have good water  
**[0:14:19-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:14:19):**  it'll just erode off even, you know, it's the first stuff that will get eroded away.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:14:24):**  I mean, in general here, in any climate, I think using vegetation to build up, to build

**[0:15:21-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:15:21):**  There's reams of stuff on this, you know, anyone interested in like large scale regeneration

**[0:15:42-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:15:42):**  In the tropics, me and Gerard were talking about this, like in the tropics, it's not

**[0:15:54-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:15:54):**  on, I mean, essentially the point for me is like, if the natural ecosystem looks like  
**[0:16:04-0:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:16:04):**  a savannah land or would have a lot of grasses on it, or at least would have grasses as being

**[0:16:17-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:16:17):**  bores are a great strategy.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:16:19):**  But here on steep lands in the tropics where you have like, where really grasses are barely  
**[0:16:24-0:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:16:24):**  part of the succession, things want to go back to being densely forested here very,

**[0:16:30-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:16:30):**  So it's like not the model you would use.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:16:33):**  We're lucky that we have a lot of forest edge habitat with the river for our animal system  
**[0:16:38-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:16:38):**  because that's what goats like and it's good for it.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:16:40):**  The goats do really well in this.

**[0:16:44-0:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:16:44):**  Goats are amazing here.

**[0:16:53-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:16:53):**  I mean, we don't have the luxury here of being able to fence off huge areas of property and  
**[0:16:59-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:16:59):**  rotate goats around.

**[0:17:05-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:17:05):**  the geography doesn't lend itself as well.

**[0:17:12-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:17:12):**  pasture and to, you know, we have a river here, so we have a lot of areas that are just  
**[0:17:18-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:17:18):**  green, that aren't really suitable to plant down all year round.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:17:22):**  The goats can go and we basically just accumulate all this stuff from around us.

**[0:17:31-0:17:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:17:31):**  We have these like river edges and they're just like, yes, sprawling with growth all

**[0:17:59-0:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:17:59):**  That's like, that's basically what your fertility comes down to.

**[0:18:27-0:18:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:18:27):**  from directly within the farming models that we have, aside from with the grazing of the

**[0:18:40-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:18:40):**  We actually had Tim come by today and look over how we're doing, make some minor tweaks  
**[0:18:45-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:18:45):**  and continue on.

**[0:18:53-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:18:53):**  in the landscape and can contribute to carbon and nutrition in the landscape.  
**[0:18:57-0:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:18:57):**  So let's start with the coffee benefits here.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:18:59):**  Jeremy, tell us a little bit about, first of all, the basic model of how it runs and  
**[0:19:04-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:19:04):**  the fertility that we get from it as a byproduct.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:19:07):**  All right.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:19:08):**  Yeah, so we're really just figuring out how to utilize a lot of this stuff, but we're  
**[0:19:13-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:19:13):**  really excited about it.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:19:16):**  Basically you ferment, you start by de-pulping the fruit that we buy and we have a big sort  
**[0:19:24-0:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:19:24):**  of like area of discernment with what we purchase off of people.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:19:29):**  And that's actually the trickiest part.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:19:31):**  Everything else seems to be easy going, but discerning what's the good various, it turns

**[0:19:41-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:19:41):**  people's harvest and just making sure that it's...  
**[0:19:45-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:19:45):**  It's worth buying at the price that we're buying because we are buying at about 25%  
**[0:19:50-0:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:19:50):**  higher than what they're able to get from the other buyers in the valley, right?  
**[0:19:55-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:19:55):**  Right.

**[0:19:58-0:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:19:58):**  We're just like, yes, give me that.

**[0:20:07-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:20:07):**  of the bean underneath is very important.

**[0:20:13-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:20:13):**  process is easy going.

**[0:20:27-0:20:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:20:27):**  Some of it goes into the animal house as well, like depending...

**[0:33:48-0:33:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:33:48):**  Oh yeah, shout outs to Lorenzo.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:33:50):**  Fuck yeah.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:33:51):**  This is Lorenzo's idea, by the way.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:33:53):**  The podcast with Lorenzo further back.  
**[0:33:56-0:33:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:33:56):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:57-0:33:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:33:57):**  I actually interviewed him.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:33:58):**  So it's better.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:34:00):**  Actually, there's a fantastic agroforestry and ecological farming course with Lorenzo  
**[0:34:07-0:34:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:34:07):**  and Alex from Coaba Farms in Antigua coming up soon.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:34:10):**  So if you want to check that out, take a look at the courses tab on the website.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:34:15):**  Let's talk a little bit now about how the seemingly dead systems that we interact with  
**[0:34:20-0:34:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:34:20):**  on a daily basis can actually be transformed and contribute to the fertility of the land  
**[0:34:25-0:34:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:34:25):**  as well.

**[0:34:28-0:34:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:34:28):**  Most people think of buildings as these dead structures on the land and just need maintenance  
**[0:34:33-0:34:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:34:33):**  and aren't necessarily really interacting or contributing much.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:34:37):**  They're not sexy.

**[0:46:31-0:46:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:46:31):**  about it with the natural building side of things.

**[0:46:41-0:46:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:46:41):**  their goals and really get an idea of what they're aiming for before they just start  
**[0:46:45-0:46:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:46:45):**  putting things on the landscape which potentially could be really far from what they say that

**[0:46:59-0:47:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:46:59):**  you know.

**[0:47:02-0:47:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:47:02):**  It means expressing your goals, your dreams, your vision in as clear a way as possible  
**[0:47:09-0:47:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:47:09):**  and then assessing the land and seeing if there's a compatibility between those two.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:47:14):**  Where the overlap is?

**[0:47:22-0:47:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:47:22):**  the land.

**[0:47:32-0:47:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:47:32):**  The only times I struggle with designs is it's actually particularly hard when people

**[0:47:45-0:47:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:47:45):**  dream building that's been designed by an architect who didn't really see or understand  
**[0:47:50-0:47:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:47:50):**  the landscape at all and they have this like amazing graphic design that looks great on  
**[0:47:57-0:48:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:47:57):**  a video on a walkthrough but then when you actually look at the landscape it just yeah  
**[0:48:02-0:48:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:48:02):**  the dimensions fit but in terms of the topography of the landscape it doesn't work at all and  
**[0:48:08-0:48:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:48:08):**  so you end up forcing things forcing it in there and it's like and then the kind of like  
**[0:48:14-0:48:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:48:14):**  landscape suffers it's kind of in the wrong place you know one basic thing with buildings  
**[0:48:20-0:48:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:48:20):**  is you just have to put them in a place where the waste streams can be dealt with effectively  
**[0:48:25-0:48:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:48:25):**  downhill you don't just clunk them in there and and then react to everything that happens  
**[0:48:34-0:48:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:48:34):**  after that so yeah you know it all comes back to doing a holistic design as opposed to like  
**[0:48:41-0:48:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:48:41):**  first designing the house and then seeing where the leach field and the garden and the  
**[0:48:46-0:48:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:48:46):**  composting system you know it's you really the whole thing should flow together as one  
**[0:48:51-0:48:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:48:51):**  so none of these things housing that you know houses and landscapes ideally should not at  
**[0:48:56-0:49:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:48:56):**  all be designed as separate things but yeah it happens a lot honestly a lot of the time

**[0:50:58-0:51:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:50:58):**  bringing in community and interacting with the people that they want to spend their lives  
**[0:51:02-0:51:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:51:02):**  with those are sort of abstract things that a lot of people don't think about when they  
**[0:51:06-0:51:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:51:06):**  think about designing a building so this is usually when I start to walk people back to  
**[0:51:11-0:51:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:51:11):**  the beginning and talk about these intangible ideas of what it is that you want in your  
**[0:51:17-0:51:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:51:17):**  life and how a building can then facilitate those intangibles it definitely works into  
**[0:51:23-0:51:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:51:23):**  landscapes as well but again like you said usually by the time you've come in a lot of  
**[0:51:28-0:51:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:51:28):**  the perm or the yeah the permanent structures have already been installed and so this is  
**[0:51:33-0:51:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:51:33):**  when I really like working with you guys to kind of figure out how an entire ecosystem  
**[0:51:38-0:51:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:51:38):**  can include the the buildings which you know are not dynamic they are usually degrading  
**[0:51:43-0:51:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:51:43):**  over the time they are dynamic though but they're contributors yeah if they're designed  
**[0:51:48-0:51:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:51:48):**  correctly you know roof water is always a huge one that varies massively depending on  
**[0:51:54-0:52:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:51:54):**  the climate you're in the micro climates created by structures like that too yeah the it's  
**[0:52:02-0:52:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:52:02):**  a huge dynamic element coming out of them roof water grey water black water especially  
**[0:52:07-0:52:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:52:07):**  in dry climates can be potentially the biggest water source for almost the entire year it  
**[0:52:12-0:52:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:52:12):**  definitely is and it always is you know I mean here it's different here you need to  
**[0:52:18-0:52:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:52:18):**  actually get here that's the one I find a source of water that I'm okay with letting  
**[0:52:23-0:52:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:52:23):**  go clean water yeah and here where you have like you know 18 centimeters of water falling  
**[0:52:32-0:52:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:52:32):**  in a severe event you don't need to try and hang on to all that water no drainage is important  
**[0:52:37-0:52:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:52:37):**  at that time is important you need and and it's clean water it's distilled water so if  
**[0:52:42-0:52:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:52:42):**  that's going back down to the lake that I'm fine with that you know and again because  
**[0:52:48-0:52:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:52:48):**  we have a river here near us drinking water is never an issue it's just a couple easy  
**[0:52:52-0:53:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:52:52):**  filtration steps away from being drinkable so but yeah you're talking about huge huge  
**[0:53:01-0:53:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:53:01):**  quantities of water that get hit it hit the roof and get moved through a house and again  
**[0:53:07-0:53:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:53:07):**  just making sure that those moves through the landscape appropriately is is really really  
**[0:53:12-0:53:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:53:12):**  important yeah I mean buildings really are the epicenter of energy collection and dispersal  
**[0:53:20-0:53:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:53:20):**  and in a relative location as well like where the building where the other elements on the  
**[0:53:26-0:53:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:53:26):**  on the landscape are situated in relationship to the building is definitely hugely important  
**[0:53:31-0:53:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:53:31):**  yeah that that sighting portion of putting in a building is arguably more important than  
**[0:53:37-0:53:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:53:37):**  any of the other design components later because no matter how well you design the structure  
**[0:53:41-0:53:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:53:41):**  if you cited it poorly you can't overcome it being in a flood zone you can't overcome  
**[0:53:47-0:53:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:53:47):**  it being always in the shade on the north slope of a mountain or something you know  
**[0:53:53-0:53:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:53:53):**  but those things are really basic and the landscape does dictate them too they are basic  
**[0:53:58-0:54:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:53:58):**  but you'd be amazed at how many of the buildings are constructed without considering them oh  
**[0:54:03-0:54:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:54:03):**  yeah I mean look the thing about getting into this kind of like holistic design sort of  
**[0:54:09-0:54:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:54:09):**  thing and permaculture design is that you really realize that if you if you if you learn  
**[0:54:16-0:54:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:54:16):**  these principles and if you if you set yourself up in this that you know I sometimes say to  
**[0:54:22-0:54:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:54:22):**  our students that come here that you know if you understand contouring and and basic  
**[0:54:29-0:54:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:54:29):**  sort of key line design that you can learn in a couple of days you're already a better  
**[0:54:36-0:54:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:54:36):**  landman you're already potentially a better land manager than professional agricultural  
**[0:54:43-0:54:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:54:43):**  engineers and and and who don't consider those who don't consider those things and so the  
**[0:54:49-0:54:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:54:49):**  work they do even though you know they're highly competent at those things that they  
**[0:54:54-0:55:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:54:54):**  have learned from a very focused engineering point of view can sometimes is often very  
**[0:55:01-0:55:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:55:01):**  competent work but the damage it does over the years that those structures or those those  
**[0:55:07-0:55:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:55:07):**  projects are in places is enormous you know because of these sort of basic things that  
**[0:55:11-0:55:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:55:11):**  they don't take into account. Indeed well we're going to start to wrap up on that note  
**[0:55:17-0:55:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:55:17):**  if anybody is interested in finding more about the details of how we walk through our own

**[0:55:27-0:55:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:55:27):**  about two or three months ago now all on the abundant edge design criteria checklist so  
**[0:55:33-0:55:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:55:33):**  I'll leave links to that in the show notes for this episode and we'll wrap things up

**[0:55:45-0:55:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:55:45):**  project with the algae smithc. Yeah I'm sure that will be well advanced by then I have  
**[0:55:50-0:55:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:55:50):**  no doubt. It'll already be like a fortune 500 company probably. Yeah quite likely man  
**[0:55:56-0:56:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-finding-ways-to-build-soil-and-ecosystem-fertility-with-every-aspect-of-the-farm-rrt-11/#t=0:55:56):**  I'll just be happy if we've all got working bathrooms by then that's the next milestone

### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 18:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:00:13):**  Here we dive deep into the diverse worlds of regenerative living, permaculture, and  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:00:17):**  natural building as we aspire to help you reach your highest potential for yourself,  
**[0:00:22-0:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:00:22):**  for your community, and for this beautiful planet that we share.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:00:25):**  As always, I'm your host Oliver Gaucher, and I'm thrilled to guide you through this  
**[0:00:29-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:00:29):**  week's episode, so let's jump right in!  
**[0:01:00-0:01:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:01:00):**  I've been so fortunate to get to speak directly with so many people who have created incredible  
**[0:01:04-0:01:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:01:04):**  examples of permaculture abundance and ecological health and resilience through this podcast.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:01:10):**  And though I've gotten to visit many permaculture projects and practitioners, many of the ones  
**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:01:14):**  that I've seen in person are either just in the early stages of getting off the ground,  
**[0:01:19-0:01:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:01:19):**  or haven't quite found their balance between financial and ecological prosperity.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:01:24):**  The best examples that I've seen in person are the projects that Alex Kronick and his  
**[0:01:27-0:01:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:01:27):**  team have managed in the area around Antigua Guatemala, namely, Coaba Farms and his new  
**[0:01:32-0:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:01:32):**  project in Paramos.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:01:34):**  Now back in Season 2, Neil Hegarty, who I used to work with on the Gran Haciqin project,  
**[0:01:40-0:01:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:01:40):**  interviewed Alex in an interview called, The Most Impressive Permaculturalist That You've  
**[0:01:43-0:01:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:01:43):**  Never Heard Of.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:01:45):**  And since then, I've been back many times to visit Alex both at his farm slash event  
**[0:01:50-0:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:01:50):**  space slash restaurant at Coaba Farms, and even more notably, the larger project that  
**[0:01:55-0:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:01:55):**  has been underway for just a couple years in the town of Paramos, northwest of Antigua.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:02:01):**  There Alex has been combining pieces of land that he's been able to acquire as he builds  
**[0:02:05-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:02:05):**  towards his dream of restoring the native forests of that region and strategically  
**[0:02:09-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:02:09):**  incorporate agroforestry, market gardening, ecotourism, and event space to ensure the  
**[0:02:15-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:02:15):**  value and protection of the native ecosystem is preserved indefinitely.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:02:19):**  Now though I didn't have the time to bring recording equipment along on the few trips  
**[0:02:23-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:02:23):**  that I made up there in person, I got to catch Alex on a call later to ask him to go over  
**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:02:29):**  a few of the many intricacies of his plan and steps for development that are still in  
**[0:02:33-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:02:33):**  the early stages but gaining incredible traction on his site.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:02:38):**  In this interview we cover many of the details of the unique climate and context where the  
**[0:02:42-0:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:02:42):**  land is located and how it informs goals and designs that Alex is developing.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:02:48):**  He talks at length about how he and his team are choosing which of the native species to  
**[0:02:52-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:02:52):**  propagate and use for reforestation and how they are creating nurseries to grow thousands  
**[0:02:56-0:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:02:56):**  of trees at a time.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:02:59):**  We also talk about how the government incentives for reforestation in Guatemala are not as  
**[0:03:04-0:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:03:04):**  beneficial as they might appear and how navigating the regulations can both help and hinder ecological  
**[0:03:09-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:03:09):**  goals.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:03:11):**  We even cover how different trees can affect the water table on your land, passive irrigation  
**[0:03:15-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:03:15):**  methods, even education programs for school-aged kids, and much more.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:03:20):**  I've learned so much from Alex and his methodical approach to land-based projects.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:03:24):**  He's definitely one of the voices in permaculture and ecological business that I hope more people  
**[0:03:28-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:03:28):**  look to and reference as examples of no-nonsense, results-based progress.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:03:34):**  I've also included a bunch of pictures from his farm and nursery that Alex sent to me  
**[0:03:38-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:03:38):**  and you can check them all out at the website at AbundantEdge.com.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:03:42):**  There are a few moments of bad reception from the internet call, but they only last a few  
**[0:03:46-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:03:46):**  seconds and it's not hard to follow.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:03:48):**  So with that said, I'll hand things over now to Alex.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:03:51):**  Hey, Alex, thanks so much for making the time today.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:03:54):**  How are you doing, man?  
**[0:03:55-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:03:55):**  I'm doing good.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:03:56):**  It's a great day here in Guatemala.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:00):**  No rain, which we need, but other than that, it's a nice day.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:05):**  Nice.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:06):**  Now, so you guys are in the rainy season right now.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:08):**  You said you've got a dry day today, but you've got so many other things going on with your  
**[0:04:11-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:11):**  life.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:12):**  You're splitting your time between multiple businesses, multiple land projects.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:16):**  You just recently had a child.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:17):**  Congratulations on that.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:19):**  Thanks.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:20):**  Yeah.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:21):**  Lots of big changes.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:22):**  I actually quit my other job last week, so I'm full time now at the farm.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:26):**  Whoa, that's a big step.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:27):**  Congratulations on that as well.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:29):**  Yeah.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:30):**  We'll spend more time with my daughter and wife.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:33):**  Figured they're worth it.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:36):**  You never get that time back.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:37):**  Now look, so we did a previous interview with you.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:39):**  It was Neil who did the interview with you last time.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:42):**  And so we'll breeze past your background because if anybody is interested, they can check out  
**[0:04:47-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:47):**  the previous episode that we did called the best permaculture list that you've never heard  
**[0:04:52-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:52):**  of.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:53):**  So you grew up mostly in Guatemala, but you split your time between the US and Guatemala  
**[0:04:58-0:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:58):**  for a while.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:59):**  We talked in the last episode about your project in Antigua, Koaba Farms.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:05:05):**  And until now, you've been known mostly in your community and around the world as the  
**[0:05:09-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:05:09):**  founder of Koaba Farms in Antigua, Guatemala, which has been featured in the New York Times.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:05:14):**  You had a lot of success with that project.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:05:18):**  Like I said, any listeners who are interested in that can go and see the previous episode.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:05:22):**  But let's talk about now your project in Paramos, which is a town about 40, 45 minutes drive  
**[0:05:28-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:05:28):**  away from Antigua.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:05:29):**  Half an hour.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:05:31):**  About half an hour.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:05:32):**  Oh, about half an hour.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:05:33):**  Good.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:05:34):**  Not too far to go.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:05:35):**  And I've been out there to visit a couple of times, but it's been a few months since  
**[0:05:38-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:05:38):**  I've seen you now that I've moved out to Spain.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:05:40):**  So tell me a little bit about the vision for this project and kind of set the scene for  
**[0:05:45-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:05:45):**  me.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:05:46):**  What kind of terrain are you working with and what's the overall vision?  
**[0:05:49-0:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:05:49):**  Okay, so Paramos is a much different project than Koaba Farms here in town.  
**[0:05:55-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:05:55):**  It's three acres in town, but Paramos is 200 acres and expanding as we're looking to buy  
**[0:06:02-0:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:06:02):**  more land as it comes.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:06:05):**  I have businesses interested in investing for growth in it.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:06:12):**  And the idea behind it is more reforestation, greening the mountains, getting more water,  
**[0:06:23-0:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:06:23):**  and biodiversity in the species that are around.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:06:26):**  So that's the overall project with the idea of bringing in tourists, which we already  
**[0:06:32-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:06:32):**  get a lot to the farm in town, taking one out there to do a little bit more of an extensive  
**[0:06:42-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:06:42):**  visit in terms of housing and staying the night or two, and eating, but also walking  
**[0:06:50-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:06:50):**  through the forest, seeing wildlife, and understanding what the concept is.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:06:57):**  Now, you are also still kind of producing food crops there as well.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:07:04):**  You've got something about, if I remember correctly from the last time I was out there,  
**[0:07:08-0:07:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:07:08):**  it's about a 60-40 split, 60% of the vegetables and the food that you produce for market being  
**[0:07:14-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:07:14):**  set out in that land in Paramos and about 40 at Koaba Farms, mostly just because it's  
**[0:07:19-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:07:19):**  a much smaller operation.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:07:21):**  Is that right?  
**[0:07:22-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:07:22):**  Yeah, that's correct.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:07:24):**  And so you're kind of in this very hilly, mountain-y terrain, actually in both sites,  
**[0:07:30-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:07:30):**  but because the site in Antigua is smaller, it's not on such a pendiente, a disleveled  
**[0:07:37-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:07:37):**  surface.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:07:38):**  But out in Paramos, you've got serious declines going into this valley, and there's probably  
**[0:07:45-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:07:45):**  a ton of microclimates in there.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:07:47):**  How did you kind of decide on where to focus on producing your crops and where to focus  
**[0:07:51-0:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:07:51):**  on reforestation?  
**[0:07:53-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:07:53):**  So I focused on where to plant crops based on where there wasn't forest.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:07:57):**  I'm not going to cut down forest to plant trees, to plant veggies or other items.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:08:02):**  So I'm protecting the forest that's already there.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:08:04):**  So I chose areas that were already deforested since the land that we've got there has been  
**[0:08:10-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:08:10):**  purchased through multiple neighbors.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:08:12):**  So we started with one decent-sized property, and we've been buying out the neighbors little  
**[0:08:16-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:08:16):**  by little.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:08:17):**  And so choosing areas that are not forested, have a good sun exposure, and very important,  
**[0:08:25-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:08:25):**  there's springs.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:08:27):**  And so choosing areas where we can gravity feed from the springs.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:08:31):**  Those were the most optimal areas.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:08:36):**  That doesn't mean we can't farm elsewhere, but in order to get the most out of the resources  
**[0:08:44-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:08:44):**  there, those were the areas that were chosen.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:08:45):**  And there was plenty of them, so that's where we're at.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:08:47):**  Sure.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:08:48):**  Now give me an idea of how degraded the land was when you purchased it.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:08:51):**  Because like you said, it had gone through many previous owners, many of whom had kind  
**[0:08:56-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:08:56):**  of deforested the terrain, and others who had planted perhaps different crops like avocados,  
**[0:09:05-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:09:05):**  or perhaps used it as pasture land in the past.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:09:08):**  And you've got quite a diversity.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:09:10):**  Most people who we bought the land from were planting vegetables for export, basically  
**[0:09:19-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:09:19):**  on certain seasons.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:09:20):**  And then on the other seasons, they were planting corn and beans, their staple foods.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:09:24):**  But everything was done non-organic, and therefore we had to go, we've been doing processes to  
**[0:09:29-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:09:29):**  clean out all the trails, all the traces of all those things, by letting it weed, collecting  
**[0:09:36-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:09:36):**  then the weeds, planting certain types of crops that absorb these nutrients, and then  
**[0:09:44-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:09:44):**  using it for animal feed, and then getting into actual planting of crops.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:09:52):**  And what kind of plants have you been using for the remediation of the land?  
**[0:09:57-0:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:09:57):**  We've been using like daikons.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:09:59):**  Those seem to be very well, you know, they're like these big roots, radishes, and they tend  
**[0:10:05-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:10:05):**  to loosen up the soil, absorb all the heavy metals, and any salts, and all sorts of other  
**[0:10:13-0:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:10:13):**  stuff left behind.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:10:17):**  So we've been using that, and fodderbeets, I guess that's how you call them, fodderbeets.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:10:23):**  So those have been the main ones, followed by some legumes that are like, you can use  
**[0:10:29-0:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:10:29):**  as kind of like a chop and drop thing.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:10:32):**  So those have been more of the things we've been using to clean out the area.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:10:38):**  Plus we left it at least a year, over a year, just weed out, and then took out all those  
**[0:10:44-0:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:10:44):**  weeds and composted them somewhere else.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:10:48):**  And now you're saying you're feeding those a lot to your animals as well.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:10:51):**  You've got quite a number of different animals, and tell me a little bit about how you manage  
**[0:10:55-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:10:55):**  those in rotation and with different types of feed.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:10:59):**  Yeah, so we have pigs, we have lamb, we have ducks, we have chickens.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:11:06):**  Those are the animals we're running out there.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:11:08):**  And yeah, we just have them fenced in, in decent sized areas, and every so often we  
**[0:11:16-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:11:16):**  move them from one fenced area to the next, and then to the next, and behind either comes  
**[0:11:20-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:11:20):**  another animal or a crop.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:11:23):**  And then when it's greened again, we keep moving them back in.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:11:28):**  We use the water from the spring, and 50% of the time we're using corn that we grow  
**[0:11:33-0:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:11:33):**  at the farm, the other 50 we have to outsource it, try to get the best that we can when we're  
**[0:11:39-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:11:39):**  not growing our own.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:11:41):**  And we're starting to do all our hay bales so we can have a lot of dry food during the  
**[0:11:47-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:11:47):**  rainy season when they need dry food or else only green food's not enough.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:11:52):**  So we're working on trying to be as sustainable as possible with these animals, trying to  
**[0:11:57-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:11:57):**  feed them as much as possible from the farm.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:12:01):**  So that's really what we do.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:12:04):**  The only animals that I'm not too happy about are pigs when they're breastfeeding.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:12:09):**  I gotta kinda give them a supplement, but it's only during the milking process when  
**[0:12:16-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:12:16):**  they're feeding their babies.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:12:17):**  They tend to go very, very lean when they have 10, 12 piglets sucking on it 24-7.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:12:24):**  Yeah, I can imagine.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:12:27):**  Now tell me about the unique situation of your water resources there, because you're  
**[0:12:31-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:12:31):**  in the wet-dry tropics that I've talked about a lot on this podcast in the past, because  
**[0:12:35-0:12:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:12:35):**  it was a very similar climate to what we had there at the lake.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:12:39):**  But even though you get a huge amount of water in a certain season, it's almost completely  
**[0:12:43-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:12:43):**  dry for about half of the year.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:12:46):**  And given those big changes in elevation, how are you making sure that water gets where  
**[0:12:50-0:12:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:12:50):**  it needs to on the land?  
**[0:12:52-0:13:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:12:52):**  Yeah, so one of the main things is we're applying swales from all the roads where the  
**[0:13:03-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:13:03):**  carves come in into the property, plus in certain areas.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:13:07):**  It's such a big property, it's hard to do it on the whole thing.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:13:09):**  But we're moving little by little, putting swales here and there, some key lines.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:13:14):**  But also we're planting lots of forest, and planting lots of trees.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:13:21):**  I've been learning a lot about planting trees in that area, it's different everywhere you  
**[0:13:25-0:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:13:25):**  go.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:13:26):**  But let's say this year my goal was 10,000 trees, we weren't really able to plant 10,000,  
**[0:13:31-0:13:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:13:31):**  we got 5,000 in.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:13:32):**  So that's really good.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:13:35):**  I'm still happy with that amount.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:13:37):**  The difference between this and last year's, even though we planted a lot of trees last  
**[0:13:41-0:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:13:41):**  year, is last couple years we've been planting lots of trees and the majority have been dying  
**[0:13:47-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:13:47):**  out.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:13:48):**  We've been planting either too late in the rainy season and they're not sticking, or  
**[0:13:50-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:13:50):**  we've been planting too early in the rainy season and the weeds outgrow the trees.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:13:56):**  So this year we invested in some weed whackers, a lot more weed whackers and stuff to keep  
**[0:14:06-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:14:06):**  the weeds down when we're planting the trees.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:14:09):**  So we can tell already that most of them are going to succeed this year.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:14:14):**  So that's good.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:14:16):**  So our nurseries, basically we're not buying trees and we're not buying seed.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:14:22):**  That's what happens most of the time is most people are planting trees that are not from  
**[0:14:25-0:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:14:25):**  the area or are reforesting with non-native species.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:14:32):**  They're more like species that you can take advantage of, like lumber species, and therefore  
**[0:14:39-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:14:39):**  you disrupt a little bit, if not a lot, the system.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:14:45):**  So the idea is we're planting special species of the area where we're getting our own seed  
**[0:14:51-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:14:51):**  from our forests, we're making our own nurseries, and fortunately the species that we have in  
**[0:14:58-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:14:58):**  our native forest there, which are cloud forests, we're at 2100 meters elevation.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:15:06):**  So I guess not sure what that is in feet, but I'm guessing it's like 8,000 feet or something  
**[0:15:11-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:15:11):**  like that.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:15:13):**  Maybe something like that.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:15:15):**  But basically the species that we have in that native forest are species that put water  
**[0:15:21-0:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:15:21):**  into the ground and not suck water out of the ground, like eucalyptus or pine forests  
**[0:15:28-0:15:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:15:28):**  and cypress, which that's what most people plant in this area.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:15:34):**  But unfortunately they're great lumber, but instead of putting water in the ground, they're  
**[0:15:40-0:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:15:40):**  drying the ground up, and it's a very basic biodiversity that comes out of those species  
**[0:15:54-0:15:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:15:54):**  in that area, because those are great trees from even much higher elevation in areas where  
**[0:15:58-0:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:15:58):**  there's less biodiversity, so those would do well.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:16:01):**  But in our area, which is a cloud forest, which has lots of biodiversity, if you plant  
**[0:16:06-0:16:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:16:06):**  a monocrop of those trees, you get rid of too many species.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:16:14):**  So it's better to plant the local ones which retain more variety.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:16:19):**  Sure, sure.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:16:21):**  Let's step back a little bit, because I know that there are incentives for reforestation  
**[0:16:25-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:16:25):**  in Guatemala.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:16:27):**  The government is actually doing a fairly decent job about giving monetary incentives  
**[0:16:32-0:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:16:32):**  to farmers who have otherwise either cut down their own forests or have land where it has  
**[0:16:37-0:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:16:37):**  been deforested, and the money is significant enough to actually offer a really good motivation,  
**[0:16:44-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:16:44):**  especially if they're doing mostly cash crops and fairly subsistence farming.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:16:49):**  So where are the benefits to these policies, and where does it kind of hold back, especially  
**[0:16:55-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:16:55):**  when you're talking about biodiversity in these cases?  
**[0:16:58-0:17:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:16:58):**  Yeah, it's a complicated thing to touch, but basically I'm not a big fan of those incentives.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:17:08):**  I do do a little bit of them, because it helps you get a big ally in case of a neighbor trying  
**[0:17:15-0:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:17:15):**  to do something wrong or something happening nearby, you can put a little bit of halt and  
**[0:17:21-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:17:21):**  pressure on that.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:17:22):**  It's kind of a weird system, as though you have to hire a forest engineer that's certified  
**[0:17:31-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:17:31):**  by them, which you have to pay, and they're quite expensive to set up the program.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:17:42):**  My thing that I've seen about it is the money you're getting, it really just goes to pay  
**[0:17:47-0:17:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:17:47):**  the project.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:17:48):**  It's very hard to make money off of those systems.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:17:51):**  They're very good at just covering the costs of maintaining the forest and any expenses  
**[0:17:56-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:17:56):**  that need to go with it.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:17:57):**  But it's not like, oh, here's a forest, I got 20 acres, let's put it under the preserve  
**[0:18:04-0:18:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:18:04):**  thing.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:18:05):**  You're not making money.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:18:09):**  The money comes when the project is over and you're able to harvest what's there, which  
**[0:18:15-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:18:15):**  is what most of these projects are.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:18:17):**  Most of these projects are not set up to indefinite protect the forest forever.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:18:23):**  There are more projects like, okay, let's reforest with pine or with cypress and stuff  
**[0:18:28-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:18:28):**  like this.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:18:29):**  Then 10 years later, 20 years later, 30 years later, you're harvesting and that's where  
**[0:18:34-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:18:34):**  you're getting.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:18:35):**  Then you replant trees, because you have to replant there.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:18:39):**  You can't just clear cut.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:18:45):**  You're covering your cost to the point when you can harvest your yield there.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:18:53):**  That's where it's at.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:18:54):**  For someone like me, where I'm not in the plan of harvesting, I'm more in the plan of  
**[0:18:58-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:18:58):**  planting trees that are not the species that...  
**[0:19:02-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:19:02):**  What really happens is most of their projects, I'd say 90 if not more, their percentage is  
**[0:19:08-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:19:08):**  like three or four species.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:19:09):**  In my area, the species that they work with is eucalyptus, cypress, and pine.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:19:15):**  Tropical, much warmer climates, it would be teak or mahogany.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:19:20):**  The amount of species that they're setting up is very little compared to what a real  
**[0:19:24-0:19:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:19:24):**  forest offers.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:19:26):**  One of them is because there's not nurseries that sell other varieties and there's no studies  
**[0:19:30-0:19:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:19:30):**  for the other ones.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:19:31):**  They haven't really set up things for those other things because the programs are mostly  
**[0:19:36-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:19:36):**  for planting and then when they're ready, you're going to cut and take the yield out.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:19:41):**  Except for there's a different one which is protecting.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:19:44):**  Protecting is a different type of incentive where it's like you already have a virgin  
**[0:19:48-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:19:48):**  forest.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:19:49):**  You put it under a reserve and therefore they pay you for that and there you keep what's  
**[0:19:55-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:19:55):**  there.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:19:56):**  That's where the real biodiverse and stuff is happening.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:20:00):**  Where you're planting trees, it's very different to what I'm doing because I'm planting trees  
**[0:20:05-0:20:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:20:05):**  that they've never even heard of, I think.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:20:08):**  Very rare species.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:20:10):**  So I'm not going to really be getting a yield off of this so I'm just covering my costs.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:20:15):**  My yield off of this which I'm switching is agro-tourism where I can take tourists, walk  
**[0:20:21-0:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:20:21):**  them through there and show them birds and wildlife and that type of...  
**[0:20:28-0:20:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:20:28):**  That's going to be my yield out of the situation.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:20:30):**  But the other yield that I'm going to be getting off of it is putting more water into my soil  
**[0:20:34-0:20:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:20:34):**  because the trees that I'm planting are actually water friendly.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:20:37):**  Put water into the ground while as all these programs of reforestation for all these other  
**[0:20:41-0:20:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:20:41):**  places where it's for lumber, they're not water friendly.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:20:45):**  They're actually sucking up the water from the ground.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:20:48):**  I think their program, there's many things and there's a lot of loopholes in the system  
**[0:20:54-0:20:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:20:54):**  but at least they're doing something.  
**[0:20:57-0:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:20:57):**  It's moving forward.  
**[0:20:58-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:20:58):**  It is taking off.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:20:59):**  There's a lot more people being interested in the situation and that's in general really  
**[0:21:05-0:21:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:21:05):**  great for the country.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:21:06):**  So I think we're moving towards the right direction.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:21:09):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:21:10):**  Now tell me about the observation process that helped you to decide which of these kind  
**[0:21:16-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:21:16):**  of rarer and native species you wanted to propagate.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:21:20):**  Because like you said, it took you a while to kind of figure out, mostly because a lot  
**[0:21:24-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:21:24):**  of them are not available in nurseries or perhaps don't have a lot of studies or information  
**[0:21:28-0:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:21:28):**  that you can look up to get answers from.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:21:31):**  And if I remember correctly, you went around with a lot of local people from that area  
**[0:21:35-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:21:35):**  and that community who know the forest well to observe and figure out which of those kind  
**[0:21:40-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:21:40):**  of kept water in the soil, which were good habitat for biodiversity within like the birds  
**[0:21:47-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:21:47):**  and the fauna of the area.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:21:49):**  Tell me a little bit about that process.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:21:51):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:21:52):**  So it's just a lot of observation.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:21:54):**  I've been in that area for about eight years and I just started planting trees about three  
**[0:21:58-0:21:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:21:58):**  years ago.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:21:59):**  So it was about a five year observation before I knew what type of trees I've wanted to plant.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:22:05):**  I'd say 80% of the trees are native.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:22:07):**  I am introducing some other types of species for beneficial things, but mostly working  
**[0:22:15-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:22:15):**  with what I got there.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:22:18):**  I was saying, okay, what do birds eat in that area?  
**[0:22:20-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:22:20):**  What do wildlife eat in that area?  
**[0:22:23-0:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:22:23):**  If you want to bring in wildlife and birds and all that, that's the first thing you got  
**[0:22:26-0:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:22:26):**  to keep planting, you want more food, more abundance for them, shelter also, and therefore  
**[0:22:32-0:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:22:32):**  those were important.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:22:35):**  I kept seeing what was growing naturally near the water sources and I figured those were  
**[0:22:41-0:22:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:22:41):**  the water, the trees that were attracting water and we were discussing with the locals  
**[0:22:47-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:22:47):**  and everybody, they were in Concord or what you call it.  
**[0:22:55-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:22:55):**  They were in agreement with me and therefore I had to start then wondering when was the  
**[0:23:01-0:23:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:23:01):**  time when they're putting out seeds because each species is a different time when they're  
**[0:23:05-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:23:05):**  putting out seeds.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:23:06):**  And then trials as to how to germinate them and it wasn't easy.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:23:10):**  Sometimes we would just wait for the seeds to fall on the ground, sprout there naturally  
**[0:23:15-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:23:15):**  and then transplant the babies.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:23:18):**  After many years we've been getting better and better and I now got more ideas of how  
**[0:23:23-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:23:23):**  to do it even better next year and hopefully this will keep growing forever with this wisdom.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:23:30):**  We're planting about 14 varieties of local species of big trees, big trees that will  
**[0:23:37-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:23:37):**  grow the very big ones.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:23:39):**  Plus we're planting maybe another six varieties of medium sized trees that do well under the  
**[0:23:44-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:23:44):**  shade of the bigger ones.  
**[0:23:47-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:23:47):**  Because everything from nut trees to hardwoods to fruit trees to legume trees, they all play  
**[0:24:02-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:24:02):**  up all together.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:24:03):**  They play a good part, different levels.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:24:07):**  They all serve different functions in the whole system.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:24:12):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:24:15):**  So we're just not playing with one species and mono cropping it and then when the time's  
**[0:24:21-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:24:21):**  ready to harvest, you harvest, you clear cut and then you plant again, probably the same  
**[0:24:27-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:24:27):**  species again or something.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:24:29):**  So that's usually what the incentive programs are looking like these days for reforestation.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:24:34):**  It's not like, oh, we're going to plant a very cool forest with multiple variety and  
**[0:24:40-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:24:40):**  then never harvest it.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:24:41):**  If only that were the case.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:24:44):**  So I think where these programs come in and help a lot, you don't really have costs and  
**[0:24:51-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:24:51):**  then when you harvest, it's the big one because you don't have to, most of the time what you  
**[0:24:57-0:25:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:24:57):**  were doing, it's an investment for 10, 20, 30 years and then you start seeing some, so  
**[0:25:02-0:25:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:25:02):**  then you get the big harvest and then it pays off.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:25:04):**  Hopefully it pays off for all you've invested in the last 30 years and then more.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:25:10):**  With these forests, there's a few things because usually you plant very tight and then at five  
**[0:25:17-0:25:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:25:17):**  years you do what we call a raleo, what you call like you thin out and then there you  
**[0:25:23-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:25:23):**  get something and depending on the type of species, what do you do with that thin out?  
**[0:25:26-0:25:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:25:26):**  It could be posts, it could be this.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:25:28):**  Then you do a second thin out like around 10 years and then those could be beams and  
**[0:25:33-0:25:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:25:33):**  even bigger posts and then you do like a third, like around 15 or 20 years and then those  
**[0:25:38-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:25:38):**  can actually get, like already start with the chainsaw, getting bored, doing a little  
**[0:25:43-0:25:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:25:43):**  bit more cuts of lumber and then by 20, 30 years, depending on the species, you're harvesting  
**[0:25:48-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:25:48):**  the big ones and that's where you're getting the stuff.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:25:51):**  So I mean there is some money in between doing, but the idea behind the incentives is that  
**[0:25:57-0:25:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:25:57):**  it covers those things and stuff.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:25:59):**  So for every tree you plant, you're going to have to, for every tree you cut, you're  
**[0:26:02-0:26:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:26:02):**  going to have to keep planting and there's always studies and all this type of stuff  
**[0:26:06-0:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:26:06):**  and the way these studies, they're not set up for very big projects, they're set up more  
**[0:26:12-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:26:12):**  for smaller projects.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:26:14):**  So usually they'll pay you full price for let's say 15 hectares, which I'm guessing  
**[0:26:19-0:26:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:26:19):**  that's about 45 acres.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:26:26):**  So 45 acres, they will pay you full price on a project that's 45 acres, but if it gets  
**[0:26:32-0:26:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:26:32):**  bigger than 45 acres, then it really drastically decreases.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:26:36):**  So basically you get paid full price for 45 acres and for every acre above that, so if  
**[0:26:41-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:26:41):**  you have a 100 acre program or a 1000 acre program, let's say every acre after the 45  
**[0:26:47-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:26:47):**  you get a fifth or a tenth the amount.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:26:51):**  So if you were getting $100 per acre a year, that's $4500 a year, that's full price, then  
**[0:26:59-0:27:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:26:59):**  all of a sudden you're getting $10 an acre after that.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:27:05):**  So what that does, it's like big projects are not really happening because people would  
**[0:27:12-0:27:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:27:12):**  rather do one year or two, you know they do multiple small projects and they only let  
**[0:27:20-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:27:20):**  you put in so many small projects a year as a person or an identity.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:27:27):**  So you gotta wait until the next year and then put in another.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:27:30):**  So I mean it's set up, and in a certain way it's good because it's set up for all these  
**[0:27:36-0:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:27:36):**  more local people who are the people who really need to take care of the forest to set these  
**[0:27:41-0:27:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:27:41):**  programs up.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:27:42):**  So yeah, it's interesting.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:27:44):**  We'll see what happens in the future with more ideas.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:27:48):**  I've been talking with them a lot and telling them that I want to start out a big nursery  
**[0:27:56-0:28:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:27:56):**  and have all these types of trees and eventually when they have programs that don't want to  
**[0:28:00-0:28:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:28:00):**  go with the standard which is planting these lumber trees and they want to kind of go with  
**[0:28:05-0:28:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:28:05):**  what I'm doing, is either teaching them how to source their own seeds and their own nurseries  
**[0:28:09-0:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:28:09):**  and all this, or myself having a big nursery and maybe I can supply some of these other  
**[0:28:14-0:28:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:28:14):**  projects with these more local native species.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:28:19):**  That's longer down the road, but that's kind of where I'm heading towards.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:28:23):**  That's kind of an idea of mine.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:28:27):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:28:28):**  Seems like there's a lot of potential there, but it requires a good knowledge of how the  
**[0:28:32-0:28:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:28:32):**  systems work there, where the incentives are, where the limitations are, and that just kind  
**[0:28:36-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:28:36):**  of comes from being there all the time and talking with locals and navigating the system.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:28:42):**  Exactly.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:28:43):**  So let's talk about now some of the ways that you can incentivize this type of reforestation  
**[0:28:49-0:28:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:28:49):**  without having to rely on government subsidies or programs.  
**[0:28:53-0:29:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:28:53):**  Now you have a unique idea of turning this into more of a tourism or hospitality enterprise.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:29:03):**  And tell me a little bit about how you see that working or developing over time, although  
**[0:29:06-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:29:06):**  you may not have all the pieces set up yet.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:29:10):**  Yeah, well, you know, I think the future of tourism is moving towards sustainable, biodiverse,  
**[0:29:22-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:29:22):**  pro-tourism.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:29:23):**  I think people less and less want to go see nature and these type of things.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:29:32):**  It's not everybody, but it's a growth.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:29:36):**  These tour destination areas are becoming more and more like, okay, where is their forest?  
**[0:29:41-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:29:41):**  Where is their nature?  
**[0:29:42-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:29:42):**  Where can I connect?  
**[0:29:43-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:29:43):**  Yeah, they're becoming increasingly rare.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:29:45):**  I think it's a really good bet moving forward.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:29:48):**  I mean, we see in so many news stories and current events how much forests are being  
**[0:29:53-0:29:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:29:53):**  lost constantly and the biodiversity and the access to them with it.  
**[0:29:58-0:29:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:29:58):**  Exactly.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:29:59):**  So I think that's a future thing for business, unfortunately, because it should be nice to  
**[0:30:06-0:30:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:30:06):**  just go wherever you want and see nature.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:30:10):**  And especially nature where you understand nature, because a lot of people don't understand  
**[0:30:14-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:30:14):**  nature.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:30:15):**  So it's nice to go somewhere where there might be a guide or someone who can tell you about  
**[0:30:17-0:30:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:30:17):**  what's happening.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:30:18):**  Because what I see is different than what someone who's never been in my area sees.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:30:23):**  So it's like they would just walk and kind of be clueless of half the stuff unless you  
**[0:30:27-0:30:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:30:27):**  really know about the area or about the species or what's happening there.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:30:32):**  And so these type of agrotourisms where there's like a guide or someone talking about the  
**[0:30:37-0:30:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:30:37):**  situation I think is good.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:30:43):**  And also the idea is for healthiness and awareness.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:30:49):**  So talking about awareness and also simultaneously you're out there in nature, you're going to  
**[0:30:55-0:30:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:30:55):**  eat healthy food.  
**[0:30:56-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:30:56):**  You're going to have a very nice area to stay in.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:31:01):**  You're away from noise.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:31:02):**  You're going to hear birds.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:31:05):**  You're not going to hear the highway.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:31:06):**  You're not going to hear all sorts of things that come with being in a city.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:31:12):**  And if you're lucky you get to see other types of...  
**[0:31:20-0:31:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:31:20):**  Yeah, that's kind of where I'm pushing for.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:31:29):**  You escape for...  
**[0:31:30-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:31:30):**  And not just international tourism but local tourism as well.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:31:35):**  There's a lot of people in the city who have money and just never are in a forest or never  
**[0:31:40-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:31:40):**  are in a city and they want to get out for the weekend.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:31:43):**  And the beach could be a destination.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:31:46):**  The lake could be a destination.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:31:47):**  But the mountains could be a destination as well.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:31:50):**  And yeah, you go out there, you eat healthy.  
**[0:31:55-0:31:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:31:55):**  There's retreats.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:31:56):**  We can bring in special workshops whether it's meditation or whether it's yoga or whether  
**[0:32:03-0:32:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:32:03):**  it's people who are not cleansing.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:32:07):**  There's so much stuff out there nowadays.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:32:09):**  Just bringing the right person out there and offering the workshop.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:32:12):**  And in that type of environment, it's really nice.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:32:19):**  And then at the same time, not only nature, but you can see about the crops and how we  
**[0:32:23-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:32:23):**  grow the crops and how we become a sustainable project producing our own seeds, producing  
**[0:32:27-0:32:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:32:27):**  our own fertilizer and what you're eating.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:32:31):**  And it's this whole lifestyle, this whole system, so you can get more aware of it.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:32:41):**  Yeah.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:32:42):**  Yeah.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:32:43):**  And the nice thing is, perhaps, I think you know the owners of Hobbitonango too.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:32:49):**  The guys who took a risk on a concept up in the mountains outside of Antigua, similar  
**[0:32:57-0:33:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:32:57):**  distance in some ways from where your guys are situated and at this point they've got,  
**[0:33:02-0:33:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:33:02):**  they say 70 to 80% of their clientele from Guatemala, domestic tourism.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:33:07):**  And when they started that, they didn't really have any ambition that there would be that  
**[0:33:10-0:33:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:33:10):**  much interest within the local communities to go out and see natural areas.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:33:14):**  But now that's their bread and butter clientele.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:33:17):**  And it's really nice to see that there's kind of an awakening towards appreciation of the  
**[0:33:21-0:33:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:33:21):**  natural resources within the country.  
**[0:33:24-0:33:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:33:24):**  Whereas before I think there was maybe more of a value placed on going to the beach or  
**[0:33:28-0:33:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:33:28):**  going to other countries and starting to recognize how rich the ecosystems within that country  
**[0:33:34-0:33:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:33:34):**  are themselves.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:33:36):**  Exactly.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:33:37):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:33:39):**  So now let's talk a little bit about the unique circumstances that you have there.  
**[0:33:43-0:33:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:33:43):**  We talked a little bit about the terrain, the microclimate, the elevation where you  
**[0:33:47-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:33:47):**  are.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:33:48):**  Let's talk about some of the challenges.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:33:50):**  I lost you a little bit.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:33:53):**  You lost me there.  
**[0:33:54-0:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:33:54):**  Okay.  
**[0:33:55-0:33:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:33:55):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:56-0:33:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:33:56):**  Start out again.  
**[0:33:57-0:33:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:33:57):**  Sure.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:33:58):**  So let's, let's talk now a little bit about the challenges that you face in that scenario  
**[0:34:01-0:34:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:34:01):**  because one of the first times that I went out to see the site on Paramos, it was still  
**[0:34:06-0:34:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:34:06):**  recovering from a big ash plume that came from a volcano, which I mean, you're right  
**[0:34:12-0:34:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:34:12):**  in the area of that volcano.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:34:15):**  And there are a lot of things, not just as far as like natural disasters that can threaten  
**[0:34:20-0:34:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:34:20):**  the ecosystems there, especially when they've become brittle through deforestation, but  
**[0:34:24-0:34:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:34:24):**  also some of the difficulties of the way that your neighbors and other people in the area  
**[0:34:29-0:34:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:34:29):**  are managing their land.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:34:31):**  So can you talk about some of the challenges that you have in your reforestation efforts?  
**[0:34:35-0:34:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:34:35):**  Yeah.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:34:36):**  Like you said, neighbors who are just in the opposite instead of like planting trees or  
**[0:34:43-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:34:43):**  in the cutting trees, you know, so it's very complicated with that.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:34:49):**  Basically yeah.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:34:50):**  That whole volcano thing.  
**[0:34:52-0:34:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:34:52):**  I mean, we're not really in the, in the line, like you said, it just really depends on the,  
**[0:34:56-0:34:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:34:56):**  on the winds.  
**[0:34:57-0:35:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:34:57):**  If it blows up and the winds are on the direction that we're at, then that's where we get some  
**[0:35:02-0:35:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:35:02):**  troubles.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:35:03):**  But it's gotta be when it blows up hard because a little, a little, a little thing, even though  
**[0:35:07-0:35:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:35:07):**  the winds are towards our direction, but that will happen once every five years.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:35:11):**  And so that's something we have to put up with.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:35:13):**  I think the forest doesn't get bugged with that.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:35:15):**  I think we didn't have any issues with the forest.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:35:17):**  So planting forest is great.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:35:19):**  It doesn't, it's a, it's a, the agro-tourism and all that doesn't affect anything because  
**[0:35:24-0:35:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:35:24):**  doesn't really ruin the forest.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:35:26):**  What it does is it ruins our, you know, our vegetables and sometimes our fruit trees,  
**[0:35:32-0:35:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:35:32):**  if they're on flower or they have fruit on them.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:35:36):**  So that's where we have to watch out a bit.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:35:38):**  It doesn't really kill the fruit trees.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:35:40):**  It just, we lose the harvest for the next six months.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:35:43):**  So those are some of the challenges.  
**[0:35:46-0:35:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:35:46):**  As people cut down trees, like neighbors cut down trees, well there's less water and less  
**[0:35:50-0:35:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:35:50):**  water and that's why I'm planting more, more trees and more trees.  
**[0:35:54-0:35:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:35:54):**  And so I think those are the biggest challenges.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:35:58):**  Again, I think those are what we're finding with the challenges more and more.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:36:04):**  And you know, neighbors planting with non-organic products and so where you're planting, you  
**[0:36:09-0:36:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:36:09):**  gotta make sure you're not downhill from these people.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:36:12):**  That there's, that your water source is not contaminated and stuff like that.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:36:16):**  But we're in a pretty good spot so I think we're covered from all that, those areas.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:36:21):**  But I think those are the most challenging.  
**[0:36:24-0:36:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:36:24):**  And then at the same time that the community or the government wants to work with you instead  
**[0:36:28-0:36:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:36:28):**  of being a barrier.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:36:30):**  I think those are the, always the biggest challenges as well.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:36:34):**  Sure.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:36:35):**  Now with that in mind, do you have a strategy or an ambition to reach out to larger parts  
**[0:36:40-0:36:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:36:40):**  of the community or even other parts of Guatemala and the surrounding areas to kind of bring  
**[0:36:44-0:36:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:36:44):**  this idea of how someone could reinvigorate a natural forest, especially for the long  
**[0:36:50-0:36:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:36:50):**  term and view it through a different type of profitability lens rather than just as  
**[0:36:55-0:36:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:36:55):**  the value of the lumber itself?  
**[0:36:59-0:37:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:36:59):**  Yeah, I'm trying to work with neighbors who want to work with me.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:37:03):**  Thing is they're on a day to day thing, you know, they're, they don't, they're not on  
**[0:37:07-0:37:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:37:07):**  a three, four, five year vision, you know, they're like, hey, what can I do next month  
**[0:37:13-0:37:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:37:13):**  to make my money?  
**[0:37:14-0:37:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:37:14):**  You know, so it's hard for them to try to sell them something, you know, it's hard for  
**[0:37:17-0:37:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:37:17):**  them to believe that something's going to happen really great if we, you know, two,  
**[0:37:21-0:37:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:37:21):**  three, five years down the line.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:37:24):**  So and I, and sometimes I don't blame them, you know, they need to feed their families,  
**[0:37:28-0:37:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:37:28):**  they need to do stuff they need to, if they don't, they might not be around the next month,  
**[0:37:32-0:37:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:37:32):**  you know, so I understand where they're coming from.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:37:36):**  But I'm trying to work with people and see who does want to work with us.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:37:40):**  And part of it is I'm donating trees to people who want to work with us so they can keep  
**[0:37:45-0:37:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:37:45):**  planting with the native species because they don't have their nurseries.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:37:49):**  And second of all, just reaching out and seeing, you know, the community also as well reaching  
**[0:37:56-0:38:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:37:56):**  out who wants trees and donating them.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:38:01):**  I also developing good ties with them with simple things like just borrowing the weed  
**[0:38:06-0:38:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:38:06):**  whacker to a local church, you know, and, you know, they need some something, you know,  
**[0:38:17-0:38:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:38:17):**  and then just reaching out so they know that they can count on me.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:38:19):**  So when I'm talking to them, it's not, you know, they don't see me as like, oh, it's  
**[0:38:23-0:38:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:38:23):**  bullshit, you know, they're like, hey, this guy really wants to help out and he really  
**[0:38:26-0:38:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:38:26):**  sees this as a potential maybe we should believe them.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:38:30):**  You know, it's a very, very slow long process to gain trust in these areas.  
**[0:38:35-0:38:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:38:35):**  And then I got two or three good guys I'm working with.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:38:39):**  And then I think once they start doing it, I think other people will reach out more and  
**[0:38:44-0:38:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:38:44):**  then they'll see, you know, and I think it can keep growing slowly, but, you know, paving  
**[0:38:49-0:38:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:38:49):**  the path correctly.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:38:52):**  And then, yeah, and then also with schools, I'm starting to develop a program with schools,  
**[0:38:58-0:39:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:38:58):**  not necessarily in the area, but more like schools here in Antigua and where they want  
**[0:39:05-0:39:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:39:05):**  to plant trees, you know, and it was very easy for them to go plant trees.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:39:08):**  But then what I've realized, planting trees is very easy.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:39:12):**  It's that you just go and plant it, you buy a tree, you plant it and boom, there it's  
**[0:39:15-0:39:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:39:15):**  done and you, the kids don't get any attachment to the tree you forget.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:39:19):**  And part of the planting the tree is the three years after you plant it.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:39:23):**  I mean, it's not just, oh, I'm going to go plant the tree and there it is, you know,  
**[0:39:26-0:39:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:39:26):**  one out of 10 will survive if you do that.  
**[0:39:29-0:39:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:39:29):**  So there's a lot of maintenance and care for the tree after you plant it in the mountains.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:39:33):**  So that's something I'm trying to teach them the whole cycle because, and the only way  
**[0:39:38-0:39:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:39:38):**  to do that is to feel an attachment to that tree.  
**[0:39:42-0:39:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:39:42):**  So let's go collect the seeds together with the school.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:39:45):**  Let's go, let's develop a nursery in the school, let each kid really spend six months to a  
**[0:39:50-0:39:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:39:50):**  year with that tree.  
**[0:39:52-0:39:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:39:52):**  So when they go plant it, before they go plant it, there's an attachment there.  
**[0:39:56-0:40:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:39:56):**  It's not just like, oh, I just bought it for 10 for a dollar or $2 and I planted it and  
**[0:40:01-0:40:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:40:01):**  boom, there it is because most of these kids I'm working with probably have the money.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:40:05):**  And so they, and they're, you know, they don't, $2 is nothing for them, but if you teach them  
**[0:40:09-0:40:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:40:09):**  the whole, and then it's a whole year, it's a whole year program in school.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:40:13):**  It's not just go buy and plant and that's in.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:40:15):**  It's there's, you know, you're going to teach them where the seeds are coming from.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:40:19):**  You're going to teach them how to prepare soil, how to develop a nursery, grow their  
**[0:40:23-0:40:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:40:23):**  own tree.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:40:24):**  It's going to be, like I said, eight to 10, eight, eight to 10 months, the whole school  
**[0:40:27-0:40:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:40:27):**  year.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:40:28):**  And then maybe the next year when they're, if they are, you know, maybe the next year,  
**[0:40:32-0:40:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:40:32):**  that's when they go plant it.  
**[0:40:33-0:40:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:40:33):**  And so when they plant it, they're losing someone they've been taking care of for that  
**[0:40:36-0:40:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:40:36):**  long of a period.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:40:37):**  They're not going to just forget about it.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:40:39):**  They're going to want to go check, make sure their tree, at least a majority of them, a  
**[0:40:43-0:40:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:40:43):**  bigger chance are going to go check and make sure their tree is doing well for, until it  
**[0:40:47-0:40:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:40:47):**  survives and thrives.  
**[0:40:49-0:40:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:40:49):**  And I think, you know, if you can make some type of thing like a Facebook or an Instagram  
**[0:40:54-0:40:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:40:54):**  thing where they're proud of it and they're constantly taking pictures and it reminds  
**[0:40:59-0:41:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:40:59):**  them and there's, I think they'll be more, and they'll be more educated.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:41:05):**  Sure.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:41:06):**  No, that's really important.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:41:07):**  It's an often overlooked aspect of reforestation or planting trees in general.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:41:11):**  It's like if you don't make sure that they succeed, and like you said, that three year  
**[0:41:15-0:41:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:41:15):**  period is the most crucial, they tend to be able to be more resilient and be able to thrive  
**[0:41:21-0:41:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:41:21):**  with less maintenance after you cross that three year mark.  
**[0:41:25-0:41:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:41:25):**  But until then, if they're not taken care of, I mean, yeah, this access rate is low  
**[0:41:29-0:41:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:41:29):**  enough that most of the trees that you would plant aren't going to survive.  
**[0:41:33-0:41:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:41:33):**  And it's kind of just an exercise in futility.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:41:36):**  Yeah, it's just more an exercise, you know, and it's like, oh, what are we going to do?  
**[0:41:40-0:41:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:41:40):**  I need to keep these kids interested.  
**[0:41:42-0:41:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:41:42):**  I need to do something different.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:41:43):**  It's kind of like the teacher just, you know, boom, you do something like that.  
**[0:41:47-0:41:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:41:47):**  And yeah, it was a great experience, but it's easily forgotten.  
**[0:41:51-0:41:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:41:51):**  You know, not many trees are going to survive.  
**[0:41:55-0:42:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:41:55):**  And usually what happens is you go to a nursery and you buy 100 trees.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:42:03):**  Within two years, I think it's a much cooler idea to, you know, you come, kids can choose  
**[0:42:09-0:42:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:42:09):**  their different types of species within the forest.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:42:11):**  What do you want to plant this tree?  
**[0:42:13-0:42:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:42:13):**  And maybe they can grab two or three or four or five different types of trees, species,  
**[0:42:18-0:42:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:42:18):**  learn them different, learn about them, you know, what are they good for?  
**[0:42:21-0:42:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:42:21):**  See the different rates of growth.  
**[0:42:23-0:42:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:42:23):**  See this, see that, learn a little bit more.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:42:25):**  And then a year later you got not only one tree to plant, but you got two or three trees  
**[0:42:31-0:42:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:42:31):**  to plant.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:42:32):**  And then there's still, yeah, so I'm not necessarily saying high school.  
**[0:42:37-0:42:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:42:37):**  It could be even earlier, which it should be, but let's say, I'm just, an example would  
**[0:42:41-0:42:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:42:41):**  be high school.  
**[0:42:42-0:42:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:42:42):**  So freshman year you could do the nursery.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:42:46):**  Senior year you're planting your trees.  
**[0:42:48-0:42:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:42:48):**  Junior year you're taking care of the trees planted.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:42:50):**  Senior year you're taking care of the trees you planted.  
**[0:42:52-0:43:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:42:52):**  So you know, there's a 80, 90% success rate with planting trees and you learn the whole  
**[0:43:00-0:43:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:43:00):**  cycle.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:43:02):**  And it was a whole program during school, you know, and I think it's kind of a...  
**[0:43:09-0:43:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:43:09):**  Yeah, I love that.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:43:11):**  It's a wonderful idea.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:43:12):**  Now before we wrap up here, can you give some advice to people who are listening in now?  
**[0:43:17-0:43:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:43:17):**  And actually I'm really interested for myself too, because reforestation is also a very  
**[0:43:22-0:43:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:43:22):**  pressing issue here in Spain as desertification is a major threat to the landscape around  
**[0:43:28-0:43:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:43:28):**  here.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:43:29):**  How have, like we talked a bit about how you've gone through your landscape and observed which  
**[0:43:33-0:43:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:43:33):**  species work there and which you'd want to propagate.  
**[0:43:37-0:43:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:43:37):**  Tell me a little bit about what you've learned about how to propagate different types of  
**[0:43:41-0:43:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:43:41):**  trees and what you've learned in setting up a nursery for maybe uncommon trees or kind  
**[0:43:46-0:43:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:43:46):**  of on an experimental basis for someone who wants to try this themselves.  
**[0:43:51-0:43:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:43:51):**  So the most important is finding the right seed.  
**[0:43:56-0:43:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:43:56):**  You got to harvest it at the right time.  
**[0:43:58-0:44:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:43:58):**  It has to be a good seed.  
**[0:44:00-0:44:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:44:00):**  It all starts out with a good... first spotting the right tree, a good healthy tree and then  
**[0:44:05-0:44:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:44:05):**  getting the right seed and then knowing when that time of the year is and then the second  
**[0:44:12-0:44:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:44:12):**  of all is how to prepare the seed for when you're going to plant it.  
**[0:44:18-0:44:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:44:18):**  Certain seeds need, depending where you're at, they're going to need like a stratification.  
**[0:44:22-0:44:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:44:22):**  They're going to need like a cold season to mitigate winter and then start in spring.  
**[0:44:32-0:44:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:44:32):**  Some seeds can get planted like here in Guatemala.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:44:34):**  You don't need that.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:44:35):**  You can plant right away.  
**[0:44:39-0:44:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:44:39):**  Then some like direct seeded.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:44:41):**  They don't like being put in little plugs or something and some like being put in plugs  
**[0:44:47-0:44:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:44:47):**  because it keeps them warmer and safer.  
**[0:44:51-0:44:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:44:51):**  A lot of it is going to be trial and error unless you got someone who's done it in that  
**[0:44:56-0:45:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:44:56):**  area and can teach you exactly on the species.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:45:00):**  Also rodents, sometimes if you're in an area where there's rodents, if you're planting  
**[0:45:05-0:45:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:45:05):**  acorns, let's say if you're planting acorns and you got squirrels or something, you're  
**[0:45:10-0:45:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:45:10):**  planting a whole bunch of acorns on the ground, you might come back and find that most of  
**[0:45:14-0:45:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:45:14):**  them are cracked open and needed.  
**[0:45:18-0:45:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:45:18):**  You got to be careful with what wildlife is there and what type of seed you're using.  
**[0:45:26-0:45:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:45:26):**  So you need some trees like a lot more water than others.  
**[0:45:33-0:45:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:45:33):**  And then some are more delicate with their root systems.  
**[0:45:37-0:45:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:45:37):**  So you have to be very careful as to when you move them, transplant them to let's say  
**[0:45:42-0:45:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:45:42):**  whatever you're going to use to let them grow for when you can take them to the field.  
**[0:45:48-0:45:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:45:48):**  So those are better to just plant directly on where you can let them grow to the right  
**[0:45:53-0:45:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:45:53):**  size.  
**[0:45:55-0:46:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:45:55):**  So there's a lot of technique behind that and what I would recommend is starting as  
**[0:46:00-0:46:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:46:00):**  soon as possible.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:46:02):**  Get your hands dirty, go do it.  
**[0:46:04-0:46:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:46:04):**  Even if you don't know anything, go experiment, go read, go look at the internet, go do something  
**[0:46:10-0:46:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:46:10):**  and that's the only way you're really going to become an expert at it because anybody  
**[0:46:16-0:46:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:46:16):**  can tell you something.  
**[0:46:18-0:46:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:46:18):**  But those are just guidances to help you through the situation.  
**[0:46:24-0:46:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:46:24):**  At the end, your technique, what you're going to find out, that's the trial and error.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:46:31):**  That's how you're going to really find out what works for you.  
**[0:46:33-0:46:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:46:33):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:34-0:46:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:46:34):**  Now I'm kind of torn between two methods that I've heard of.  
**[0:46:38-0:46:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:46:38):**  There's one where you baby the seeds and the saplings with potting soil mix and compost  
**[0:46:44-0:46:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:46:44):**  and make sure that they get the strongest start possible to try and get the best access  
**[0:46:48-0:46:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:46:48):**  rate from the beginning.  
**[0:46:50-0:46:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:46:50):**  But I also know, especially within the permaculture community, those who just scatter seeds out  
**[0:46:55-0:47:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:46:55):**  in the area or plant a ton very, very close together and really neglect them intentionally  
**[0:47:03-0:47:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:47:03):**  in order to ensure that only the hardiest ones survive and that they continue to propagate  
**[0:47:08-0:47:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:47:08):**  from those sort of hardier genetics from the ones that are able to last without that.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:47:15):**  So they don't give them any special potting mix.  
**[0:47:17-0:47:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:47:17):**  Perhaps they use the exact same soil as you would find on site.  
**[0:47:20-0:47:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:47:20):**  Have you tried one or either of those methods and found some success or some advice?  
**[0:47:26-0:47:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:47:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:27-0:47:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:47:27):**  I mean, that system works very well as well.  
**[0:47:31-0:47:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:47:31):**  You just have to have more seeds.  
**[0:47:34-0:47:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:47:34):**  So either or, just depending on what resources you have, perhaps?  
**[0:47:38-0:47:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:47:38):**  Okay.  
**[0:47:39-0:47:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:47:39):**  So it's good.  
**[0:47:40-0:47:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:47:40):**  It works.  
**[0:47:41-0:47:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:47:41):**  It's just slower and it's not as successful as to develop.  
**[0:47:46-0:47:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:47:46):**  I mean, I like that personally.  
**[0:47:49-0:47:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:47:49):**  It's just you need more time and more seeds than the other way.  
**[0:47:54-0:48:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:47:54):**  I mean, where I'm at, if you were to do that on an area that's clear cut, weeds will grow  
**[0:48:01-0:48:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:48:01):**  so fast that you probably have a one in 50 seeds that you throw might survive.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:48:11):**  So it's maybe even less.  
**[0:48:14-0:48:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:48:14):**  I mean, it's a very, I would say even less than that.  
**[0:48:18-0:48:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:48:18):**  So if you have plenty of seeds in time, I think that would work.  
**[0:48:24-0:48:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:48:24):**  I've done it in certain areas where I don't even go and scatter the seeds.  
**[0:48:29-0:48:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:48:29):**  I just leave the alpha tree and let the same … I spot alpha trees.  
**[0:48:34-0:48:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:48:34):**  I don't.  
**[0:48:35-0:48:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:48:35):**  I leave those there and then let those just naturally drop their seed and have them be  
**[0:48:44-0:48:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:48:44):**  born naturally.  
**[0:48:45-0:48:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:48:45):**  That's really what a natural forest does and that's really the ultimate way of doing  
**[0:48:49-0:48:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:48:49):**  it.  
**[0:48:50-0:48:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:48:50):**  It's just a much slower process.  
**[0:48:55-0:48:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:48:55):**  And it's not just like, oh, those are the toughest.  
**[0:48:57-0:48:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:48:57):**  That's the best way.  
**[0:48:58-0:49:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:48:58):**  I mean, you can implement that.  
**[0:49:03-0:49:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:49:03):**  You choose … that's where you have to be better at selecting when you do the other  
**[0:49:09-0:49:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:49:09):**  process.  
**[0:49:10-0:49:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:49:10):**  What I'm doing is you've got to find what is the right tree, which is the right tree  
**[0:49:13-0:49:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:49:13):**  that's dropping seeds and it's developing the best trees.  
**[0:49:15-0:49:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:49:15):**  So that's the tree.  
**[0:49:16-0:49:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:49:16):**  There might be 10 of that same species in the area, but choose this tree because that  
**[0:49:20-0:49:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:49:20):**  tree is the one that works for me.  
**[0:49:22-0:49:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:49:22):**  That's the healthy one in the area.  
**[0:49:26-0:49:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:49:26):**  Then you plant your seedlings.  
**[0:49:29-0:49:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:49:29):**  You choose the best seed off of that tree.  
**[0:49:31-0:49:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:49:31):**  You might have thousands of seeds from that tree.  
**[0:49:35-0:49:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:49:35):**  You choose the 10 percent you're slowly eating as well.  
**[0:49:42-0:49:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:49:42):**  And then you plant them and then there's still only like an 80 percent success rate  
**[0:49:46-0:49:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:49:46):**  when they germinate, even less maybe.  
**[0:49:49-0:49:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:49:49):**  And then you start selecting as well and then you go plant them.  
**[0:49:53-0:49:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:49:53):**  And I've had very good success as … The problem is you need to make sure you're  
**[0:49:59-0:50:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:49:59):**  collecting plenty of variety of seeds because it's very easy to just do one species that  
**[0:50:04-0:50:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:50:04):**  way.  
**[0:50:07-0:50:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:50:07):**  So the other way, you just collect seeds, throw them all randomly and nature will do  
**[0:50:11-0:50:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:50:11):**  its course kind of.  
**[0:50:14-0:50:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:50:14):**  Ultimately, I think that's the right way of going about things.  
**[0:50:19-0:50:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:50:19):**  I think it's slower and it's not as successful.  
**[0:50:27-0:50:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:50:27):**  It just depends on what your ultimate course is.  
**[0:50:29-0:50:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:50:29):**  Are you trying to reforest really quick, really fast?  
**[0:50:32-0:50:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:50:32):**  Or are you just going about … What I've seen more in permaculture, I practice permaculture,  
**[0:50:37-0:50:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:50:37):**  I practice many other types of organic agriculture systems.  
**[0:50:41-0:50:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:50:41):**  But permaculture, your yields tend to be much better for a family or for a community or  
**[0:50:50-0:50:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:50:50):**  for a set of families who are investing time into that permaculture system.  
**[0:50:56-0:51:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:50:56):**  Unless you start applying other types of systems within your permaculture system like biointensive  
**[0:51:01-0:51:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:51:01):**  systems and certain types of land management systems, it's hard to get very consistent  
**[0:51:09-0:51:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:51:09):**  yields that you can then outsource to other businesses.  
**[0:51:12-0:51:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:51:12):**  You might be able to do in a farmer's market the way I'm talking about.  
**[0:51:15-0:51:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:51:15):**  But if you're trying to find other organisms, you need to really …  
**[0:51:18-0:51:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:51:18):**  You have to dip in efficiency as you get more complex and more diverse.  
**[0:51:22-0:51:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:51:22):**  Exactly.  
**[0:51:23-0:51:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:51:23):**  And therefore, same thing happens with reforestation.  
**[0:51:26-0:51:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:51:26):**  If you have all the time in the world and if you are just doing it and it's easy and  
**[0:51:34-0:51:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:51:34):**  luckily, I am in an area where I have employees, we have people, we're an operating farm.  
**[0:51:43-0:51:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:51:43):**  It's more labor intensive but I feel like it's a much better success rate and it's  
**[0:51:47-0:51:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:51:47):**  a much faster success rate.  
**[0:51:49-0:51:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:51:49):**  And the way I'm doing it, I would pose as what you're saying, that works really well  
**[0:51:55-0:52:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:51:55):**  but I think that would work slower and it's for someone who doesn't have the manpower  
**[0:52:03-0:52:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:52:03):**  behind doing what I'm doing.  
**[0:52:06-0:52:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:52:06):**  It's easier to just grab seeds and go through them.  
**[0:52:08-0:52:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:52:08):**  And even easier, the best way is just leaving nature do its course.  
**[0:52:12-0:52:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:52:12):**  You leave your tree.  
**[0:52:15-0:52:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:52:15):**  When you're in a forest, you need some trees.  
**[0:52:17-0:52:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:52:17):**  You select the ones that are not so good.  
**[0:52:19-0:52:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:52:19):**  You leave the best ones for seed.  
**[0:52:21-0:52:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:52:21):**  Those naturally drop their seeds.  
**[0:52:23-0:52:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:52:23):**  You're not even doing the work and then those reproduce slowly like nature would.  
**[0:52:28-0:52:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:52:28):**  That's really the ultimate goal.  
**[0:52:30-0:52:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:52:30):**  Ideally, yeah.  
**[0:52:31-0:52:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:52:31):**  To have nature do the work for you instead of you throwing out the seeds and you're  
**[0:52:38-0:52:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:52:38):**  doing nature's work throwing the seeds where you want.  
**[0:52:40-0:52:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:52:40):**  If you can get the trees in your area to drop seeds and birds take them there and nature  
**[0:52:45-0:52:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:52:45):**  flies them out there and that's what's being born.  
**[0:52:47-0:52:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:52:47):**  But ultimately nature's telling these are the best plants to be grown here.  
**[0:52:51-0:52:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:52:51):**  But like I said, it's much slower.  
**[0:52:53-0:52:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:52:53):**  It's not as successful.  
**[0:52:57-0:53:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:52:57):**  It's going to take a lot longer to cover land that way, I think, that is going to be available  
**[0:53:02-0:53:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:53:02):**  for a yield sooner.  
**[0:53:05-0:53:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:53:05):**  So if you do that, I'm not going to be able to put tourism into that until 20, 30 years  
**[0:53:10-0:53:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:53:10):**  from now.  
**[0:53:11-0:53:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:53:11):**  It's going to take a while to put something in there that they can really see the difference  
**[0:53:16-0:53:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:53:16):**  between weeds and trees.  
**[0:53:20-0:53:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:53:20):**  And it also does depend on your ecosystem because one of the projects that I went to  
**[0:53:24-0:53:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:53:24):**  go profile and is going to be one of the interviews that I put into this series on reforestation.  
**[0:53:30-0:53:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:53:30):**  They're in a cloud forest environment in Veracruz, Mexico.  
**[0:53:34-0:53:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:53:34):**  And they bought a pasture land that of course was part of the cloud forest originally was  
**[0:53:40-0:53:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:53:40):**  completely clear cut and left to pasture cattle for a long time.  
**[0:53:45-0:53:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:53:45):**  And as soon as they bought it, they took all the cattle off and allowed it to regenerate  
**[0:53:48-0:53:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:53:48):**  on its own.  
**[0:53:49-0:53:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:53:49):**  And within 15 years, it's become a forest completely without any maintenance.  
**[0:53:54-0:53:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:53:54):**  Now that's not going to happen everywhere in the world.  
**[0:53:57-0:54:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:53:57):**  That's a very unique ecosystem that wants to be under forest so desperately has the  
**[0:54:01-0:54:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:54:01):**  water resources and everything to allow for that to happen.  
**[0:54:05-0:54:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:54:05):**  But there are some circumstances where I have seen where leaving it fallow is actually one  
**[0:54:11-0:54:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:54:11):**  of the most accelerating ways to regenerate.  
**[0:54:13-0:54:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:54:13):**  But it does require very unique circumstances.  
**[0:54:16-0:54:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:54:16):**  Yeah, I guess it depends on the type of weeds that are growing in that area.  
**[0:54:23-0:54:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:54:23):**  Here where we're at, there's a lot of choker weeds, weeds that like are parasitic weeds.  
**[0:54:32-0:54:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:54:32):**  And therefore here, if something is, they'll just start crawling all over it and choking  
**[0:54:37-0:54:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:54:37):**  it to death and letting it not letting it grow.  
**[0:54:40-0:54:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:54:40):**  So you got to make sure, you know, doesn't mean it's just a success rate would be a lot  
**[0:54:45-0:54:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:54:45):**  and it works.  
**[0:54:46-0:54:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:54:46):**  It's just a lot slower.  
**[0:54:47-0:54:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:54:47):**  I think I can have a forest doing the way I'm doing and within five years, you'll have  
**[0:54:52-0:55:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:54:52):**  something that are, you know, 20, 25 feet tall trees within five, six years.  
**[0:55:00-0:55:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:55:00):**  So it's half the time at 15 years and being that area being the right perfect space.  
**[0:55:07-0:55:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:55:07):**  So I think it just depends on the area, what you're planning to do with it.  
**[0:55:16-0:55:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:55:16):**  I'm very fond of just leaving nature do its thing.  
**[0:55:19-0:55:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:55:19):**  I have areas within my farm where I'm just not touching and I'm just, you know, I'm playing  
**[0:55:24-0:55:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:55:24):**  around with it and I'm just letting it go wild.  
**[0:55:26-0:55:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:55:26):**  And you know, right now there's all these, it's just all, the weeds where I'm at, they  
**[0:55:33-0:55:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:55:33):**  grow 20, 15 feet tall, the weeds where I'm at.  
**[0:55:36-0:55:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:55:36):**  And so they're huge, you know, these weeds and then eventually they start dying out and  
**[0:55:41-0:55:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:55:41):**  they weeds could cover weeds and then that's when the trees start evolving.  
**[0:55:45-0:55:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:55:45):**  So the successive models of the forest naturally.  
**[0:55:49-0:55:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:55:49):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:55:50-0:55:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:55:50):**  It takes two to three years before even a tree might sprout and then it takes, you know,  
**[0:55:54-0:55:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:55:54):**  it just, it's, it's, it's, and it works great.  
**[0:55:56-0:56:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:55:56):**  It's just the areas they just, if they're very isolated and they're very hard to plant  
**[0:56:01-0:56:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:56:01):**  trees on them, those are probably the best areas to do.  
**[0:56:04-0:56:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:56:04):**  If it's something that's within, you know, your, your, if you're trying to plant trees  
**[0:56:08-0:56:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:56:08):**  within the third and fourth area of your permaculture project, let's say, I would say those are  
**[0:56:13-0:56:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:56:13):**  actually easier to do what I'm doing and your fifth and if you, if you have a sixth area,  
**[0:56:18-0:56:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:56:18):**  let's say, well maybe those are the areas you just want to let nature do its course.  
**[0:56:22-0:56:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:56:22):**  Sure.  
**[0:56:23-0:56:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:56:23):**  You know, they're just too far out there getting the trees out there, moving out to those areas,  
**[0:56:27-0:56:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:56:27):**  trying to take care of that, that situation.  
**[0:56:30-0:56:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:56:30):**  It's very labor intensive.  
**[0:56:31-0:56:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:56:31):**  It's too, it's, it's, it's complicated.  
**[0:56:33-0:56:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:56:33):**  Yeah.  
**[0:56:34-0:56:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:56:34):**  I love that you start talking about the broad acreage that you're working on when you start  
**[0:56:37-0:56:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:56:37):**  getting into the...  
**[0:56:38-0:56:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:56:38):**  Exactly.  
**[0:56:39-0:56:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:56:39):**  So there's a lot of areas in my farm where I'm just, they're just very hard access and  
**[0:56:43-0:56:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:56:43):**  those I'm just leaving them go wild and those are the areas, anything that's very close  
**[0:56:46-0:56:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:56:46):**  or I want to see them to be walking through where I did, there, it's a very nice view  
**[0:56:54-0:56:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:56:54):**  and those are the areas I'm more planting quick.  
**[0:56:56-0:56:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:56:56):**  I want that to really come out as fast as possible.  
**[0:56:59-0:57:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:56:59):**  And then after three years, four years, my trees are, like I said, my trees within three  
**[0:57:04-0:57:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:57:04):**  to four years, I planted some trees two years ago, they're already 10 feet tall, two years  
**[0:57:08-0:57:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:57:08):**  ago.  
**[0:57:09-0:57:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:57:09):**  Not all of them, but some of them are 10 feet tall, two years.  
**[0:57:12-0:57:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:57:12):**  So one year of making the tree, right?  
**[0:57:14-0:57:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:57:14):**  One make of making the tree.  
**[0:57:15-0:57:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:57:15):**  So the tree, when I put it on the ground, it's about two feet tall, one, you know, by  
**[0:57:19-0:57:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:57:19):**  the time, then two years later, it's, it's, it's over 10 feet.  
**[0:57:22-0:57:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:57:22):**  It's already starting to look nice within three years, within two years since I put  
**[0:57:25-0:57:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:57:25):**  it on the ground.  
**[0:57:26-0:57:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:57:26):**  It's already, it's, it, it looks, it looks like there's something there and then I might  
**[0:57:29-0:57:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:57:29):**  just take care of it for another year or so.  
**[0:57:32-0:57:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:57:32):**  And then I just let natural weeds grow, but the trees alone are going to create shade  
**[0:57:37-0:57:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:57:37):**  and then, so they're not going to let all the bottom grow too crazy anymore.  
**[0:57:40-0:57:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:57:40):**  They're going to control it.  
**[0:57:41-0:57:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:57:41):**  They're going to be dropping their leaves.  
**[0:57:42-0:57:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:57:42):**  They're going to start developing mulch a lot faster too.  
**[0:57:46-0:57:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:57:46):**  I use mulch from my forest as fertilizer as well.  
**[0:57:49-0:57:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:57:49):**  So if I depend on that mulch, how fast can I get that mulch production going?  
**[0:57:54-0:58:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:57:54):**  I use a tree mulch forest, which then I compost with animal products and, and, and all sorts  
**[0:58:01-0:58:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:58:01):**  of stuff, whatever I can get my access to.  
**[0:58:03-0:58:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:58:03):**  And that's a very important part of my fertilization is using a tree, tree scraps from below.  
**[0:58:09-0:58:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:58:09):**  Basically how soon can I produce that?  
**[0:58:11-0:58:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:58:11):**  Yeah.  
**[0:58:12-0:58:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:58:12):**  Yeah.  
**[0:58:13-0:58:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:58:13):**  How soon can you start to get the yield from the forest products like that so that it starts  
**[0:58:17-0:58:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:58:17):**  to maintain itself is what you're getting at?  
**[0:58:19-0:58:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:58:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:58:20-0:58:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:58:20):**  It's like a by-product.  
**[0:58:21-0:58:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:58:21):**  And then I use that to compost, you know, with my animal manures and stuff and, and  
**[0:58:27-0:58:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:58:27):**  I can create fertilizer for the, for the, for the veggies, for the avocados, for the  
**[0:58:32-0:58:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:58:32):**  fruit trees, for stuff like that.  
**[0:58:34-0:58:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:58:34):**  So I mean, there's another, another thing behind that as well.  
**[0:58:38-0:58:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:58:38):**  So, but like your trees that I planted three years ago, you know, I don't have to take  
**[0:58:43-0:58:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:58:43):**  care of that area anymore.  
**[0:58:45-0:58:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:58:45):**  But you know, if I would have left it without doing this, like you're saying, trees would  
**[0:58:51-0:58:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:58:51):**  just be starting to sprout right now after a year.  
**[0:58:54-0:58:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:58:54):**  Gotcha.  
**[0:58:55-0:58:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:58:55):**  And yeah, that's good to know.  
**[0:58:57-0:59:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:58:57):**  It's those types of practical answers that I love getting from people who are boots on  
**[0:59:01-0:59:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:59:01):**  the ground, really doing this stuff themselves because in different cases and with different  
**[0:59:07-0:59:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:59:07):**  criteria or different goals, different approaches work or fail depending on, like you said,  
**[0:59:14-0:59:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:59:14):**  the amount of people that you have able to work on this and the goals of the project  
**[0:59:19-0:59:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:59:19):**  itself, it changes the context and it's very good to hear what you found through your own  
**[0:59:25-0:59:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:59:25):**  practical experience.  
**[0:59:26-0:59:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:59:26):**  Now with that in mind, can you tell our listeners how they can either get in touch with you  
**[0:59:31-0:59:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:59:31):**  to learn more or find out more about the projects in general and get in touch?  
**[0:59:37-0:59:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:59:37):**  Yeah, well you can find us on Facebook at Coba Farms or Instagram Coba Farms.  
**[0:59:44-0:59:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:59:44):**  We got a pretty decent response rate there.  
**[0:59:46-0:59:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:59:46):**  So if you want to contact us that way or our website, www.cobafarms.com.  
**[0:59:52-0:59:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:59:52):**  And you can ask for Alex, that's me, and then we can start chatting together and if it's  
**[0:59:59-1:00:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:59:59):**  something interesting, we'll keep talking.  
**[1:00:03-1:00:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=1:00:03):**  I think that's the best way.

**[1:00:21-1:00:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=1:00:21):**  kind of intensely managed permaculture inspired but also very pragmatic way of growing a lot  
**[1:00:28-1:00:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=1:00:28):**  of diversity and a lot of rentalia, like profitable crops, as well as all of the things that you  
**[1:00:35-1:00:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=1:00:35):**  have set up there for families, for events.  
**[1:00:39-1:00:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=1:00:39):**  It's an incredibly inspiring place to see.

**[0:07:09-0:07:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:07:09):**  NGOs to the declaration of global peasants rights, which resolved in December of 2018  
**[0:07:14-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:07:14):**  in the General Assembly of the United Nations of New York.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:07:18):**  Okay, well, as you can see, we have some excellent speakers with us tonight.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:07:22):**  And I would like to start off this conversation focusing on building community in agriculture  
**[0:07:29-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:07:29):**  with the question that what are some of the first steps in facilitating and organizing  
**[0:07:35-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:07:35):**  groups towards greater cooperation?  
**[0:07:38-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:07:38):**  Perhaps Rudolf, you could start us off.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:07:40):**  Yeah, thank you.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:07:42):**  That's a good question, I have to say.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:07:47):**  And of course, I would say, farmers all over the world are quite the same, you know, is,  
**[0:07:58-0:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:07:58):**  let's say, in a cultural approach and social approach.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:08:03):**  I have learned during my international time that was in the 70s and 80s.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:08:12):**  And to lift even in Zambia, I was two and a half years in Zambia, Alan, and close to  
**[0:08:21-0:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:08:21):**  Mazabuka area.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:08:24):**  And then also in, in Syria and Arab countries and East India, Bangladesh, so I have to say,  
**[0:08:34-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:08:34):**  farmers can, let's say easily being motivated, you know, for new challenges and new developments.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:08:42):**  But it is also part of your question.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:08:47):**  And this is, I would say, this is the main obstacle or the main thing that we get them  
**[0:08:55-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:08:55):**  organized on a sustainable manner, you know, and on a long term.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:09:01):**  And well, this is the process, which is influenced by a lot of, I would say, circumstances.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:09:11):**  Of course, first of all, I would say, farmers recognize almost best one of themselves as  
**[0:09:21-0:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:09:21):**  a leader, you know, less than outside persons, rather they are experts or whatever they prefer,  
**[0:09:32-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:09:32):**  or let's say they have more trust and confidence to people who are, you know, socialized among  
**[0:09:40-0:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:09:40):**  themselves and know their culture and their culture and so on.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:09:45):**  I think this is one important issue.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:09:47):**  And secondly is, if it comes from the idea into institutionalization, I would say, that  
**[0:09:59-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:09:59):**  it should be a suitable framework, which fits actually to several points, you know, it has  
**[0:10:09-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:10:09):**  first of all, I believe, we have to set up and to focus always on democratic principles  
**[0:10:19-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:10:19):**  that that means one member, one mode, one vote is very important.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:10:26):**  One equal rights, you know, that each farmer rather is a small or a large scale farmer  
**[0:10:34-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:10:34):**  have the same rights, and that's very important.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:10:40):**  And then we need a legal framework, actually, what I mentioned, rather cooperative or any  
**[0:10:47-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:10:47):**  other association or what else, which fits to the prevailing situation and also to the  
**[0:10:55-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:10:55):**  products which need to be sourced and sailed on get into sale.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:11:05):**  So these are some basic issues.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:11:09):**  And let's say after a few years of trial and error, it should lead into a stabilized group  
**[0:11:20-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:11:20):**  and structure and at the end, farmers have to benefit out of it, you know, and then it  
**[0:11:28-0:11:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:11:28):**  is a sustainable enterprise, you know, they have to benefit out of it.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:11:34):**  Because, you know, enthusiasm is quite nice and a few years it carries on but on the long  
**[0:11:44-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:11:44):**  term and I would say farmers association of Schwebischal, which I founded here in my home  
**[0:11:52-0:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:11:52):**  region 88.  
**[0:11:55-0:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:11:55):**  So it's 33 years now ago, and with eight farmers, farming families, you mentioned that we have  
**[0:12:02-0:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:12:02):**  1560 now.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:12:06):**  This is a long go, I would say and finally, and the end, we look on our farmers, actually,  
**[0:12:17-0:12:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:12:17):**  I'm the chairman since since the beginning, and I am not a manager, I'm just the elected  
**[0:12:24-0:12:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:12:24):**  chairman, that is very important.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:12:28):**  And I would say the case is in that our farmers have the right to access markets, so they  
**[0:12:41-0:12:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:12:41):**  have a guarantee that we purchase all their products, they have a guarantee on prices.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:12:49):**  And on the other hand, they have to follow the standards and to accept the control measures.  
**[0:12:54-0:13:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:12:54):**  So this is the, let's say, bow-size commitment.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:13:00):**  Let's say the standards are organic, in most of the cases, 800 are certified organic and  
**[0:13:10-0:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:13:10):**  others are to our private standards.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:13:13):**  And this is the bow-size commitment.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:13:15):**  And so our farmers are benefiting very well out of the scheme.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:13:21):**  And so that's, I think, is the goal towards sustainability, you know, to stay stable.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:13:29):**  Yeah, that's fantastic.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:13:31):**  You hit on a lot of really important things there that are fundamental to having these  
**[0:13:36-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:13:36):**  organizations work.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:13:37):**  I'm wondering, Alan, do you have some other insights on how to get these types of conversations  
**[0:13:42-0:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:13:42):**  started and where you like to begin in your experience facilitating and organizing groups  
**[0:13:47-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:13:47):**  towards greater cooperation?  
**[0:13:49-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:13:49):**  Well, when you, I was sort of dreading this, when you say, you know, with my experience,  
**[0:13:59-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:13:59):**  I know a hell of a lot of things not to do.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:14:02):**  I don't know many things what to do.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:14:06):**  We're dealing with something very complex here.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:14:10):**  Rudolph is absolutely right, you know, the local leadership, etc.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:14:15):**  And that is why the Savory Institute with its more than 50 hubs now around the world,  
**[0:14:21-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:14:21):**  they are all locally led, locally managed, so that the management is entirely in that  
**[0:14:27-0:14:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:14:27):**  language, that culture, local expertise, everything, and works to a local holistic context.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:14:36):**  So on that point, I think there's complete agreement.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:14:42):**  When we say, Rudolph says democratic, I put it, wrote that and I put a question mark.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:14:47):**  And I thought, well, does that make any difference?  
**[0:14:52-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:14:52):**  Because whether dictatorships or democracies, it doesn't make any difference.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:14:57):**  The end result is the same, because they both make decisions exactly the same way.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:15:02):**  And the cause of the problem over 1000s of years, through all types of governments and  
**[0:15:08-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:15:08):**  organization has been consistently the same.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:15:13):**  Humans damage their environment, their economy, and civilizations collapse.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:15:17):**  Now we're facing it globally.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:15:19):**  And so whether dictatorship or democracy doesn't seem to make a difference.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:15:25):**  And then, but what do we mean in democracy?  
**[0:15:27-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:15:27):**  Well, we're really wanting diverse views, not one person's view.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:15:32):**  And we're all saying we need to mimic nature.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:15:34):**  That's coming out more and more.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:15:36):**  People are seeing that.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:15:38):**  And that's true.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:15:40):**  And when we look at nature, diversity is fundamental in the environment, in the synergy, in biological  
**[0:15:48-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:15:48):**  communities.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:15:50):**  When we look at economies that we're managing, diversity of economy, again, is an essential  
**[0:15:55-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:15:55):**  principle.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:15:57):**  Then when we look to human society, diversity of views, we find the opposite.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:16:02):**  We find the total chaos of centuries, and of 26 COP meetings now, with the world's experts

**[0:19:36-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:19:36):**  the wicked problems in complex human organisations, we might find a way to solve this.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:19:45):**  Now, so that's not just a lot of words for everybody.

**[0:19:58-0:20:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:19:58):**  The founders of our great religions had a very simple message, love and caring.

**[0:24:00-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:24:00):**  That's a paradox.

**[0:24:03-0:24:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:24:03):**  Yeah.

**[0:24:06-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:24:06):**  Well, this is brilliant.

**[0:24:10-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:24:10):**  I love it.

**[0:24:13-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:24:13):**  What are some of the first steps in facilitating and organizing groups towards greater cooperation?  
**[0:24:18-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:24:18):**  Wow.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:24:19):**  Well, first of all, thank you for the opportunity to be here today.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:24:23):**  And thank you to Rudolph and Alan for everything you've just said, because it's so rich and  
**[0:24:28-0:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:24:28):**  full of message and of experience.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:24:33):**  And the idea you were saying, Alan, about unity, the unity that we need as a species  
**[0:24:40-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:24:40):**  and as a living reality on this planet, with this planet, no?  
**[0:24:45-0:24:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:24:45):**  We need that unity.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:24:47):**  And it's such a massive challenge.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:24:50):**  How do we bring people together?  
**[0:24:53-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:24:53):**  And those common aims that can come from common challenges are something that are right now  
**[0:25:00-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:25:00):**  an opportunity to bring us together.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:25:03):**  And in my experience, it requires generous cooperation on the part of everyone.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:25:13):**  And for that, I really feel that, and I live this as well, is what I've been seeing, is  
**[0:25:20-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:25:20):**  that it requires a profound inner transformation in people.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:25:26):**  Because if we continue to come from the paradigm that we have been educating it into, about  
**[0:25:33-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:25:33):**  competing for resources and competing to be the best one and the first one to get there  
**[0:25:37-0:25:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:25:37):**  and the one that does the most and the one that earns the most, that's the old paradigm.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:25:44):**  And the new paradigm has to be about sharing and cooperation.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:25:50):**  So we need to retrain ourselves into that.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:25:53):**  We were, all of us here, born into a society that was promoting competition.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:25:58):**  And so we need to re-educate ourselves into cooperation, and that requires profound inner  
**[0:26:05-0:26:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:26:05):**  change.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:26:06):**  So for me, that's a key element in the shift in paradigm.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:26:12):**  And from my own personal experience, is where I can share from, I was very lucky that in  
**[0:26:19-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:26:19):**  2007, I was hired to interpret Darren Dougherty when he first started coming to Spain to train  
**[0:26:25-0:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:26:25):**  in regenerative agriculture, which at the time wasn't even coined in that way, but that's  
**[0:26:30-0:26:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:26:30):**  what it was.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:26:31):**  It was permaculture for professionals, basically.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:26:35):**  And so that, for the people who came to the courses, it was like an absolute eye-opener.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:26:41):**  It was just an absolute shift within them.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:26:44):**  And then they would go home and go, oh, well, where do I start?  
**[0:26:47-0:26:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:26:47):**  How do I apply this?  
**[0:26:50-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:26:50):**  No one around me understands what I'm talking about.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:26:53):**  It's difficult to convey.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:26:56):**  I'm the crazy person around here, and I don't even know where to start, really.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:27:00):**  So after a few years of these kinds of trainings, I realized, well, we need a network of people.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:27:07):**  People need to be supported.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:27:08):**  They cannot go home and be on their own.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:27:11):**  And so I was very fortunate as well that at the same time as I came across, as regenerative  
**[0:27:18-0:27:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:27:18):**  agriculture took me over, I was also interpreting for people who are leaders in the world of  
**[0:27:25-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:27:25):**  facilitation and, let's say, group organization in a work.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:27:32):**  And we could call it deep ecology.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:27:35):**  And so it just went click.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:27:38):**  It was like, OK, we need to change the way we relate to the soil and the land and how  
**[0:27:42-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:27:42):**  we grow food.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:27:43):**  But we also need to change the way we relate to ourselves, first of all.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:27:48):**  The inner dialogue that I have with myself, what am I telling myself?  
**[0:27:53-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:27:53):**  How am I relating to others?  
**[0:27:55-0:27:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:27:55):**  How do I enter a group?  
**[0:27:57-0:27:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:27:57):**  What energy do I bring in?  
**[0:27:59-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:27:59):**  What expectations do I bring in?  
**[0:28:01-0:28:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:28:01):**  What abilities am I offering?  
**[0:28:03-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:28:03):**  What am I expecting to get back?  
**[0:28:06-0:28:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:28:06):**  And all of this, for me, it was like, OK, we need to bring those two things together.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:28:11):**  If there's going to be a paradigm shift, it has to be inner, collective, and then come  
**[0:28:17-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:28:17):**  the methodologies and the practices.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:28:21):**  And so in the courses that over the next time, firstly, when you were saying, what are the  
**[0:28:27-0:28:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:28:27):**  steps that we can take?  
**[0:28:29-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:28:29):**  For me, initially, back in those days when there was no material about all of this in  
**[0:28:34-0:28:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:28:34):**  Spanish or practically none, I started giving talks based on Darren's material, translating  
**[0:28:41-0:28:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:28:41):**  that, and giving talks to anyone who would listen.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:28:44):**  A council, a group of neighbors, a group of farmers, a scientific institution, whatever.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:28:51):**  I just gave talks everywhere and started collecting names and contacts of people who are interested  
**[0:28:57-0:29:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:28:57):**  in this topic in regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:29:01):**  And once I had enough names and enough interest with Darren, we agreed on bringing some experts  
**[0:29:09-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:29:09):**  to Spain.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:29:10):**  And some of those first experts, one of them was Kurt Gatzia with his wonderful wife Tamara.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:29:17):**  And we brought Joel Salatin, also Latin American experts like Jairo Restrepo, Nacho Simon.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:29:27):**  Later on, we worked with Professor Binedo Matado.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:29:30):**  So we were bringing these expert voices in because often, to get something kickstarted,  
**[0:29:38-0:29:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:29:38):**  you kind of need a champion.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:29:40):**  You need a leader.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:29:41):**  Someone who's got the information can communicate it and move people.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:29:45):**  And at the same time, at those events, which were a few days long, I always made sure that  
**[0:29:51-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:29:51):**  we had spaces and tools to allow people to connect with each other at another level.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:30:00):**  And I remember one guy who used to come to everything, although he was retired, he came  
**[0:30:04-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:30:04):**  to every event because he said, I really love these events because people leave their medals  
**[0:30:09-0:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:30:09):**  at the door.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:30:12):**  We created a space and an ambiance that allowed people to just be themselves.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:30:18):**  Because sometimes, if someone says, hi, I'm John and I'm unemployed, people get an idea  
**[0:30:23-0:30:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:30:23):**  in the head of that person.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:30:25):**  But if you connect from a different space and speak from the heart and listen openly,  
**[0:30:31-0:30:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:30:31):**  respectfully, and create those spaces, then people start to communicate in a different  
**[0:30:35-0:30:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:30:35):**  way.

**[0:30:40-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:30:40):**  really shy and not that prone to speaking in public.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:30:45):**  And so you have to create, it's very useful to create these spaces where people are given  
**[0:30:51-0:30:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:30:51):**  the voice and are asked to speak and participate, circles, different activities that allow everyone  
**[0:30:57-0:31:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:30:57):**  to have a voice and everyone to be heard.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:31:00):**  And this creates an atmosphere.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:31:02):**  It can be done really simply, but it creates an atmosphere where people can really connect.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:31:06):**  And so those connections then continue over time.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:31:13):**  It's completely different if you call someone, a farmer that you know and ask them for something  
**[0:31:19-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:31:19):**  or ask a question, if you don't know them or if you met them in a kind of impersonal  
**[0:31:26-0:31:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:31:26):**  way.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:31:27):**  It's completely different if you met them in a way where you connected more deeply.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:31:31):**  And so there's a connection there that stays over time.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:31:35):**  And so when that call comes, it's welcome.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:31:38):**  It's, oh, it's a friend calling.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:31:40):**  So that was something that we really worked on, like very consciously creating those spaces  
**[0:31:47-0:31:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:31:47):**  and those tools.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:31:49):**  And then after some time, we realized we needed to have some kind of institution, organization,  
**[0:31:57-0:32:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:31:57):**  because you need to be legally present so that you can go and ask for a council for  
**[0:32:04-0:32:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:32:04):**  a space or ask for any kind of official thing.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:32:08):**  You need to be an official body.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:32:09):**  You can't just be a person.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:32:11):**  So we created the association in 2013, the Association of Regenerative Agriculture in  
**[0:32:17-0:32:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:32:17):**  Spain.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:32:18):**  But it's a very small organization that is purely a tool.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:32:24):**  It's a legal and administrative and banking tool that allows us to do stuff.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:32:32):**  But I feel that the movement in Spain is not the association.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:32:36):**  That's just a tool.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:32:38):**  The movement is the collective.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:32:40):**  And it's all those human connections that have been made.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:32:44):**  And all of those connections lead on to many other things and many other groups springing  
**[0:32:49-0:32:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:32:49):**  up and all of these wonderful human experiences.  
**[0:32:56-0:33:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:32:56):**  And this is something that over the last couple of years has almost been robbed of us, is  
**[0:33:03-0:33:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:33:03):**  these human experiences of meeting together and sharing in presence.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:33:08):**  And that's something we need to recover.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:33:10):**  And we need to lose the fear to come together and connect from a human level, because those  
**[0:33:17-0:33:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:33:17):**  connections are really, really strong and will take us a long way.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:33:21):**  And they build respect.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:33:23):**  And they build love and care for each other, as Alan was saying.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:33:28):**  And then the next stage for me, and I'll run through this quickly, is about those people  
**[0:33:34-0:33:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:33:34):**  who were receiving the first trainings.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:33:39):**  In the first years, it was about training stakeholders, training agents of change.  
**[0:33:43-0:33:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:33:43):**  And in the beginning, just a couple of the people in each course would be a farmer, a  
**[0:33:47-0:33:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:33:47):**  professional farmer.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:33:49):**  Over the years, we're seeing how those trainings, more and more farmers are joining.  
**[0:33:55-0:34:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:33:55):**  And in the last trainings I've been involved in co-organizing, most of them are farmers.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:34:00):**  So there's that momentum amongst professional farmers where conventional farming doesn't  
**[0:34:06-0:34:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:34:06):**  work and organic registered farming is better, definitely, but still doesn't respond to a  
**[0:34:14-0:34:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:34:14):**  whole bunch of needs and realities.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:34:16):**  And so we need to go further.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:34:18):**  And for me, that's the regenerative vision and the regenerative practice is going further,  
**[0:34:22-0:34:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:34:22):**  way beyond.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:34:24):**  And so it was about adapting.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:34:27):**  We then had to, we've gone through a process, the farmers have gone through a process of  
**[0:34:30-0:34:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:34:30):**  adaptation of those amazing ideas and concepts that those international trainers were bringing  
**[0:34:36-0:34:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:34:36):**  to us, but then they need to be adapted locally.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:34:40):**  Every country is different.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:34:41):**  The legality is different.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:34:42):**  The soils are different.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:34:43):**  The tradition, the customs, the culture, as Alan and Rudolf were both saying, it's like  
**[0:34:48-0:34:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:34:48):**  it has to be culturally and locally appropriate.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:34:51):**  So it's in the hands of the local farmers to adapt those tools and methodologies to  
**[0:34:55-0:34:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:34:55):**  their reality.  
**[0:34:57-0:35:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:34:57):**  And now, after a few years, we're at a stage where there's a whole set, a whole network  
**[0:35:03-0:35:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:35:03):**  of active regenerative farmers in Spain that are pioneers, they were very brave in the  
**[0:35:08-0:35:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:35:08):**  beginning.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:35:11):**  They had the courage and they had also the friendships and support.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:35:16):**  And they now have farms that can be visited, can be seen.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:35:22):**  We try from the Association and other groups, we try to help them organize those visits.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:35:28):**  So it's not a trickle of people visiting, but they're actually, you know, again, bringing  
**[0:35:32-0:35:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:35:32):**  people together to visit a farm in an organized way, in a way that's compensating the farmer  
**[0:35:38-0:35:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:35:38):**  as well.  
**[0:35:39-0:35:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:35:39):**  It's a wonderful way as well to motivate the farmers.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:35:42):**  And as Rudolf was saying, it's a farmer to farmer conversations that are the most enriching  
**[0:35:48-0:35:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:35:48):**  and fertile.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:35:49):**  So that's what we need to really, really promote.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:35:52):**  So if people are thinking, well, how can I get this going in my region?  
**[0:35:56-0:36:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:35:56):**  First of all, I'd say start talking about it and start organizing small events, gatherings.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:36:01):**  There's so much material now, wonderful documentaries and films that you can use to show a film  
**[0:36:06-0:36:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:36:06):**  and then have a conversation about it.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:36:07):**  You know, and start with that.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:36:09):**  Connect with your local farmers and be patient because it is a lot of work and it involves  
**[0:36:17-0:36:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:36:17):**  a lot of presence as well.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:36:18):**  So I'll leave it at that for now.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:36:21):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:36:22):**  Look, we've now covered on some really core and fundamental things to kind of launch the  
**[0:36:27-0:36:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:36:27):**  rest of this conversation on with.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:36:29):**  Rudolf, I want to come back to you and something important that you were saying towards the  
**[0:36:33-0:36:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:36:33):**  end of your original statement, which is that it can be difficult to continue with the initial  
**[0:36:39-0:36:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:36:39):**  motivations and energy when you're getting a community together.  
**[0:36:44-0:36:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:36:44):**  And many of them make a large initial leap as they first become united based on that  
**[0:36:50-0:36:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:36:50):**  early excitement.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:36:51):**  But how have you found to maintain that momentum in the long term and keep people active and  
**[0:36:57-0:36:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:36:57):**  engaged?  
**[0:36:59-0:37:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:36:59):**  Well, this is, you know, this is, I would say, a subject you should know, you know,

**[0:37:37-0:37:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:37:37):**  Always rather in the south, same in the north, farmers are the losers in industrial environments,

**[0:38:24-0:38:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:38:24):**  the fair share on their products, the fair share along the value chain.  
**[0:38:31-0:38:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:38:31):**  You know, you should recognize the richest Germans are the food dealers and the poor

**[0:38:48-0:38:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:38:48):**  over the world, the same farmers are the losers.

**[0:38:57-0:39:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:38:57):**  But in the long term, we have to work on these issues that farmers get a fair share for their  
**[0:39:06-0:39:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:39:06):**  products.

**[0:39:31-0:39:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:39:31):**  And this is actually my personal struggle since long time that we find solutions for  
**[0:39:42-0:39:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:39:42):**  farmers, I call it solidarity business, you know, farmers to join, to take to take it  
**[0:39:50-0:39:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:39:50):**  in their own hands, develop business models which fit to the farmers communities, and  
**[0:39:59-0:40:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:39:59):**  at the end that they can have a fair income.

**[0:40:11-0:40:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:40:11):**  And fortunately, all the farmers, which I'm representing, rather here in our region, or  
**[0:40:21-0:40:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:40:21):**  let's say, Kerala, India, I have to say, we assist them in getting into organic scheme  
**[0:40:31-0:40:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:40:31):**  or even regenerative agriculture schemes.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:40:37):**  And then we offer them the double price than before, through to direct trade through to  
**[0:40:45-0:40:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:40:45):**  solitary business.

**[0:40:55-0:40:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:40:55):**  future.

**[0:41:05-0:41:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:41:05):**  and farmer families future.

**[0:41:27-0:41:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:41:27):**  in so many different places around the world and how that's developed?  
**[0:41:31-0:41:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:41:31):**  Well, again, I dread this because I, as I keep telling you, I know so many things that  
**[0:41:38-0:41:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:41:38):**  don't work.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:41:39):**  I know that for 65 years of my adult life, since I began studying what we've now learned  
**[0:41:47-0:41:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:41:47):**  is the basic cause of the problem to now I've seen so many things that we're talking about  
**[0:41:53-0:41:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:41:53):**  that I cannot disagree with.  
**[0:41:55-0:42:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:41:55):**  I agree with them completely with what Rudolph's saying, what Anna's saying.  
**[0:42:00-0:42:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:42:00):**  But the point is, and I think they both made it, is that you need patience.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:42:06):**  Anna was saying, you know, from 2007, when she started working with some of the people  
**[0:42:12-0:42:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:42:12):**  in region, well, that's 14 years ago.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:42:15):**  What percentage of the population, even in your Iberian area, did you represent then?  
**[0:42:22-0:42:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:42:22):**  And how many do you represent now?  
**[0:42:24-0:42:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:42:24):**  You see, it's almost none.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:42:26):**  That's why that approach, we know from history and science and published papers, that will  
**[0:42:33-0:42:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:42:33):**  take 200 to 300 years till it becomes policy.  
**[0:42:38-0:42:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:42:38):**  Okay, with which we manage by scale.  
**[0:42:41-0:42:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:42:41):**  I don't think young people have got that time.  
**[0:42:44-0:42:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:42:44):**  Right now, when, and Anna said, you need to shift the view, and then the methodology.  
**[0:42:51-0:42:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:42:51):**  I've come to the conclusion, after 65 years of trying to first understand, then find a  
**[0:42:58-0:43:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:42:58):**  way to solve the problem.  
**[0:43:00-0:43:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:43:00):**  And then to shift the view, I've come to understand that actually, if you do it the other way  
**[0:43:05-0:43:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:43:05):**  around, it's far quicker.  
**[0:43:07-0:43:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:43:07):**  If you shift the methodology, the view just follows.  
**[0:43:10-0:43:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:43:10):**  Once you address the cause of the problem.  
**[0:43:13-0:43:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:43:13):**  And so everything we're discussing, and I'm not disagreeing with it, I'm not being disagreeable.  
**[0:43:20-0:43:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:43:20):**  I said, I agree with everything Rudolph and Anna are saying.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:43:25):**  But none of what they're saying is addressing the cause of the problem.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:43:29):**  So if you keep talking about the symptoms of a problem, and what you need to address  
**[0:43:34-0:43:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:43:34):**  the symptoms, we know that will take centuries.  
**[0:43:38-0:43:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:43:38):**  So I'm saying, why don't we go for the jugular?  
**[0:43:42-0:43:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:43:42):**  Why don't we go directly to the cause of the problem?  
**[0:43:45-0:43:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:43:45):**  And both of all of us are admitting, the cause of the problem is at a higher level.  
**[0:43:51-0:43:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:43:51):**  It's not at the grassroots.  
**[0:43:53-0:44:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:43:53):**  As I said in my talk, it's at COP, we can't cure this at the grassroots.  
**[0:44:00-0:44:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:44:00):**  As Rudolph said, so rightly, farmers are the losers.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:44:03):**  Every time they have been throughout history.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:44:07):**  But ultimately, agricultural policies destroy civilizations.  
**[0:44:12-0:44:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:44:12):**  And then farmers continue to sustain themselves, but we abandon the cities.  
**[0:44:16-0:44:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:44:16):**  We can't afford to do that again.  
**[0:44:18-0:44:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:44:18):**  So I would just be repeating here, what I said in that short talk that I sent you, that  
**[0:44:25-0:44:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:44:25):**  I think if we just address the cause of it directly, you'll find the thinking follows.  
**[0:44:31-0:44:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:44:31):**  Now, let me give you an example.  
**[0:44:33-0:44:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:44:33):**  So I'm not just saying that.  
**[0:44:36-0:44:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:44:36):**  In 80 to 84, before I started training people like Kirk, who visited you, and in that period,  
**[0:44:45-0:44:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:44:45):**  the USDA commissioned me to put 2000 scientists, World Bank economists, professors of universities,  
**[0:44:54-0:45:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:44:54):**  agricultural colleges, through training on the holistic framework I was developing.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:45:00):**  Now, never before have we had 2000 scientists for two years concentrating on the cause of  
**[0:45:07-0:45:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:45:07):**  the problem.  
**[0:45:08-0:45:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:45:08):**  And we broke through.  
**[0:45:10-0:45:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:45:10):**  And they brought hundreds of their own policies, the bureaucrats did, to the training.  
**[0:45:15-0:45:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:45:15):**  They analyzed their policies with the new framework.  
**[0:45:19-0:45:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:45:19):**  And they, not me, concluded every single one of their policies was unsound.  
**[0:45:25-0:45:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:45:25):**  They said it was universal.

**[0:45:30-0:45:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:45:30):**  So we then learned in 1983, which is again a long time ago, that we could address that.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:45:38):**  So that's what I'm suggesting we do.  
**[0:45:40-0:45:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:45:40):**  Now we got a chance to do it with very divergent people at the policy level.  
**[0:45:47-0:45:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:45:47):**  That's why farmers suffer and everything else.

**[0:45:50-0:45:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:45:50):**  And I wrote about it in the third edition of my textbook with 35 members of parliament,  
**[0:45:57-0:46:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:45:57):**  the actual lawmakers in Zimbabwe.

**[0:46:07-0:46:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:46:07):**  like friendly children playing in the playpen.  
**[0:46:11-0:46:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:46:11):**  I mean, they were killing each other.  
**[0:46:14-0:46:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:46:14):**  And people appealed to me not to even talk about agriculture and land, because it would  
**[0:46:18-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:46:18):**  lead to violence.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:46:21):**  And so I didn't.  
**[0:46:22-0:46:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:46:22):**  I just talked to them about how governments develop policies, whether they're dictatorships  
**[0:46:28-0:46:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:46:28):**  or anything else, how the European Union develops policies, how Spain does every country.  
**[0:46:35-0:46:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:46:35):**  And it's the same.  
**[0:46:37-0:46:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:46:37):**  And then I talked about a different way of doing so.  
**[0:46:39-0:46:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:46:39):**  And I said, but we cannot have governments continue to develop policies based on needs  
**[0:46:45-0:46:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:46:45):**  and desires and problems a country or region has, and then base the policy on politicians  
**[0:46:52-0:46:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:46:52):**  trying to juggle the conflicting views of agricultural experts and economic experts,  
**[0:46:58-0:46:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:46:58):**  and pressure groups and so on.  
**[0:46:59-0:47:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:46:59):**  And the politicians trying to find their way through that, and come up with a policy, because  
**[0:47:04-0:47:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:47:04):**  always the biggest voice wins, the corporations win, the farmers lose, the country loses.  
**[0:47:11-0:47:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:47:11):**  Agriculture is the most destructive industry in the world today.  
**[0:47:16-0:47:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:47:16):**  As a result of that, so I said, why don't we just do it a different way that we've learned  
**[0:47:20-0:47:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:47:20):**  how.

**[0:47:25-0:47:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:47:25):**  anybody to discuss the problem, the state of the land or anything, because those are

**[0:47:38-0:47:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:47:38):**  And almost everybody you talk to in the world, whether they're a CEO of a corporation, or  
**[0:47:43-0:47:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:47:43):**  a farmer or a pastoralist, I guarantee they want better lives, cleaner food, cleaner water,

**[0:48:05-0:48:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:48:05):**  to each other and to the environment, without which we can't be ethical.

**[0:50:23-0:50:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:50:23):**  from initial collaboration and unification in this patient path that you've mentioned  
**[0:50:30-0:50:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:50:30):**  earlier?  
**[0:50:31-0:50:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:50:31):**  Well, that's such a big question.

**[0:51:07-0:51:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:51:07):**  What do you want for your kids?

**[0:51:15-0:51:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:51:15):**  because that's easily done and it's very paralyzing.  
**[0:51:19-0:51:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:51:19):**  It's about, so how do we want to live exactly?

**[0:51:29-0:51:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:51:29):**  and with agriculture and everything, but actually I'm a bearer of good news is that we can do  
**[0:51:33-0:51:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:51:33):**  things differently.  
**[0:51:34-0:51:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:51:34):**  You really can.

**[0:51:45-0:51:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:51:45):**  have when they want to make those changes is actually the legal framework.

**[0:53:00-0:53:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:53:00):**  can connect with each other.  
**[0:53:03-0:53:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:53:03):**  And those spaces now with online tools and virtual tools, there's a lot more possibilities  
**[0:53:11-0:53:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:53:11):**  to communicate.

**[0:53:18-0:53:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:53:18):**  on.

**[0:53:29-0:53:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:53:29):**  those farms be places that can be showcases.  
**[0:53:34-0:53:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:53:34):**  And so for example, next week, we were going to a farm and having a small visit to one  
**[0:53:39-0:53:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:53:39):**  of these farms with someone who is in a political position.  
**[0:53:44-0:53:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:53:44):**  And we hope to show them on the farm and to then enjoy the products of the farm so that  
**[0:53:52-0:53:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:53:52):**  the person can see the whole process and can see the family that is growing this and can  
**[0:53:58-0:54:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:53:58):**  sit at the table with the family and eat.  
**[0:54:01-0:54:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:54:01):**  And those kinds of experiences and conversations that can happen there, we hope can help open  
**[0:54:08-0:54:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:54:08):**  that possibility of changing things.  
**[0:54:11-0:54:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:54:11):**  However, I feel we're in a very humble position where I wish we had access to really high  
**[0:54:18-0:54:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:54:18):**  level government people such as Alan has had in the past.  
**[0:54:23-0:54:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:54:23):**  And for example, in the last year and a half, I participated in a group of experts that  
**[0:54:28-0:54:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:54:28):**  called from Europe, from 15 countries in Europe, to talk about sustainable beef production  
**[0:54:33-0:54:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:54:33):**  in Europe.  
**[0:54:34-0:54:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:54:34):**  And so we were all talking about holistic management, plant grazing, regenerative methodologies.  
**[0:54:41-0:54:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:54:41):**  It was really encouraging to see that in all of these 15 countries, there's people doing  
**[0:54:45-0:54:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:54:45):**  it.  
**[0:54:46-0:54:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:54:46):**  And there's champions who are key people who maybe some of them are farmers, some of them  
**[0:54:51-0:54:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:54:51):**  are not farmers.  
**[0:54:52-0:54:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:54:52):**  They're supporting farmers.  
**[0:54:53-0:54:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:54:53):**  But there's these key people who are pushing and who are promoting this in all of these  
**[0:54:58-0:55:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:54:58):**  countries.  
**[0:55:00-0:55:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:55:00):**  So we're not alone.  
**[0:55:01-0:55:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:55:01):**  But we were asked to give a report.  
**[0:55:03-0:55:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:55:03):**  And when we gave the report back after a lot of work for a whole year during COVID, that  
**[0:55:09-0:55:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:55:09):**  report is actually sitting in a drawer somewhere.  
**[0:55:14-0:55:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:55:14):**  So it's like, you know, the tools of the disease don't prove it.  
**[0:55:26-0:55:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:55:26):**  How do we get to that level?  
**[0:55:28-0:55:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:55:28):**  If anyone has that key, I'd be really grateful for that.  
**[0:55:33-0:55:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:55:33):**  Well Alan's got his hand up.  
**[0:55:35-0:55:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:55:35):**  So I think he wants to jump in there.  
**[0:55:36-0:55:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:55:36):**  Go ahead, Alan.  
**[0:55:37-0:55:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:55:37):**  I couldn't resist.  
**[0:55:38-0:55:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:55:38):**  And, you know, again, so I love what you're saying and everything.  
**[0:55:43-0:55:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:55:43):**  And you said you wish we had the access to those political leaders.  
**[0:55:48-0:55:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:55:48):**  You do have the access, only you limiting yourself.  
**[0:55:53-0:55:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:55:53):**  So instead of spending, well no, spend time with farmers showing what can be done, etc.  
**[0:55:58-0:56:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:55:58):**  But that's going to take years.  
**[0:56:01-0:56:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:56:01):**  Why not just take a delegation of farmers to see your president?  
**[0:56:05-0:56:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:56:05):**  And so why don't we carry on government as usual, carry on policies as usual, but concurrently  
**[0:56:12-0:56:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:56:12):**  let us just work with a group of our people and show what can be developed in the way  
**[0:56:18-0:56:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:56:18):**  of a different policy.  
**[0:56:20-0:56:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:56:20):**  And if you'd like it, adopt it.  
**[0:56:22-0:56:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:56:22):**  I mean, there's nothing to stop you doing that within one week.  
**[0:56:27-0:56:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:56:27):**  That is a fabulous idea, Alan.  
**[0:56:29-0:56:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:56:29):**  I'm taking note of that.  
**[0:56:31-0:56:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:56:31):**  Definitely.  
**[0:56:32-0:56:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:56:32):**  That's great.  
**[0:56:33-0:56:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:56:33):**  I'm really hoping that these panels will lead into revolutions.  
**[0:56:38-0:56:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:56:38):**  Yeah, definitely.  
**[0:56:39-0:56:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:56:39):**  I do see a comment there in the chat, which I have to agree with, which is about how people  
**[0:56:48-0:56:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:56:48):**  in those management and political levels are, on the one hand, some of them are very much  
**[0:56:55-0:57:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:56:55):**  high as that person is saying, high on the psychopathic scale, and they're in positions  
**[0:57:00-0:57:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:57:00):**  of power, and this is a reality.  
**[0:57:02-0:57:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:57:02):**  And then there's people who are genuinely trying to change things.  
**[0:57:05-0:57:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:57:05):**  I've got personal friends who are great activists and super motivated, have gone into politics  
**[0:57:11-0:57:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:57:11):**  to change, really change things.  
**[0:57:13-0:57:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:57:13):**  And they find themselves either completely absorbed by the machine of paperwork, stuff,  
**[0:57:20-0:57:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:57:20):**  processes and all of that, and they just fall down that rabbit hole, or they leave in despair.  
**[0:57:28-0:57:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:57:28):**  And so it's like the good people don't get to really make those changes.  
**[0:57:34-0:57:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:57:34):**  So yeah, it's definitely a challenge.  
**[0:57:38-0:57:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:57:38):**  Huge.  
**[0:57:39-0:57:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-ana-digon-and-rudolf-buehler-on-building-community-in-agriculture/#t=0:57:39):**  Back to you, Oliver.

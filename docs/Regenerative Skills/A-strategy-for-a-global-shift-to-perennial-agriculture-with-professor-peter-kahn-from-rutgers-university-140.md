**[0:00:00-0:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:00:13):**  Here we dive deep into the diverse worlds of regenerative living, permaculture, and  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:00:17):**  natural building as we aspire to help you reach your highest potential for yourself,  
**[0:00:22-0:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:00:22):**  for your community, and for this beautiful planet that we share.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:00:25):**  As always, I'm your host Oliver Gaucher, and I'm thrilled to guide you through this  
**[0:00:29-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:00:29):**  week's episode, so let's jump right in!  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:01:00):**  Now in all the research that I've been doing for this ongoing series on reforestation and  
**[0:01:05-0:01:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:01:05):**  agroforestry, I've struggled to find any reports or serious articles that outline the  
**[0:01:09-0:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:01:09):**  potential steps to transition the world's agricultural model on a large scale from one  
**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:01:14):**  that's based on annual crops and the intensive cultivation that they require to one based  
**[0:01:19-0:01:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:01:19):**  on perennial crops.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:01:21):**  The advantages are obvious, from a decrease in soil disturbance and fertilization due  
**[0:01:25-0:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:01:25):**  to the natural cycles that keep roots in the ground and hold soils in place against erosion,  
**[0:01:30-0:01:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:01:30):**  to increases in biodiversity and animal habitat.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:01:33):**  The list goes on and on, and though many people have advocated for this switch, I couldn't  
**[0:01:38-0:01:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:01:38):**  find any longer term strategy until I came across an article called, Investing in Perennial  
**[0:01:43-0:01:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:01:43):**  Crops to Sustainably Feed the World, which was co-authored by my guest today, Peter Kahn.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:01:49):**  Peter is a tenured professor of biochemistry at Rutgers University who became interested  
**[0:01:54-0:01:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:01:54):**  in the potential of perennial crops from speaking with a colleague of his who was studying this  
**[0:01:58-0:01:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:01:58):**  topic.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:01:59):**  Now we cover a lot of ground in a short time in this interview.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:02:02):**  Peter starts by explaining how every previous society throughout history that has relied  
**[0:02:07-0:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:02:07):**  on annual grain production as their primary food source has collapsed, and how up until  
**[0:02:12-0:02:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:02:12):**  now we've avoided this fate by exploiting the great carbon stores of the earth in the  
**[0:02:17-0:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:02:17):**  form of petroleum in order to compensate for the damage we've been doing to our ecology.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:02:23):**  We move from there to the already proven methods of perennial cultivation that could be expanded  
**[0:02:28-0:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:02:28):**  to start to replace the annual grains that we now rely on.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:02:31):**  Peter also breaks down some of the steps proposed in the article on how international organizations  
**[0:02:37-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:02:37):**  and alliances would need to be fostered to promote new cultivation methods and also to  
**[0:02:42-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:02:42):**  develop perennial grain replacements for the short term transition.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:02:46):**  We also get into the tough questions of breaking down the exploitative economic and political  
**[0:02:50-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:02:50):**  structures that have given us the extractive industrial models that rule the agricultural  
**[0:02:55-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:02:55):**  landscape and some of the existential issues that we would need to grapple with before  
**[0:03:00-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:03:00):**  real change in our society could be accomplished.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:03:03):**  It was really encouraging for me to see that serious academics are starting to explore  
**[0:03:07-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:03:07):**  the strategies towards a global transition towards regenerative agriculture and how the  
**[0:03:11-0:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:03:11):**  revival of forest ecosystems is included in that strategy.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:03:15):**  There is obviously a long road ahead, but the increasing awareness of the urgency of  
**[0:03:19-0:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:03:19):**  this transition is a good sign that respect and value for the earth that we all depend  
**[0:03:24-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:03:24):**  on is increasing.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:03:26):**  I've included a link to the article that we discuss in the show notes for this episode  
**[0:03:30-0:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:03:30):**  so you can take a look for yourself and decide if the plan outlined by these professors seems  
**[0:03:35-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:03:35):**  feasible or if there are pieces missing.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:03:38):**  If you have any alternative ideas or ways to expand on the plan in the article, I would  
**[0:03:42-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:03:42):**  love to hear your ideas.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:03:44):**  You can write to me directly at info at abundantedge.com or leave comments for this episode on the  
**[0:03:49-0:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:03:49):**  website.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:03:50):**  So, with that out of the way, I'll hand things over now to Peter.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:03:53):**  Hey, Peter, thank you so much for taking the time to be with me here today.  
**[0:03:57-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:03:57):**  How are you doing?  
**[0:03:58-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:03:58):**  I'm doing all right.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:03:59):**  How are you?  
**[0:04:00-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:04:00):**  I'm doing well.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:04:01):**  We're both kind of making the transition towards into winter now, but it seems like it's going  
**[0:04:07-0:04:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:04:07):**  to be a lot colder for you in New Jersey than it is for me here in Spain.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:04:11):**  I imagine.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:04:12):**  Where are you in Spain?  
**[0:04:13-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:04:13):**  I'm about 30 minutes north from Barcelona, so not far from the Med.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:04:17):**  We're in the Mediterranean climate.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:04:19):**  It's quite nice.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:04:20):**  Right.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:04:21):**  Well, hey, look, I really enjoyed the article that you and your team put together focusing  
**[0:04:25-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:04:25):**  on the potential of perennial crops to sustainably feed the world, and that's what we're going  
**[0:04:31-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:04:31):**  to kind of focus on today.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:04:33):**  But before we discuss the article, could you tell our listeners a little bit about your  
**[0:04:36-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:04:36):**  personal background and how you and your team came to focus on perennial agriculture production?  
**[0:04:42-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:04:42):**  Well, I'm a biochemist by trade.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:04:45):**  My title is Professor of Biochemistry at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:04:52):**  The teaching and research I do directly in biochemistry has very little to do with agriculture,  
**[0:04:59-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:04:59):**  tree crops, or anything of the sort, except in that when you study biochemistry, you're  
**[0:05:05-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:05:05):**  studying systems.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:05:07):**  A cell is an integrated system of many parts, an organism likewise.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:05:13):**  And when you think about an ecological system, the systematics of it are no different from  
**[0:05:18-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:05:18):**  those of a cell in that parts are closely interrelated.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:05:23):**  So I got interested in agriculture because the fellow who had the office above me was  
**[0:05:28-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:05:28):**  an agriculturalist who worked on turf grasses, which are perennials.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:05:33):**  And as he was approaching retirement, he got interested in tree crops, and he knew about  
**[0:05:38-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:05:38):**  crops all over the world.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:05:40):**  He was really well versed.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:05:43):**  We used to go to lunch together, and he gradually got me more and more interested, and then  
**[0:05:47-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:05:47):**  I started working on it.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:05:48):**  So now, like I mentioned earlier, I contacted you because of this incredible article called  
**[0:05:54-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:05:54):**  Investing in Perennial Crops to Sustainably Feed the World.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:05:58):**  And with your understanding of systems related to biochemistry, let's talk a little bit about  
**[0:06:04-0:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:06:04):**  the primary disadvantages to give us context here of sort of the mass annual crop production  
**[0:06:09-0:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:06:09):**  around the world and how perennial agriculture could step in and address some of these.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:06:16):**  Well, every human civilization that has depended upon annual grains for the root of their sustenance  
**[0:06:26-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:06:26):**  has collapsed.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:06:27):**  There have been no exceptions, and ours is headed in the same direction.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:06:33):**  Even if we had no problems with climate change, if it didn't exist as a problem, we would  
**[0:06:38-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:06:38):**  still be heading for collapse.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:06:40):**  And the reason is that annual monocrop agriculture gradually erodes the land's capacity to provide  
**[0:06:49-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:06:49):**  further nutrition.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:06:50):**  And the way it's done in this country with huge tracts of things like corn and soybeans  
**[0:06:55-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:06:55):**  and what have you, with huge chemical inputs and all sorts of other procedures that erode  
**[0:07:01-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:07:01):**  the soil's capacity to nurture us, eventually the system will fall apart.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:07:09):**  We have a dead zone at the mouth of the Mississippi River, and there are dead zones all over the  
**[0:07:13-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:07:13):**  world for similar reasons in which agricultural waste and fertilizer and what have you have  
**[0:07:19-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:07:19):**  leached down the rivers and produced increasing inability of the soil to support us unless  
**[0:07:30-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:07:30):**  it receives chemical inputs.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:07:32):**  And the chemical inputs come primarily from petroleum.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:07:34):**  Now, so given this fact that you mentioned, all previous civilizations that have relied  
**[0:07:40-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:07:40):**  on annual crop production in order to sustain themselves have collapsed.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:07:44):**  How has this cycle been able to continually perpetuate itself to the point that we have  
**[0:07:49-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:07:49):**  today, which has basically nearly wiped out the biodiversity throughout our planet?  
**[0:07:56-0:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:07:56):**  Well, it's proceeded that way because it has been able to provide food and in settled ways  
**[0:08:03-0:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:08:03):**  for settled communities since the agricultural revolution.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:08:09):**  And what has enabled it to keep going is humans have taken over more and more of the planet  
**[0:08:15-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:08:15):**  using more and more land to grow food.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:08:18):**  And if you take over virgin land and start growing food, you can do so for quite some  
**[0:08:22-0:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:08:22):**  time before it falls apart.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:08:24):**  Now, so as we start to reach the limits of where this type of food production can continue  
**[0:08:31-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:08:31):**  to expand to, and at the same time, the resources, the petroleum products that have sort of artificially  
**[0:08:38-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:08:38):**  propped up this system up until this point are starting to become not only more expensive,  
**[0:08:44-0:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:08:44):**  but our sources of extracting them are starting to collapse.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:08:48):**  Let's talk about how perennials can start to, I guess, walk back some of the destructive  
**[0:08:53-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:08:53):**  aspects of annual production and what potential that they have to create the food needed to  
**[0:08:58-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:08:58):**  sustain this population.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:09:00):**  Well, there are a whole range of things are in progress in various parts of the world.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:09:06):**  You undoubtedly heard about permaculture, where pioneering work has been occurring anywhere  
**[0:09:12-0:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:09:12):**  from Australia through this country into Europe.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:09:17):**  In Salina, Kansas, there's a place called the Land Institute, which is trying to develop  
**[0:09:23-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:09:23):**  perennial grains that can be planted once and harvested thereafter, year after year  
**[0:09:29-0:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:09:29):**  after year.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:09:32):**  But they want to do this in mixed culture, in which they have multiple species growing,  
**[0:09:37-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:09:37):**  mimicking the ecology of the American prairie.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:09:43):**  That was an ecological arrangement that was stable for thousands of years.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:09:48):**  And if that could be mimicked in a way that produced enough grain to feed people, that  
**[0:09:53-0:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:09:53):**  would be one part of a perennial plant solution.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:09:58):**  They are at the point now where they have a perennial grain called kernza, which actually  
**[0:10:06-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:10:06):**  makes a very good flower, and they're in the process of commercializing it.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:10:11):**  Where they're going next with that is to add additional species so that they have the mixed  
**[0:10:17-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:10:17):**  species agricultural crop that they are aiming for.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:10:21):**  It's a very good operation.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:10:23):**  So that's one instance.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:10:26):**  Another describes the fact that, well, some of its prongs describe the fact that smaller  
**[0:10:33-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:10:33):**  farms produce more calories per acre than large farms do.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:10:42):**  Large farms produce more calories per man-hour work.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:10:46):**  That's because of all the automation that goes into them, automation which compacts  
**[0:10:51-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:10:51):**  the soil, which is destructive of the soil fertility, and so forth.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:10:56):**  But small farms with a wide variety of crops in what has come to be called restoration  
**[0:11:01-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:11:01):**  agriculture offers the possibility that farmers can, number one, make a living, and number  
**[0:11:07-0:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:11:07):**  two, produce enough to feed a lot of people.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:11:11):**  The more of that that is encouraged, the better.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:11:15):**  To do it, there will be political problems that will have to be overcome, but that's  
**[0:11:20-0:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:11:20):**  a somewhat different subject.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:11:21):**  Certainly.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:11:22):**  Now, you mentioned kernza, this new perennial grain that is being promoted as an alternative  
**[0:11:29-0:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:11:29):**  to annual grain production.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:11:31):**  Can you tell me a little bit about how this new grain has been developed and why there  
**[0:11:37-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:11:37):**  has been a focus on developing new options when there are already widely cultivated perennial  
**[0:11:44-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:11:44):**  grains, the one that comes to mind personally is sorghum.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:11:48):**  Is there an advantage to these improved grains and the process that it takes to getting them  
**[0:11:54-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:11:54):**  there, or should there perhaps be more of a priority put on existing perennial grains  
**[0:12:01-0:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:12:01):**  and how those can be promoted for their particular advantages or expanded into other climates?  
**[0:12:08-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:12:08):**  I believe sorghum is an annual, isn't it?  
**[0:12:11-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:12:11):**  I believe sorghum is a perennial.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:12:13):**  I may have that wrong.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:12:15):**  It's been, sorry, go ahead.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:12:20):**  The kernza is derived from something called an intermediate wheat grass.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:12:26):**  The idea is to have something that produces at a high level.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:12:31):**  The land instance, who people would certainly have no objection to adding in sorghum or  
**[0:12:36-0:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:12:36):**  using sorghum or any of the ones that now exist.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:12:40):**  What has to happen is basically two things.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:12:42):**  They have to be made able to grow with minimal input from the outside, minimal fertilizer,  
**[0:12:48-0:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:12:48):**  minimal anything else.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:12:51):**  And secondly, they have to have increased yields sufficient to be able to feed people.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:12:57):**  And thirdly, it has to be possible to avoid large monocrop tracts planted to the same  
**[0:13:04-0:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:13:04):**  crop because a huge monocrop acreage is a disaster waiting to happen.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:13:09):**  You're looking for plant diseases to take over, insect infestations to take over and  
**[0:13:16-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:13:16):**  so forth.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:13:17):**  Now, does this implicate the idea that only improved perennials will be suitable to take  
**[0:13:24-0:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:13:24):**  on the task of feeding the world's population the way the annuals have done up until now?  
**[0:13:30-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:13:30):**  There are undoubtedly perennials that could be used as they are.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:13:34):**  What are some of the ones that come to mind that are currently widely cultivated around  
**[0:13:38-0:13:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:13:38):**  the world?  
**[0:13:40-0:13:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:13:40):**  And have you identified some of the reasons why they haven't taken more of a prominent  
**[0:13:45-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:13:45):**  place in the world's diet?  
**[0:13:48-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:13:48):**  Partly the advertising that goes with the grains that we now use kind of swamp anything  
**[0:13:55-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:13:55):**  else.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:13:56):**  If you don't have a market for your grain, you're not going to grow it if you're a farmer  
**[0:14:01-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:14:01):**  unless you want to go broke.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:14:03):**  As to which other perennials are out there that could be used, I don't really know.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:14:08):**  Sorghum is a case in point.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:14:11):**  There are undoubtedly others.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:14:13):**  I don't really have a good feel for that right now.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:14:16):**  So let's talk about where perennial farming is at the moment and what would need to change  
**[0:14:21-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:14:21):**  for it to be able to step up and take over more of the market share for annual production.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:14:27):**  There are a fair number of restoration agriculture people and permaculture people around the  
**[0:14:32-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:14:32):**  world.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:14:34):**  In order for them to take over a market share, the dominance of market by what we now call  
**[0:14:40-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:14:40):**  agribusiness is going to have to be reduced or eliminated.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:14:44):**  When firms like ConAgra, Monsanto and so forth control a huge fraction of what agriculture  
**[0:14:51-0:14:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:14:51):**  happens, we're in trouble.  
**[0:14:55-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:14:55):**  They get subsidies of one kind or another, direct or indirect.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:14:59):**  The fossil fuels that they use are subsidized by things like the oil depletion allowance.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:15:05):**  The machinery makers are in a sense taking part in this, in a sense they really are.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:15:11):**  And they're using fossil fuels to make the machines and so it goes.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:15:16):**  Other resources are going there as well.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:15:19):**  If we want to encourage restoration agriculture and we know how to do restoration agriculture,  
**[0:15:27-0:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:15:27):**  there are farmers who are doing it successfully.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:15:30):**  If we want to encourage it, the playing field has to be made at least level.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:15:35):**  It is not level now.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:15:37):**  Agriculture, as we now know it, is heavily subsidized.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:15:43):**  Those subsidies are indirect.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:15:46):**  Whoever heard about cutting back on the oil depletion allowance or the depreciation that  
**[0:15:52-0:15:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:15:52):**  mineral companies get for mining, that's part of the agricultural problem.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:15:58):**  And until people understand that, we're not going to get anywhere.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:16:00):**  That was one of my favorite parts about the article that you and your colleagues put together  
**[0:16:05-0:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:16:05):**  and how it outlines some of the systems in place that are preventing any kind of progress  
**[0:16:11-0:16:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:16:11):**  to be made on the environmental destruction that annual production is causing.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:16:16):**  I know that you talked about there needing to be some major political changes, which  
**[0:16:21-0:16:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:16:21):**  though there are recommendations in this article, are very difficult to predict or instigate  
**[0:16:26-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:16:26):**  for.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:16:27):**  So let's talk about some of the steps that can be taken in order to prioritize perennial  
**[0:16:33-0:16:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:16:33):**  production moving forward.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:16:36):**  One of the arguments that the agriculture department makes and that some of our political  
**[0:16:41-0:16:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:16:41):**  people make is that they want to encourage family farms.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:16:47):**  And there are family farms out there, many of which do monocrop agriculture.  
**[0:16:52-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:16:52):**  If one could induce the Department of Agriculture to make low interest loans or subsidies available  
**[0:17:00-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:17:00):**  for people who want to set up restoration agriculture farms, that would be very good.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:17:07):**  Another thing that could be done is colleges of agriculture, of which there's one at least  
**[0:17:11-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:17:11):**  in every state, often more than one, could put restoration agriculture, perennial cropping,  
**[0:17:19-0:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:17:19):**  as part of the curriculum.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:17:21):**  Those are just a couple of things that come to mind as we're talking here.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:17:25):**  And what do you think are some of the other barriers to get these steps from happening?  
**[0:17:29-0:17:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:17:29):**  Do you think it's simply a matter of money being put in to perpetuate sort of the industrial  
**[0:17:33-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:17:33):**  agriculture system?  
**[0:17:35-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:17:35):**  Or are there other roadblocks that are perhaps more likely to be overcome as costs start  
**[0:17:41-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:17:41):**  to rise for the inputs in industrial agriculture?  
**[0:17:44-0:17:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:17:44):**  Oh yes.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:17:45):**  In fact, there's a good deal of this in progress right now.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:17:50):**  Local farmers markets are terrific in that you end up establishing a relationship between  
**[0:17:57-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:17:57):**  the consumer and the farm.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:17:59):**  We have a couple of them around me here in New Brunswick, and we go to them frequently.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:18:06):**  Even though the prices of some of the things at the farmers markets are a little higher  
**[0:18:09-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:18:09):**  than you pay in the supermarket, you know what you're getting.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:18:12):**  And you know that there are no chemicals used by way of insecticides or pesticides on them.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:18:20):**  You know also that you're buying direct from a farmer or from a farm cooperative rather  
**[0:18:27-0:18:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:18:27):**  than having it pass through the hands of a large middleman.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:18:32):**  These farmer markets are really very good, and the more they are patronized, the more  
**[0:18:37-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:18:37):**  they'll grow.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:18:38):**  And the more they grow, the more farmers will have an incentive to change the way they farm.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:18:45):**  So we've talked a little bit about shifting over major grain production to perennial grasses  
**[0:18:52-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:18:52):**  or grains.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:18:53):**  Do you see there to be a potential for tree and perhaps shrub production that have much  
**[0:18:59-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:18:59):**  more benefits for the ecology, especially as we need to repair damaged lands due to  
**[0:19:05-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:19:05):**  previous or current agricultural practices?  
**[0:19:09-0:19:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:19:09):**  They offer an awful lot.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:19:11):**  For one thing, trees, like all perennials, have deeper roots so they can access a wider  
**[0:19:17-0:19:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:19:17):**  range of nutrients in the soil.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:19:19):**  They can also access water more readily and use it more effectively.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:19:24):**  They provide food in many, many ways.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:19:27):**  There are nut trees of all kinds.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:19:30):**  Pecans are an excellent use.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:19:33):**  There are many trees that provide long beans, such as mesket, which have been used by the  
**[0:19:41-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:19:41):**  Native Americans, the original Americans, for thousands of years, all of which are useful.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:19:50):**  Moreover, trees planted in multi-crop with multiple species, not huge expanses of the  
**[0:19:56-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:19:56):**  same tree.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:19:59):**  Trees can provide continuing production year after year with little or no input, perhaps  
**[0:20:04-0:20:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:20:04):**  a bit of trimming.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:20:06):**  They provide shade.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:20:08):**  They allow other crops to be grown in the shade underneath the trees.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:20:12):**  They allow vines to be grown with the trees used as trellises.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:20:16):**  The number of possible combinations is almost infinite.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:20:20):**  There's an old book by J. Russell Smith on tree crops, a perennial agriculture, in which  
**[0:20:29-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:20:29):**  he describes the island of Corsica.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:20:32):**  This was back in the 1920s, in which there are chestnut forests in the mountains that  
**[0:20:37-0:20:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:20:37):**  have been there for hundreds and hundreds of years, villages dotted along the mountains  
**[0:20:43-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:20:43):**  that thrive on these chestnut forests as their primary source of production.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:20:47):**  There's no reason not to do similar things, depending upon the local ecology elsewhere.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:20:54):**  Perhaps not with chestnuts, but with other trees.  
**[0:20:56-0:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:20:56):**  Why not?  
**[0:20:58-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:20:58):**  The more of that, the better.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:21:01):**  Up until now, we've talked a lot about grain and vegetable production.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:21:07):**  A lot of what is vilified in modern agriculture is the importance put on the production of  
**[0:21:13-0:21:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:21:13):**  animal protein, especially beef and larger cattle.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:21:18):**  Do you see much of a potential for the integration of perennial crops and livestock production  
**[0:21:26-0:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:21:26):**  as well?  
**[0:21:27-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:21:27):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:21:28):**  If you're going to run permaculture farms or restoration agriculture farms, livestock  
**[0:21:34-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:21:34):**  need to be part of it.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:21:37):**  The livestock provide fertilizer when they're being pastured, and if they're pastured carefully,  
**[0:21:43-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:21:43):**  they can encourage the growth of grasses and other useful plants in the areas that they  
**[0:21:49-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:21:49):**  are moved from, from one period of time to another.  
**[0:21:55-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:21:55):**  A problem that current animal agriculture has is huge tracts of things like corn are  
**[0:22:01-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:22:01):**  used to feed the animals, and it's destructive of the land, and it produces animal protein  
**[0:22:09-0:22:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:22:09):**  that's not the best of quality, but certainly usable.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:22:15):**  If you include animals as a necessary part of the ecosystem of a restoration farm, you  
**[0:22:22-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:22:22):**  can produce a fair amount of meat that way.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:22:24):**  You will not produce as much of any given crop, animal or otherwise, on a restoration  
**[0:22:30-0:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:22:30):**  farm as you might with the same acreage in a monocrop agriculture, but you'll produce  
**[0:22:39-0:22:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:22:39):**  enough that you can feed lots of people, and in doing so, you will not only maintain the  
**[0:22:45-0:22:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:22:45):**  land, you can enrich the land as you do so.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:22:48):**  I like that.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:22:49):**  That's very well explained.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:22:52):**  There's even justification for using horses as part of the landscape in cultivating the  
**[0:22:59-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:22:59):**  land.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:23:02):**  If you use horses, you can cultivate in places that tractors can't go.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:23:08):**  Can you use them everywhere for everything?  
**[0:23:09-0:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:23:09):**  No, certainly not, but there are many places where you could use them.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:23:14):**  It seems like in every way that perennial crops are implemented, they have the great  
**[0:23:20-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:23:20):**  advantage of all of the extra ecosystem services, as you mentioned.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:23:25):**  One of the things that I like that was focused on in the article is the potential for these  
**[0:23:30-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:23:30):**  systems to be implemented where current annual production is simply not feasible, such as  
**[0:23:37-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:23:37):**  in marginal lands or on places with steep slopes, and places that are not considered  
**[0:23:43-0:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:23:43):**  arable land could still support a wide variety of tree species and integrated polycultures,  
**[0:23:50-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:23:50):**  such as you mentioned before.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:23:52):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:23:53-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:23:53):**  You could start there in land that isn't being used and gradually spread out from there.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:24:01):**  Can you give me perhaps some examples of successful implementation of perennial agriculture that  
**[0:24:07-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:24:07):**  people could follow or look into?  
**[0:24:09-0:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:24:09):**  Well, there's a fellow by the name of Mark Sheppard who has published a book on restoration  
**[0:24:21-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:24:21):**  agriculture.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:24:24):**  He lives out in the west and he has had a restoration agriculture farm where he makes  
**[0:24:30-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:24:30):**  a very good living for over 20 years.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:24:35):**  I would recommend his book right away.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:24:39):**  Yeah, Mark Sheppard is one of my favorite resources to go to, not only for his book,  
**[0:24:44-0:24:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:24:44):**  his farm is well profiled in a great documentary called Inhabit.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:24:48):**  And in fact, I've actually done an interview with him on this podcast at the beginning  
**[0:24:53-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:24:53):**  of the previous season.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:24:54):**  He's one of my favorite resources to point to people too.  
**[0:24:58-0:24:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:24:58):**  Right.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:24:59):**  There's another writer by the name of Wendell Berry in Kentucky who has written anything  
**[0:25:05-0:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:25:05):**  from novels to poetry to major essays on agriculture and who is in addition to a well-known writer  
**[0:25:14-0:25:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:25:14):**  is a farmer.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:25:17):**  His classic book, The Unsettling of America is perhaps one of the best that's been written  
**[0:25:23-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:25:23):**  as an argument in favor of getting away from annual monocrop agriculture.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:25:29):**  Moreover, he ties it very, very well to the political structure that encourages things  
**[0:25:35-0:25:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:25:35):**  as they are in which the land is drained of resources, including drained of people.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:25:41):**  And you end up with rural destruction of the sort that we're now well familiar with.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:25:47):**  It even ties in with the racial problem in this country.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:25:50):**  And his other book, The Hidden Wound describes the agricultural roots of our racial problems.  
**[0:25:57-0:25:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:25:57):**  So the connections are there.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:25:58):**  They're everywhere.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:26:01):**  And I think one of the problems that we all face is getting people to be aware of that.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:26:05):**  I'm really glad that you mentioned the way that some of those other social ills tie in  
**[0:26:10-0:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:26:10):**  to this history of destructive processes in agriculture that our society has been reliant  
**[0:26:15-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:26:15):**  on for hundreds, if not thousands of years.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:26:18):**  In your article, you and your team take a great opportunity to outline some of the ways  
**[0:26:25-0:26:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:26:25):**  that perennial agriculture can be implemented on a global scale.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:26:29):**  Could you walk me through some of the developments for this potential improvement on the Green  
**[0:26:35-0:26:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:26:35):**  Revolution as the article outlines?  
**[0:26:38-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:26:38):**  The Green Revolution has been heavily dependent upon external inputs to make these short stalk  
**[0:26:47-0:26:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:26:47):**  crops grow well.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:26:50):**  So there has been the need for fertilizer and the fertilizers are what are necessary  
**[0:26:56-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:26:56):**  to make them grow well.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:26:58):**  They do well when you supply the fertilizer.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:27:01):**  They've also ended up needing large amounts of insecticides and pesticides of various  
**[0:27:07-0:27:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:27:07):**  sorts, which again, enable these crops to grow well and provide food.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:27:17):**  But Dorian Borlaug saw the Green Revolution as a temporary measure.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:27:23):**  If you go back and look at his writings, he saw that as a way to avoid immediate massive  
**[0:27:29-0:27:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:27:29):**  famine.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:27:30):**  And I'm all for that.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:27:31):**  I don't like the idea of millions of people dying of starvation, but he saw it as an intermediate  
**[0:27:36-0:27:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:27:36):**  step.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:27:37):**  And the intermediate step is going to have to be moving away from huge external inputs.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:27:44):**  It's as though the land is on chemotherapy.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:27:48):**  And the chemotherapy is what you give to somebody to cure them of a disease or to maintain them  
**[0:27:56-0:28:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:27:56):**  in a functioning capability in spite of the disease.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:28:00):**  But there's a limit to how far chemotherapy will take you.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:28:03):**  And so I think what one has to do is to try and move away from annual crops as well as  
**[0:28:10-0:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:28:10):**  we can, as quickly as we can, in as many ways as we can.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:28:14):**  I hope this answers your question or at least addresses it.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:28:17):**  It does.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:28:18):**  Now let's talk about some of the kind of systematic approaches within governmental levels, within  
**[0:28:23-0:28:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:28:23):**  funding levels, and the types of organizations that are outlined in this article that are  
**[0:28:29-0:28:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:28:29):**  prescribed to help to make that transition on a global scale.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:28:33):**  One of the things we proposed is a series of research stations all around the world,  
**[0:28:40-0:28:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:28:40):**  each of them funded with an endowment from which the income would provide the funds to  
**[0:28:51-0:28:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:28:51):**  develop and enhance perennial crops, and in addition to work on the sociology and politics  
**[0:28:58-0:29:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:28:58):**  and economics of it all.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:29:01):**  These are sort of mimicked on the Vavilov research stations that were proposed by the  
**[0:29:06-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:29:06):**  Russian biologist Vavilov many, many years ago.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:29:11):**  The idea would be these would become centers from which perennial work could spread out.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:29:19):**  If we had a number of these centers in every agricultural area, half a dozen in the United  
**[0:29:24-0:29:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:29:24):**  States or maybe only a few, a few in Europe, a few in South America, a few in China, and  
**[0:29:29-0:29:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:29:29):**  so forth, it would enhance the capacity of farmers to use perennials as better research  
**[0:29:39-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:29:39):**  is done to describe which ones would work and what kind of an agricultural environment.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:29:45):**  The environment of the American Southeast is not going to support the same kind of crops  
**[0:29:50-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:29:50):**  as the Northwest.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:29:52):**  Likewise, local environments all over the world are going to have to have specialized  
**[0:29:58-0:30:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:29:58):**  or semi-specialized crops developed for them or adapted to them in order for this to succeed.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:30:05):**  So setting up these things is not very expensive.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:30:10):**  In the article, I put some numbers down as ballpark estimates of what it would cost to  
**[0:30:16-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:30:16):**  do this.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:30:17):**  I don't remember the exact numbers, but they're not very large on a worldwide basis.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:30:21):**  I mean, the figures themselves can be daunting if you see them from kind of a smaller funding  
**[0:30:25-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:30:25):**  context.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:30:27):**  I believe it was somewhere around $3 billion.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:30:30):**  But like you said, with the funding mechanisms such as tapping into the World Bank or other  
**[0:30:35-0:30:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:30:35):**  multinational organizations, this is a relatively small amount of money and could definitely  
**[0:30:41-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:30:41):**  be used to mobilize this on a much larger scale.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:30:45):**  Now as someone who sort of speaks and represents this idea of permaculture and restoration  
**[0:30:51-0:30:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:30:51):**  farming like you've mentioned a few times now, I think that some of the apprehension  
**[0:30:56-0:31:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:30:56):**  about having regenerative and restoration farming taken over by multinational organizations  
**[0:31:02-0:31:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:31:02):**  or governments in general is that it could be leveraged to a similar style of domination  
**[0:31:10-0:31:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:31:10):**  of the industries that are currently being exercised by the industrial farming mechanisms  
**[0:31:19-0:31:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:31:19):**  and the companies that represent them at the moment.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:31:23):**  Do you see there being a risk for the type of monoculture and extractive practices to  
**[0:31:28-0:31:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:31:28):**  continue even if the switch is made to perennials plants?  
**[0:31:33-0:31:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:31:33):**  Bingo.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:31:34):**  You hit the nail on the head.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:31:37):**  In fact, Wendell Berrien is writing points to this very, very clearly that as long as  
**[0:31:44-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:31:44):**  you have an economy organized on hierarchical lines in which things are mostly top down,  
**[0:31:51-0:31:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:31:51):**  in which power is in the hands of a few people rather than many distributed power, as long  
**[0:31:56-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:31:56):**  as you have a hierarchical organization of your society and your economy, this is a major  
**[0:32:02-0:32:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:32:02):**  risk.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:32:03):**  And so with that continuing to be a risk, maybe just from your personal perspective  
**[0:32:08-0:32:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:32:08):**  or opinions, what are some of the sort of difficult decisions or the political aspects  
**[0:32:14-0:32:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:32:14):**  that you talked about earlier on that kind of need to be resolved for this to be a step  
**[0:32:19-0:32:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:32:19):**  forward and not just a lateral move where certain species replace others, but the same  
**[0:32:24-0:32:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:32:24):**  type of hierarchical structure continues to dominate the food industry?  
**[0:32:29-0:32:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:32:29):**  It won't work unless people become aware that the hierarchical organization of our whole  
**[0:32:33-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:32:33):**  economy and our political affairs is the obstacle.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:32:39):**  Unless people realize that that's the obstacle, we're not going to get anywhere.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:32:43):**  Everything else is just sort of a different head of the same beast, so to speak.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:32:49):**  Bingo.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:32:50):**  So, man, I'm kind of wondering where to go with that next, because we could continue  
**[0:32:55-0:32:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:32:55):**  to talk about all of the different advantages for the ecosystem, not only through their  
**[0:32:59-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:32:59):**  purposes, but the potential for ecological food production that could replace the extractive  
**[0:33:04-0:33:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:33:04):**  methods of annual production as they are.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:33:07):**  But until we start to fix some of the root causes, I'm not sure exactly what to ask you  
**[0:33:14-0:33:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:33:14):**  next.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:33:15):**  What are some of your opinions on where to move from here or perhaps what people listening  
**[0:33:19-0:33:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:33:19):**  at home can do to effect a change at a local level?  
**[0:33:23-0:33:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:33:23):**  If you insist that the manager of your local supermarket by increasing amounts of locally  
**[0:33:29-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:33:29):**  produced produce, that will help.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:33:33):**  Even though that supermarket may be part of a large chain, by forcing it through public  
**[0:33:39-0:33:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:33:39):**  pressure to buy locally, you improve the possibilities.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:33:45):**  And when the supermarkets oppose doing it, then people can mobilize and ask, why does  
**[0:33:52-0:33:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:33:52):**  the supermarket have that much power?  
**[0:33:56-0:33:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:33:56):**  So that's one possibility.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:33:58):**  Another is you can start taking over your state departments of agriculture and get state  
**[0:34:03-0:34:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:34:03):**  subsidies for restoration farming within the various states.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:34:08):**  It's too hard to take on the federal government directly.  
**[0:34:12-0:34:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:34:12):**  It's too well funded by lobbyists or too well lobbied by funded lobbyists, excuse me.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:34:19):**  But state departments of agriculture are not as well known, and they are more susceptible  
**[0:34:24-0:34:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:34:24):**  to public pressure.  
**[0:34:26-0:34:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:34:26):**  I really like that you mentioned that about the power of consumers to have an influence  
**[0:34:30-0:34:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:34:30):**  on their food economies.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:34:33):**  I previously did an interview with John Steinman, the author of Grocery Story, the promise of  
**[0:34:38-0:34:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:34:38):**  food co-ops in the age of grocery giants.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:34:41):**  And that's exactly what he spoke about, especially with the focus on supporting small community  
**[0:34:46-0:34:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:34:46):**  supported co-op grocery stores and their ability to move power away from the monopoly that  
**[0:34:55-0:35:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:34:55):**  grocery stores have, not only on the way food is packaged and presented, but every level  
**[0:35:00-0:35:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:35:00):**  of the agricultural system that has to cater to the demands of how those large, fairly  
**[0:35:07-0:35:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:35:07):**  monopolized chains buy products.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:35:10):**  They're literally dictating the way things are produced to feed the way that they are  
**[0:35:16-0:35:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:35:16):**  packaged and sold.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:35:21):**  You have to build up pressure starting from below because it's not going to come from  
**[0:35:25-0:35:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:35:25):**  above.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:35:26):**  The billionaires of the world are not going to rectify this.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:35:30):**  It's going to have to come from below and grow gradually over time.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:35:35):**  And the more we can push it, the better.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:35:38):**  Well, there is a place where billionaires could be helpful.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:35:42):**  And that is if they want to fund the research stations, which would include economics and  
**[0:35:47-0:35:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:35:47):**  sociological and political research as well.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:35:50):**  If a billionaire or two wants to do that, I'm all for it.  
**[0:35:53-0:35:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:35:53):**  Hear, hear.  
**[0:35:54-0:35:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:35:54):**  I agree.  
**[0:35:55-0:36:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:35:55):**  Now, one of the other things that I really got out of the article was some of the hard  
**[0:36:01-0:36:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:36:01):**  numbers that helped to illustrate the potential of this switch.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:36:04):**  I really gravitated towards the statistic of the idea that on simply one hectare of  
**[0:36:12-0:36:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:36:12):**  perennial production of walnuts, which frankly is the only way to produce them, at even just  
**[0:36:17-0:36:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:36:17):**  current production levels, not even with the improvements that are outlined in other parts  
**[0:36:21-0:36:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:36:21):**  of the article, that alone could supply up to 10% of a 2,000 calorie daily diet for up  
**[0:36:28-0:36:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:36:28):**  to 47,000 people.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:36:30):**  That's just one example.  
**[0:36:31-0:36:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:36:31):**  And this isn't just evidence for the potential to feed a large amount of people, but this  
**[0:36:36-0:36:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:36:36):**  being a protein and very healthy fat rich product can also help to wean people off of  
**[0:36:43-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:36:43):**  the destructive practices of the meat industry while potentially promoting the integration  
**[0:36:49-0:36:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:36:49):**  of cattle and other species and increasing the biodiversity in that same amount of land.  
**[0:36:56-0:37:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:36:56):**  Do you have any other examples that perhaps weren't outlined in the article that you could  
**[0:37:00-0:37:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:37:00):**  point to for that potential?  
**[0:37:02-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:37:02):**  Pecans, pecan trees, which don't go too well where I am, although they might with global  
**[0:37:07-0:37:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:37:07):**  warming, they offer a great many advantages in that they tend to have a loose open canopy.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:37:15):**  They produce a wonderful crop.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:37:17):**  They're beautiful trees and the understory that can be grown under them because of the  
**[0:37:21-0:37:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:37:21):**  open canopy allows you to put all sorts of other things underneath them.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:37:28):**  So that's one example.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:37:30):**  Mesquite, something which goes well out in the West, was providing food for Native Americans  
**[0:37:37-0:37:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:37:37):**  for generations before the Europeans ever arrived.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:37:40):**  And that could be used.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:37:42):**  The list is endless.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:37:46):**  We also published a review some years after the article that you've been discussing, which  
**[0:37:52-0:37:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:37:52):**  has some of these outlined in it.  
**[0:37:55-0:37:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:37:55):**  I should probably get you a copy of that sometime.  
**[0:37:57-0:38:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:37:57):**  Yeah, I would love to see it if you could send one over.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:38:01):**  I'll do that once we're off the air here.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:38:03):**  Sure, sure.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:38:04):**  So other things that I've been thinking of doing for various reasons, I haven't been  
**[0:38:11-0:38:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:38:11):**  writing as much recently, excuse me, as I did when I did that article, but I'm getting  
**[0:38:15-0:38:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:38:15):**  back to it now.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:38:17):**  I've been thinking of going back to doing exactly as you described and writing up more  
**[0:38:21-0:38:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:38:21):**  specific cases in the sense of a case report.  
**[0:38:25-0:38:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:38:25):**  If you read the medical literature, there are journals in which a physician or a researcher  
**[0:38:32-0:38:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:38:32):**  comes upon an interesting case or two, not enough to make an epidemiological argument,  
**[0:38:37-0:38:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:38:37):**  but interesting enough to publish it in order that somebody might pick it up and then make  
**[0:38:44-0:38:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:38:44):**  a further research project out of it.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:38:47):**  So coming up with agricultural case reports might be really useful.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:38:51):**  I've been thinking about doing exactly that.  
**[0:38:56-0:39:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:38:56):**  As I was doing research for not only this series on perennial and reforestation types  
**[0:39:01-0:39:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:39:01):**  of agriculture, I struggled to find a whole lot of articles advocating specifically for  
**[0:39:10-0:39:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:39:10):**  perennial agricultural shifts.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:39:12):**  I found a lot of material sort of talking about the potential and what could be discovered  
**[0:39:18-0:39:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:39:18):**  if we did more research, but really this was one of the only ones that I found that really  
**[0:39:23-0:39:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:39:23):**  gave a tangible outline for the steps that could be made to start to implement this on  
**[0:39:28-0:39:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:39:28):**  a global scale.  
**[0:39:30-0:39:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:39:30):**  And so my question is, being much more involved in academia than I am, do you see this as  
**[0:39:36-0:39:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:39:36):**  something of an increasing priority for research within academic circles?  
**[0:39:42-0:39:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:39:42):**  Or this still pretty new and only just now starting to come to the forefront of research?  
**[0:39:49-0:39:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:39:49):**  Academic circles, particularly schools of agriculture, have been somewhat involved in  
**[0:39:54-0:39:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:39:54):**  this but not nearly as much as one would like.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:39:59):**  Obviously schools of agriculture are functioning as branches of the U.S. Department of Agriculture  
**[0:40:07-0:40:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:40:07):**  through the land grant system of county agents, and these in turn are largely working along  
**[0:40:16-0:40:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:40:16):**  the lines that agribusiness has developed.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:40:19):**  There are exceptions here and there.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:40:21):**  There are quite a few exceptions here and there, but it's not nearly enough.  
**[0:40:27-0:40:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:40:27):**  academia has not really jumped into this.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:40:29):**  And I think one of the reasons is that the overlap between the agricultural problem and  
**[0:40:34-0:40:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:40:34):**  the political problems and the economic problems, including hierarchical structures of almost  
**[0:40:41-0:40:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:40:41):**  everything, including universities, makes it hard for people to do that and get the  
**[0:40:47-0:40:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:40:47):**  funding to make it happen.  
**[0:40:49-0:40:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:40:49):**  Yeah, much like you mentioned earlier, we're not even at the point where we're on a level  
**[0:40:55-0:41:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:40:55):**  playing field with people who are looking to implement this on a larger scale.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:41:00):**  Right now, all of the subsidies are for everything that would perpetuate the destructive cycle.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:41:06):**  Do you see much hope for sort of short term, say someone listening to this now is interested  
**[0:41:11-0:41:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:41:11):**  in implementing perennial agricultural systems, integrated permaculture based and polyculture  
**[0:41:18-0:41:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:41:18):**  small farms?  
**[0:41:20-0:41:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:41:20):**  Are there any institutional supports or academic resources that could help them take a few  
**[0:41:26-0:41:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:41:26):**  steps forward?  
**[0:41:28-0:41:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:41:28):**  Or is it really just a matter of swimming against the current?  
**[0:41:31-0:41:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:41:31):**  It's swimming against the current, but you can take the lead from people like Mark Shepherd  
**[0:41:35-0:41:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:41:35):**  or Wendell Berry, read up, and then start talking to local people where you are.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:41:41):**  You need to have an intellectual framework in your head, right, an outline in your mind  
**[0:41:46-0:41:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:41:46):**  as to help what you want to do.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:41:49):**  And you can get lots of details from the work of these writers and others who are out there.  
**[0:41:55-0:41:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:41:55):**  Another one is Wes Jackson at the Land Institute.  
**[0:41:58-0:42:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:41:58):**  His books are wonderful, and they provide a kind of a primer as to what sorts of things  
**[0:42:04-0:42:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:42:04):**  could be done.  
**[0:42:05-0:42:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:42:05):**  So if someone wants to get into this, they have some reading to do, some thinking to  
**[0:42:10-0:42:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:42:10):**  do, and then start talking to people, then they can make it happen.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:42:15):**  Certainly.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:42:16):**  Now, before I let you go, can you let our listeners know of any other resources that  
**[0:42:21-0:42:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:42:21):**  you're aware of, of where they could do more of this reading and investigation like you  
**[0:42:24-0:42:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:42:24):**  just mentioned, in order to better educate themselves on the potential of making a living  
**[0:42:30-0:42:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:42:30):**  and helping to advance the implementation of perennial and integrated agricultural systems?  
**[0:42:37-0:42:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:42:37):**  Well, I did mention the book by Mark Shepherd and a couple by Wendell Berry.  
**[0:42:42-0:42:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:42:42):**  And I mentioned some books from the Land Institute by Wes Jackson.  
**[0:42:47-0:42:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:42:47):**  Those are really good places to start.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:42:49):**  Those are about the best ones that I know of.  
**[0:42:51-0:42:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:42:51):**  There are undoubtedly things out there that I don't know of, because I've only gotten  
**[0:42:57-0:43:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:42:57):**  into this as a kind of sideline in addition to the biochemistry teaching and research  
**[0:43:03-0:43:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:43:03):**  that I do normally.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:43:05):**  And this is increasingly taking over my life.  
**[0:43:09-0:43:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:43:09):**  I'm actually here on the website for the Land Institute.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:43:12):**  I've got their page on perennial sorghum right now, and I'm going to start reading through  
**[0:43:17-0:43:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:43:17):**  this as soon as we get off the call.  
**[0:43:20-0:43:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:43:20):**  Sure.  
**[0:43:21-0:43:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:43:21):**  If you go on to Google and you put in permaculture or restoration agriculture and all kinds of  
**[0:43:26-0:43:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:43:26):**  things like that, everything in the world is going to pop up.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:43:30):**  Certainly.  
**[0:43:31-0:43:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:43:31):**  There's a ton of resources out there, many of which I've outlined in the podcast before.  
**[0:43:35-0:43:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:43:35):**  For people looking for more information, especially on agroforestry and perennial agriculture,  
**[0:43:40-0:43:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:43:40):**  you can look through this series that is ongoing.  
**[0:43:43-0:43:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:43:43):**  This is just one of the episodes in the last about six weeks that I've done of interviews  
**[0:43:47-0:43:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:43:47):**  focusing on this topic.  
**[0:43:49-0:43:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:43:49):**  So Peter, it's been absolutely wonderful talking to you.  
**[0:43:52-0:43:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:43:52):**  I really appreciate the perspective from the academic world on where this is going.  
**[0:43:56-0:44:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:43:56):**  And I really, really got a lot out of that article that you and your team put together,  
**[0:44:01-0:44:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:44:01):**  especially on the practical steps, even though they're beyond my personal reach.  
**[0:44:05-0:44:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:44:05):**  And involve many larger players on an international basis to get this moving.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:44:10):**  It gives me a lot of hope to see that people are putting real research and planning into  
**[0:44:14-0:44:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:44:14):**  what it would take to make this happen.  
**[0:44:16-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:44:16):**  So I really appreciate you taking the time today.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:44:19):**  Please let me know if you find anything more in your research.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:44:23):**  And as you continue to publish articles on this topic, I would love to do a follow up  
**[0:44:26-0:44:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:44:26):**  in the future.  
**[0:44:27-0:44:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:44:27):**  I'll certainly send you the review that we published a few years ago.  
**[0:44:31-0:44:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:44:31):**  Marvelous.  
**[0:44:32-0:44:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:44:32):**  All right.  
**[0:44:33-0:44:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:44:33):**  Well, thank you so much.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:44:34):**  I hope you get a chance to catch up again soon.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:44:35):**  You take care.  
**[0:44:36-0:44:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:44:36):**  I hope so.  
**[0:44:39-0:44:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:44:39):**  All right.  
**[0:44:40-0:44:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:44:40):**  That wraps things up for this week's episode.  
**[0:44:42-0:44:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:44:42):**  If you enjoyed this interview and want to find more like it, as well as articles and  
**[0:44:46-0:44:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:44:46):**  other resources, you can find the full library of previous podcasts at abundantedge.com.  
**[0:44:52-0:44:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:44:52):**  The best part is that you can search by topic rather than wading through more than 100 interviews  
**[0:44:56-0:45:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:44:56):**  by typing in any keyword or topic that you're looking for in the search function on the  
**[0:45:00-0:45:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:45:00):**  podcast page.  
**[0:45:02-0:45:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:45:02):**  I've spoken to experts on everything from growing your own food, building homes from  
**[0:45:06-0:45:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:45:06):**  natural materials to beekeeping, vermicompost, permaculture design philosophy, and so much  
**[0:45:11-0:45:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:45:11):**  more.  
**[0:45:13-0:45:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:45:13):**  Thank you so much to those of you who've taken the time to reach out via comments and emails.  
**[0:45:17-0:45:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:45:17):**  Your contributions helped me to make this the conversation that it's intended to be  
**[0:45:21-0:45:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:45:21):**  and helps me create more of the content around the topics that you're interested in.  
**[0:45:26-0:45:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:45:26):**  If you have any insights, advice, questions, or suggestions, be sure to send them to me  
**[0:45:30-0:45:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:45:30):**  at info at abundantedge.com and I'll look forward to being in touch.  
**[0:45:34-0:46:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-kahn/#t=0:45:34):**  New episodes come out every Friday like clockwork, so I'll catch you on next week's show.

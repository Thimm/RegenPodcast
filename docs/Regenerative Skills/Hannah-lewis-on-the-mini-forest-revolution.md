### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 24 Jun 2022 06:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:00:00):**  This is Regenerative Skills, the podcast helping you to learn the skills and solutions to create  
**[0:00:08-0:00:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:00:08):**  an abundant and connected future.  
**[0:00:10-0:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:00:10):**  I'm your host, Oliver Gaucher.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:00:13):**  I don't know about you, but even though there's unlimited information available online, I  
**[0:00:19-0:00:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:00:19):**  tend to learn best by doing things and actually getting my hands dirty.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:00:23):**  If you're interested in making the leap from screens to the land, then I've got some exciting  
**[0:00:27-0:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:00:27):**  learning events for you.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:00:29):**  I'm going to be teaching two of my favorite subjects this upcoming autumn at the Green  
**[0:00:33-0:00:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:00:33):**  Rebel Farm in beautiful Miravet, Spain.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:00:36):**  The first course is a weekend intensive on regenerative agroforestry, designed for people  
**[0:00:41-0:00:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:00:41):**  who want to try their hands at a range of different tree planting and orchard maintenance  
**[0:00:45-0:00:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:00:45):**  skills.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:00:46):**  We'll cover the whole range from reading a landscape and propagating plants, to planning  
**[0:00:50-0:00:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:00:50):**  a planting project, getting trees in the ground, maintaining a growing system, and even pruning  
**[0:00:55-0:00:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:00:55):**  a grown forest.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:00:56):**  The best part is that all of these are based on activities to advance a real farm.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:01:01):**  The second event is a 5-day deep dive into the regenerative design process, again with  
**[0:01:06-0:01:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:01:06):**  a focus on agroforestry.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:01:08):**  This course is designed for people who are either considering buying land, or who are  
**[0:01:12-0:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:01:12):**  at the early stages of developing a site and want to ensure that they get off on a profitable  
**[0:01:16-0:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:01:16):**  regenerative trajectory.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:01:18):**  We'll work through the scale of permanence, learning to gather essential information about  
**[0:01:22-0:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:01:22):**  the landscape, vegetation, and soil.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:01:25):**  From there, we'll work through hydrological capture and restoration, planning for productive  
**[0:01:30-0:01:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:01:30):**  planting and reforestation, business considerations, soil health regeneration, and much more.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:01:36):**  All of this too will be taught through hands-on activities so you leave not only knowing how  
**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:01:40):**  to develop an effective and profitable design, but also with experience with the work and  
**[0:01:45-0:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:01:45):**  skills required to get things done.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:01:48):**  This weekend agroforestry intensive will be from Friday the 16th through Sunday the 18th  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:01:52):**  of September, and the design workshop goes from Tuesday the 11th to Sunday the 16th of  
**[0:01:57-0:01:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:01:57):**  October.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:01:58):**  So don't start your project with digital learning alone, come and get your hands dirty  
**[0:02:02-0:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:02:02):**  with inspiring, like-minded people and level up your skills this autumn.

**[0:02:11-0:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:02:11):**  in the bio on our Instagram.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:02:13):**  Early bird discounts are now open, so don't hesitate, and I'll see you in the orchard  
**[0:02:17-0:02:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:02:17):**  soon!  
**[0:02:18-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:02:18):**  Hey everybody and welcome back to this ongoing series on tree planting and agroforestry.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:02:24):**  As I've been researching this topic for years, I've begun to see a spectrum of tree  
**[0:02:28-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:02:28):**  planting concepts that look like a gradient based on the diversity in the system.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:02:33):**  On one extreme you have monoculture orchards and timber plantations, which are really just  
**[0:02:37-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:02:37):**  a single species on very large tracts of land, and on the other extreme you have syntropic  
**[0:02:42-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:02:42):**  agroforestry for productive systems, and then what are known as Miyawaki forests for native  
**[0:02:47-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:02:47):**  restoration initiatives.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:02:49):**  And in both cases, these are very densely planted areas of tens or even hundreds of  
**[0:02:55-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:02:55):**  different species.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:02:56):**  In both cases, the idea is to accelerate the succession and maturation of the system by  
**[0:03:01-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:03:01):**  leveraging the diversity of plant communities to mimic natural forests to promote growth  
**[0:03:07-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:03:07):**  and resilience in the whole plantation.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:03:10):**  In today's episode, we're going to take a deep dive into the world of Miyawaki forests  
**[0:03:14-0:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:03:14):**  with Hannah Lewis, the author of the new book, Mini-Forest Revolution.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:03:18):**  Hannah Lewis is a writer focusing on people, nature, and conservation.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:03:22):**  She edits The Compendium of Scientific and Practical Finding Supporting Restoration to  
**[0:03:27-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:03:27):**  Address Global Warming, published by Biodiversity for a Livable Climate, an environmental nonprofit  
**[0:03:33-0:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:03:33):**  based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:03:35):**  Now Hannah was born and raised in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and she discovered the Miyawaki  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:03:39):**  method and wrote Mini-Forest Revolution while living with her partner and two children in  
**[0:03:44-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:03:44):**  France.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:03:45):**  In this episode, we're going to get into the history of Akira Miyawaki, the visionary  
**[0:03:49-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:03:49):**  scientist and ecologist behind the tree planting method named after him.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:03:53):**  We'll also break down the details of what makes this way of planting native forests  
**[0:03:57-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:03:57):**  so effective and revolutionary, from the deep research required to creating a planting list,  
**[0:04:03-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:04:03):**  how to prepare the ground to ensure that the trees get off to a healthy start, how to maintain  
**[0:04:07-0:04:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:04:07):**  the planted area as it gets established, and a whole lot more.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:04:11):**  We're also going to explore the powerful community building potential of getting people together  
**[0:04:15-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:04:15):**  to replant degraded areas, so make sure to listen all the way to the end where Hannah  
**[0:04:19-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:04:19):**  gives her advice on how to start a Miyawaki forest for yourself.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:04:23):**  And so now I'll hand things over to Hannah Lewis.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:04:28):**  Well Hannah, look, I'm really excited about this book because I have been interested in  
**[0:04:32-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:04:32):**  Tiny Forest, Miyawaki Forest for a while, especially once I first had that interview  
**[0:04:37-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:04:37):**  with Shubendu Sharma a couple of seasons ago.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:04:41):**  And I'm wondering how you first came to interact with and learn about Miyawaki Forest.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:04:47):**  Yeah, I was living in France and I was working remotely for a Boston-based organization called  
**[0:04:57-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:04:57):**  Biodiversity for a Livable Climate.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:05:00):**  And so reading and writing a lot about the importance of ecosystems for regulating water  
**[0:05:06-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:05:06):**  cycles, carbon cycles, nutrient cycles, and cooling the land.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:05:13):**  And so thinking a lot about these topics and kind of itching to get out there and do something  
**[0:05:21-0:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:05:21):**  that actually made a difference on the land.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:05:25):**  And so I was really primed for the Miyawaki method when an article came across my screen  
**[0:05:32-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:05:32):**  about a project in Nantes, which is not too far from where I was living in France, where  
**[0:05:40-0:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:05:40):**  a couple had planted a small 200 square foot square meter, native dense native forest next  
**[0:05:52-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:05:52):**  to a road that was about to be expanded.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:05:58):**  And it just struck me right away because I thought, wow, that's cool that they're actually  
**[0:06:02-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:06:02):**  planting a native forest.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:06:03):**  I mean, I hadn't heard about people doing that.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:06:06):**  And then they're doing it on a small scale, which means that they, you know, one couple  
**[0:06:12-0:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:06:12):**  working with a team of volunteers can do something like that.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:06:16):**  That's really meaningful.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:06:18):**  And yeah, so that's how I came across it.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:06:24):**  And I never looked back.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:06:27):**  So since that first planting event, you have researched many different configurations and  
**[0:06:34-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:06:34):**  the origins of how this method was first developed.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:06:37):**  Can you talk about who Akira Miyawaki was and how he came to develop his method of forestry?  
**[0:06:44-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:06:44):**  Yeah.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:06:45):**  Well, he was born in, I think, 1928 in Japan.  
**[0:06:54-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:06:54):**  He became, he was the son of a farming family and he got into studying biology and plant  
**[0:07:03-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:07:03):**  biology.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:07:04):**  And so eventually finished a doctorate in weed.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:07:11):**  He studied weed ecology and weed morphology.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:07:16):**  And so he was pretty interested in weeds, but not, the general society is not terribly  
**[0:07:21-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:07:21):**  interested in weeds.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:07:23):**  But he had been noticed in Germany by Reinhold Tuckson, who was studying potential natural  
**[0:07:33-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:07:33):**  vegetation.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:07:35):**  And Tuckson invited him to come study with him.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:07:39):**  So basically that launched Miyawaki on a kind of a lifelong journey to do vegetation mapping  
**[0:07:49-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:07:49):**  and to find out what plants are growing together and how that relates to the climate and to  
**[0:07:57-0:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:07:57):**  the soil and the topography.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:07:59):**  And so he came back to Japan and he started doing vegetation mapping there and thinking  
**[0:08:06-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:08:06):**  about, well, what is the potential of natural vegetation?  
**[0:08:10-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:08:10):**  In other words, what plant community would be growing in any one site if humans, if we  
**[0:08:18-0:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:08:18):**  hadn't cut forests or cut down the vegetation for development for cities, for agriculture?  
**[0:08:28-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:08:28):**  And that's kind of tricky to figure out because the land is so transformed in Japan and Europe  
**[0:08:34-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:08:34):**  and the US and many parts of the world that knowing what vegetation would be growing there  
**[0:08:42-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:08:42):**  is tricky.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:08:43):**  So he set about to figure that out and discovered that the sacred forests, there were sacred  
**[0:08:49-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:08:49):**  forests associated with Shinto shrines.  
**[0:08:53-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:08:53):**  And they had a very distinct vegetation, very, very old oak trees and laurel trees.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:09:03):**  And it was different than the vegetation he saw around him in sort of urban areas and  
**[0:09:10-0:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:09:10):**  discovered that that was the original vegetation and the other vegetation was secondary or  
**[0:09:15-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:09:15):**  planted vegetation.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:09:18):**  Once he knew that, he thought this vegetation is durable, it's ecological function.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:09:25):**  How can we reestablish this vegetation?  
**[0:09:28-0:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:09:28):**  And this is so important because we humans depend on healthy ecosystems for air, for  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:09:34):**  clean water, for even for a milder climate, we depend on healthy ecosystems.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:09:39):**  So that launched him on his journey, which he continued until the last moments that he  
**[0:09:47-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:09:47):**  possibly could.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:09:49):**  I have one quote I would like to read from him.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:09:53):**  Yeah, please do.  
**[0:09:54-0:10:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:09:54):**  It describes his vision and his engagement in the world, which, so he says, let us go  
**[0:10:03-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:10:03):**  out and create real forests based on potential natural vegetation, not waiting for tomorrow,  
**[0:10:10-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:10:10):**  but starting now from where we are standing and spreading outward to the whole world.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:10:15):**  I myself am resolved to continue to plant trees based on potential natural vegetation  
**[0:10:21-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:10:21):**  together with you all, starting from where I stand and spreading out to the whole world  
**[0:10:26-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:10:26):**  so long as I have life left in my body.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:10:29):**  And he was really true to that, to that kind of vision and statement.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:10:34):**  Wow, that is a really powerful drive for a person's life.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:10:40):**  Now can you help to explain what the Milwaukee method is?  
**[0:10:45-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:10:45):**  That lineage and that understanding that he built up has come into a process that helps  
**[0:10:50-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:10:50):**  to grow forests at an accelerated rate and at just about any size scale.  
**[0:10:56-0:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:10:56):**  Can you break down those steps for me?  
**[0:10:58-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:10:58):**  Sure.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:10:59):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:11:00):**  So his goal, as I mentioned before, was to recreate the potential natural vegetation.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:11:06):**  And so to do that, he took a look at the process of ecological succession, whereby you have,  
**[0:11:15-0:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:11:15):**  when you start with bare ground degraded land, which we see all around us, the first plants  
**[0:11:21-0:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:11:21):**  to colonize that land are small, annual, short-lived plants that grow quickly and then die.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:11:30):**  But as they're growing, they're improving the soil a teeny tiny bit, adding organic  
**[0:11:34-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:11:34):**  material, cooling it down a tiny bit, decompacting it.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:11:38):**  And then they're succeeded by slightly larger vegetation, slightly longer lived.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:11:46):**  And this process continues through successive waves of vegetation where it's increasingly  
**[0:11:52-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:11:52):**  longer lived and larger until finally you have a community, a climax community of, and  
**[0:12:05-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:12:05):**  in the case where the potential natural vegetation is forest, the climax community is a forest  
**[0:12:13-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:12:13):**  of trees that are shade tolerant.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:12:16):**  So they can grow up in an understory and then replace the older trees that have died.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:12:29):**  But all the vegetation leading up to that point do need sun.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:12:35):**  And so they cannot then enter that forest community because they can't germinate and  
**[0:12:42-0:12:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:12:42):**  grow up in the shade.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:12:43):**  So in that sense, you've created a community that's going to perpetuate itself through  
**[0:12:49-0:12:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:12:49):**  time and be stable.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:12:52):**  And so what he did was he looked at what those species are in that climax community.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:12:59):**  Let's plant them directly.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:13:00):**  But since we're starting with degraded soil, we need to do the work that all of those earlier  
**[0:13:05-0:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:13:05):**  successional species have done to improve the soil.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:13:09):**  We need to loosen it, decompact it, add organic material, topsoil.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:13:15):**  And so let's let us do that ourselves.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:13:17):**  So the first step is improving, decompacting the soil, adding organic material up.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:13:24):**  He suggested 20 to 30 centimeters of topsoil should be reestablished.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:13:30):**  And then plant a mixture of what would be growing in that climax community, the climax  
**[0:13:35-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:13:35):**  community, the canopy trees, the midsize trees and the shrubs.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:13:39):**  So you have a multi-layer natural forest.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:13:44):**  And then they're basically primed to do well because you've created the ideal conditions.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:13:50):**  You've improved the soil and you planted the mix of species that you know grows well in  
**[0:13:58-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:13:58):**  that environment.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:13:59):**  And so they grow.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:14:01):**  So you plant them and then you mulch it.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:14:03):**  You mulch the ground to protect the soil while the plants are still really young.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:14:08):**  And eventually after three years, they've created enough shade to protect the soil,  
**[0:14:14-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:14:14):**  create a microclimate inside that little forest that shades out any other weed species and  
**[0:14:27-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:14:27):**  protects the soil.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:14:28):**  And then it's self-sufficient after three years.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:14:31):**  So no maintenance is ever needed after that point if you've actually created a self-sustaining  
**[0:14:37-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:14:37):**  ecosystem.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:14:38):**  Yeah, that's phenomenal.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:14:40):**  That's really innovative, especially for the time.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:14:43):**  And I've learned quite a bit about the succession of forest.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:14:46):**  Can you talk about the different strata and the levels that are needing to be considered  
**[0:14:51-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:14:51):**  when you're selecting your plants?  
**[0:14:53-0:14:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:14:53):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:54-0:15:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:14:54):**  So it's mainly the most important part is the canopy trees.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:15:00):**  And he talks about the main forest species.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:15:03):**  So in the forests of Japan where he was working in southern Japan, mainly it was oaks, evergreen  
**[0:15:15-0:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:15:15):**  oaks and laurel species.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:15:18):**  And those were, he called them the forest leaders because they kind of created the structure  
**[0:15:23-0:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:15:23):**  of the forest and they were sort of the foundational species.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:15:31):**  But then you're also planting shrubs and mid-size species that would naturally grow in that  
**[0:15:38-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:15:38):**  community.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:15:41):**  And then you're planting them densely so that you're encouraging interaction among all the  
**[0:15:46-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:15:46):**  species.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:15:47):**  So the density is like sort of typically three plants per square meter, which is really,  
**[0:15:56-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:15:56):**  really dense compared to other plantings.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:15:59):**  But the cool thing is that you're using the vertical space too.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:16:03):**  So you're not only planting trees, which would be pretty crowded, but you're filling the  
**[0:16:10-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:16:10):**  space in just below the canopy level and then just below that in the shrub level.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:16:17):**  And then there's other species.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:16:19):**  There's like herbaceous species that belong in the forest too.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:16:24):**  You don't necessarily need to plant those if there's enough seed stock around in the  
**[0:16:30-0:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:16:30):**  city where you're planting because those can be brought in by the wind or by animals.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:16:34):**  So you just want to cover the main ones that wouldn't necessarily establish there if you  
**[0:16:40-0:16:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:16:40):**  didn't do it.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:16:41):**  Sure, and when it comes to amending the soil in order to get it ready for planting this  
**[0:16:48-0:16:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:16:48):**  diversity of species, does it matter a whole lot what the subsoil or the soil profile is  
**[0:16:54-0:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:16:54):**  when you get started?  
**[0:16:55-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:16:55):**  Or is it just a matter of decompaction and putting on enough organic matter that it mimics  
**[0:17:00-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:17:00):**  what a forest would do?  
**[0:17:05-0:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:17:05):**  You definitely have to see what the subsoil is and part of that helps you figure out what  
**[0:17:15-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:17:15):**  the potential natural vegetation would be because that depends on the soil type and  
**[0:17:22-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:17:22):**  the topography and the climate.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:17:25):**  But for instance, in some cases, these forests were planted on reclaimed land from the sea.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:17:34):**  And so that's really kind of wet.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:17:41):**  And so what what Miyawaki did to deal with that was to make really giant mounds.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:17:47):**  And so then it really was creating the conditions yourself and just making sure that there's  
**[0:17:56-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:17:56):**  good drainage and that there's enough organic material and that the climate is right.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:18:02):**  So you can compensate for different soils like that.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:18:09):**  But the soils again, I mean, it's important to do an analysis of the soils at the beginning  
**[0:18:13-0:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:18:13):**  to help you figure out what the proper species mix would be.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:18:18):**  Yeah, that makes a lot of sense and adapting it to whatever other conditions that you're  
**[0:18:22-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:18:22):**  in.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:18:23):**  But that kind of comes along with the initial selection of the tree species to begin with.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:18:28):**  And you mentioned how Miyawaki came up with a challenge of trying to figure out what the  
**[0:18:33-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:18:33):**  configuration of a native forest in an urban area might be.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:18:38):**  How do you go about doing that sort of investigation if you don't have a broad knowledge of plants  
**[0:18:44-0:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:18:44):**  to begin with or perhaps need to go into the history to be able to find accurate information  
**[0:18:49-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:18:49):**  for your area?  
**[0:18:51-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:18:51):**  Yeah, it's definitely a research project.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:18:54):**  It's really it really is.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:18:57):**  And in in the part of France where I was living, that has been agriculture.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:19:04):**  Historical records show that it was forests several thousand years ago, but it has been  
**[0:19:09-0:19:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:19:09):**  agriculture for centuries.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:19:12):**  And so there was one forest in the area, but it was a planted forest.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:19:18):**  And so there were trees from California and all over that were planted in there.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:19:24):**  And so it was kind of complicated to figure out what what would be the native forest community  
**[0:19:33-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:19:33):**  to plant.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:19:35):**  So the thing that's important, I think, for me, I'm not a forest ecologist.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:19:41):**  I have a background in environmental studies and sustainable agriculture, but this was  
**[0:19:46-0:19:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:19:46):**  a new exploration for me.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:19:51):**  And as it was for a lot of the people who have who have adopted the Milwaukee method,  
**[0:19:57-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:19:57):**  there's you interviewed Shubendu Sharma.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:19:59):**  He was an engineer.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:20:02):**  Other people have been, you know, come from business administration or I.T. or, you know,  
**[0:20:09-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:20:09):**  so and so the process, you know, and Milwaukee says you don't need to be a botanist to lead  
**[0:20:17-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:20:17):**  a project like this.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:20:18):**  You just need to be really dedicated to doing it right and doing it well and not cutting  
**[0:20:24-0:20:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:20:24):**  corners.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:20:25):**  And so so so what what what I did in that situation was I reached out to the local forest  
**[0:20:37-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:20:37):**  department person to to ask.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:20:39):**  I came up with a list based on based on the botanical concern, National Botanical Conservatory  
**[0:20:48-0:20:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:20:48):**  had made a list of native species of that area.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:20:52):**  So I, I took that list and I pulled out all the all the native woody like forest species.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:20:58):**  I put them all down and then I shared it with the local forest forest ranger.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:21:04):**  He said, don't don't plant that one.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:21:07):**  That's not going to go really close to the coast or don't plant this one.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:21:11):**  We've only found it really in the southern part of this area.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:21:14):**  So he he helped me hone it down.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:21:16):**  Then I moved to the back to the Botanical Conservatory and and she actually helped me  
**[0:21:24-0:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:21:24):**  look at exactly at the site where I was planting.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:21:27):**  And there had been a study of forest growing into in in sites like that on the coast.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:21:34):**  And she said, so this study would your your site would match this kind of forest community  
**[0:21:41-0:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:21:41):**  described in the study.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:21:43):**  And so you can find all the species listed here.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:21:46):**  So then I was able to trim down my original list even more based on based on that study.  
**[0:21:54-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:21:54):**  So it's it's basically finding finding the right people to advise you.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:22:01):**  And that's key. That's really, really important.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:22:05):**  And and then digging in every direction to figure out.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:22:09):**  Yeah, whether it's scientific material or historical material that talks about the vegetation.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:22:17):**  So it's it's a research project and it definitely requires dedication and persistence.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:22:22):**  Yeah, but the good news is it's pretty fun.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:22:25):**  I've been doing that myself for where I am.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:22:27):**  I've been able to connect with forestry technicians from the local national parks and people who  
**[0:22:34-0:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:22:34):**  run also big forestry nurseries for ideas and examples of what could work.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:22:41):**  And it's really expanded my own plant knowledge and understanding of the local ecology in  
**[0:22:47-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:22:47):**  the process, which has tons of extra benefits as well.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:22:51):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:22:52):**  Now we're talking about how the soil conditions might be a lot different if you live in an  
**[0:22:58-0:23:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:22:58):**  urban area or if the native forests have been taken away from agriculture or for timber  
**[0:23:04-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:23:04):**  plantings or whatnot.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:23:06):**  But there's also the question of, are we even in the same climactic conditions as to what  
**[0:23:12-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:23:12):**  the configuration of the forest that we're trying to plant would be able to support?  
**[0:23:16-0:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:23:16):**  I know in a lot of places not only have temperatures been rising, but rainfall patterns have changed  
**[0:23:24-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:23:24):**  a lot.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:23:25):**  Is it really a resilient solution to plant the native species when perhaps the conditions  
**[0:23:31-0:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:23:31):**  are not going to be conducive for them to thrive in 10, 15, 20 years?  
**[0:23:38-0:23:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:23:38):**  Well, Milwaukee definitely clearly said the potential natural vegetation is what would  
**[0:23:45-0:23:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:23:45):**  be growing in the current climate, in the current conditions.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:23:53):**  And so what we want to do is create local resilience.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:23:57):**  We want to create an ecosystem that's going to help mitigate climate change in its own  
**[0:24:05-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:24:05):**  tiny little way, but also help us mitigate local conditions right now, right really quickly,  
**[0:24:13-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:24:13):**  you know, establish wildlife habitat right now.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:24:16):**  And so I think if you're looking at a couple hundred years in the past for the species  
**[0:24:27-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:24:27):**  that were growing then, that's still going to be a good template, the best model that  
**[0:24:35-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:24:35):**  we have for what would be growing well now.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:24:41):**  But it's also important to take a look around exactly, you know, in the area on the site  
**[0:24:47-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:24:47):**  to see what is growing well.  
**[0:24:50-0:25:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:24:50):**  And I just yesterday I was talking to a forest ecologist from Minnesota where I am now.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:25:02):**  And he's observed that the counties in northern Minnesota have warmed faster than any other  
**[0:25:12-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:25:12):**  counties in the whole United States.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:25:15):**  And I think it's kind of consistent with the fact that the Arctic is warming faster than  
**[0:25:20-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:25:20):**  mid-latitudes.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:25:22):**  So already those areas of northern Minnesota have warmed two degrees, which is more than  
**[0:25:28-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:25:28):**  the global average.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:25:30):**  And what he's seen is that after a disturbance, that's boreal, that has been boreal, it's  
**[0:25:37-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:25:37):**  the edge of the boreal forest.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:25:39):**  And after windstorms and fire, where trees have come down, what is coming up now is actually  
**[0:25:47-0:25:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:25:47):**  maple, which is from the biome just below that edge of the boreal forest.  
**[0:25:52-0:26:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:25:52):**  And so in that kind of situation, if you were going to do a Miyawaki method there, I think  
**[0:26:00-0:26:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:26:00):**  that you would be considering those species that are growing well now, the maples, you  
**[0:26:06-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:26:06):**  would be thinking about a hardwood maple forest as opposed to a boreal, just on that edge  
**[0:26:11-0:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:26:11):**  there, where it started to shift.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:26:15):**  But that's not the case in many places that we're planting.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:26:19):**  And so I think the best idea and what I understand the Miyawaki method to say is that, yeah,  
**[0:26:29-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:26:29):**  we need to grow according to current conditions and what's going to do well right now, not  
**[0:26:35-0:26:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:26:35):**  anticipating how species will migrate in the future necessarily.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:26:40):**  Sure.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:26:41):**  I suppose one of the advantages of this is that because the forest could establish so  
**[0:26:44-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:26:44):**  quickly, if you do have to adapt, you have a much shorter runway to getting new species  
**[0:26:51-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:26:51):**  established if that's what's called for in the future.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:26:54):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:55-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:26:55):**  I think it also may help them migrate in the future.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:26:58):**  If you have a good stock of the species that are growing at this particular latitude in  
**[0:27:04-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:27:04):**  this particular climate, if you can bring them there in large numbers, in healthy numbers,  
**[0:27:10-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:27:10):**  then as the climate starts to change, the seed stock is there.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:27:15):**  And so it'll make it easier for them to migrate north.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:27:18):**  Sure.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:27:19):**  This will be interesting to see as people do this in more places around the world.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:27:24):**  So there are a lot of benefits to planting in this way.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:27:28):**  What are some of the main motivations that you've seen individuals in groups come towards  
**[0:27:33-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:27:33):**  these types of tiny forest projects hoping to achieve?  
**[0:27:38-0:27:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:27:38):**  Well connecting city people with nature, reestablishing that link because it's when you live in a  
**[0:27:45-0:27:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:27:45):**  really urban area, it's easy to forget that actually we're part of a larger web of species  
**[0:27:50-0:27:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:27:50):**  upon which we depend.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:27:52):**  And so it gives people an experience, like you were saying, it helps us learn the names  
**[0:27:59-0:28:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:27:59):**  of trees, of different plants, and it helps us learn what biome we're living in.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:28:08):**  And so it gives us really a bigger picture of the larger biological community that we're  
**[0:28:17-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:28:17):**  a part of.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:28:21):**  But I think also, you know, the people are really becoming very much aware of the climate  
**[0:28:32-0:28:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:28:32):**  crisis and the biodiversity crisis and how they're intertwined and how the Miu'aki method  
**[0:28:41-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:28:41):**  addresses both of those crises at the same time with really immediate results because  
**[0:28:48-0:28:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:28:48):**  these little forests can establish themselves pretty quickly.  
**[0:28:54-0:28:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:28:54):**  So right away you're creating habitat.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:28:58):**  And in the Netherlands, they planted a 200 square meter forest that within about five  
**[0:29:06-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:29:06):**  years they counted 500 species of plants and insects and small mammals and birds in that  
**[0:29:16-0:29:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:29:16):**  area.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:29:17):**  So before it had been grass.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:29:19):**  And so they really, you create results immediately.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:29:25):**  And also I think people are increasingly aware of the fact that trees help reduce the urban  
**[0:29:32-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:29:32):**  heat island effect.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:29:33):**  They can cool, create like really significant cooling effects in cities that are just getting  
**[0:29:41-0:29:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:29:41):**  hotter and hotter.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:29:44):**  And so if one tree can do have a cooling effect, imagine what 600 trees and shrubs can do in  
**[0:29:54-0:30:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:29:54):**  a small area, especially given that they're probably healthier because of that by virtue  
**[0:30:02-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:30:02):**  of growing in a community, a forest community.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:30:06):**  Sure.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:30:07):**  Now, no method is without a few disadvantages.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:30:12):**  And compared to other agroforestry plantings, what are some of the drawbacks to planting  
**[0:30:17-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:30:17):**  in a Mirawaki configuration?  
**[0:30:22-0:30:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:30:22):**  Well there's definitely a lot of upfront effort.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:30:26):**  Like you and I were talking about a bit ago, there's that it's knowledge intensive.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:30:31):**  You can't just kind of wing it.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:30:35):**  And so there's the learning curve, there's the effort it takes to figure out what's really  
**[0:30:47-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:30:47):**  going to work in terms of a species list.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:30:54):**  And then the soil prep is significant.  
**[0:30:56-0:31:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:30:56):**  Often we're just digging a hole in the ground and putting a tree in there.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:31:02):**  But in this case, we're using oftentimes using machines to loosen up the soil and then adding  
**[0:31:10-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:31:10):**  significant amounts of compost.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:31:12):**  So that's another additional effort.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:31:17):**  And then you're planting so densely.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:31:18):**  So you're actually with the same number of trees, you're covering a much smaller area.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:31:25):**  So you're not, yeah, it's hard to cover a large area with this method.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:31:31):**  So I would say those are the key drawbacks.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:31:37):**  And also just maybe the newness, like if you're a project leader and you're trying to get  
**[0:31:44-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:31:44):**  people to engage in this project, it's new and people may be skeptical.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:31:54):**  So there's that hurdle too, it's just kind of like experimenting with the method and  
**[0:31:59-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:31:59):**  saying, let's give it a try.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:32:02):**  And if it works, let's keep doing it.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:32:04):**  If it doesn't work, no harm done really.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:32:07):**  But.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:32:08):**  Sure.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:32:09):**  And have you found some ways to cut down on these initial costs and disadvantages?  
**[0:32:15-0:32:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:32:15):**  Are there some techniques that people have tried to make it a little easier or cheaper?  
**[0:32:21-0:32:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:32:21):**  Well, so yeah.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:32:23):**  So I guess another challenge is finding native species, finding all the species on your list.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:32:30):**  And for us, when we did it in France, there was only one nursery in the whole region that  
**[0:32:37-0:32:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:32:37):**  was carrying local tree species.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:32:44):**  And so we had to go three hours to get those.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:32:49):**  And if he hadn't been there, we wouldn't have been able to do the project.  
**[0:32:53-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:32:53):**  And so in Cameroon, Limbi Blessing Tata, who was the project leader there, she found a  
**[0:33:04-0:33:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:33:04):**  local nursery, but they only had a handful of local species that they were carrying.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:33:11):**  So their first few forests, they only planted, I don't know, 10 or so different species.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:33:18):**  And yet that area has just thousands of local species that could be planted.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:33:28):**  It's an incredibly rich area.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:33:30):**  So she decided with her organization to start their own nursery to say, well, it's expensive  
**[0:33:38-0:33:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:33:38):**  and we're also really limited in terms of species if we're relying on this local commercial  
**[0:33:42-0:33:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:33:42):**  nursery.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:33:44):**  So let's within our organization start our own nursery and it'll allow us to do projects,  
**[0:33:53-0:33:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:33:53):**  respond more quickly to requests because we have our own stock and we don't have to wait  
**[0:33:58-0:34:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:33:58):**  for a grant to go buy from a nursery.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:34:02):**  So yeah, and actually, Miwaki, that was his preference to begin with.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:34:10):**  He often in his projects, he had people like groups of school kids go and collect acorns  
**[0:34:16-0:34:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:34:16):**  from a local forest, plant them in their schools and grow the seed stock like that.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:34:23):**  So it's a really cool idea if you can organize that far in advance to collect the seed, to  
**[0:34:31-0:34:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:34:31):**  grow it, because then you're that much more knee deep in the whole process and engaged  
**[0:34:37-0:34:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:34:37):**  in the whole process and you're cutting costs too.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:34:40):**  Yeah, it just makes so much sense.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:34:43):**  And actually starting a tree nursery is one of the enterprises that I'm going to get started  
**[0:34:46-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:34:46):**  with once I move on to the new property as well.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:34:49):**  Partly because, I mean, fortunately there are areas and nurseries around here where  
**[0:34:54-0:34:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:34:54):**  you can get native tree material and seedlings as well.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:34:58):**  But there's a lot that you can learn from going through the process yourself and there's  
**[0:35:03-0:35:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:35:03):**  a lot of money to be saved as well if you start things from seed.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:35:08):**  Plus there's just the sheer joy of seeing something transform from a small little grain  
**[0:35:13-0:35:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:35:13):**  all the way into a large mammoth life form.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:35:18):**  This kind of brings it back to one of the most important elements both in the book and  
**[0:35:22-0:35:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:35:22):**  in this technique is that there's a huge potential for building community out of events like  
**[0:35:27-0:35:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:35:27):**  this.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:35:28):**  Can you talk about some of the examples that you have in your book and some of the inspirations  
**[0:35:33-0:35:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:35:33):**  that you've seen from these community efforts that were centered around planting projects?  
**[0:35:39-0:35:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:35:39):**  I could talk about Miyawaki and maybe I'll just mention that his planting efforts were  
**[0:35:47-0:35:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:35:47):**  always framed as planting festivals and they always involved hundreds or even thousands  
**[0:35:53-0:35:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:35:53):**  of people and every generation involved.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:35:57):**  So he set the standard, he set the tone for what people would then, I think what made  
**[0:36:03-0:36:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:36:03):**  people kind of fall in love with the method to begin with was that community engagement  
**[0:36:07-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:36:07):**  that he always prioritized.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:36:15):**  And so I think the example, I mean there's lots of examples.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:36:22):**  Maybe I'll just start with the Netherlands because their goal for their Tiny Forest Program  
**[0:36:30-0:36:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:36:30):**  is specifically to connect kids to nature.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:36:33):**  And so when they engage a city, so cities apply to be part of the program and then neighborhoods  
**[0:36:45-0:36:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:36:45):**  themselves have to propose a project.  
**[0:36:48-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:36:48):**  So if my city is going to be involved in a Tiny Forest Program, I from my neighborhood  
**[0:36:54-0:36:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:36:54):**  can get my neighbors together and say we want one in our park here and here's why and here's  
**[0:36:59-0:37:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:36:59):**  how we're going to support it, et cetera.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:37:02):**  And so it's actually the neighborhoods coming forward to say we want to do this.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:37:08):**  And then the organization, the Tiny Forest Program comes back and says, okay, well you  
**[0:37:13-0:37:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:37:13):**  also need to have a school participating.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:37:16):**  So every single Tiny Forest is going to be adopted by a school and it's going to be the  
**[0:37:21-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:37:21):**  kids from that school who planted it, the kids from that school who are going to be  
**[0:37:25-0:37:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:37:25):**  the rangers, meaning that they're going to kind of monitor it, make sure that there's  
**[0:37:29-0:37:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:37:29):**  no litter around.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:37:32):**  They're going to be the ones giving tours to their parents and to other community members  
**[0:37:37-0:37:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:37:37):**  to show them what this forest is, what the species are.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:37:40):**  So a real adoption.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:37:41):**  I mean they're the rangers, they're the caretakers of those forests and they're growing up.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:37:46):**  With the trees, the trees start smaller than them and are quickly taller than them, but  
**[0:37:51-0:37:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:37:51):**  they're growing up at the same time.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:37:58):**  So and then I'll go back to Cameroon again too where the first project they did, they  
**[0:38:13-0:38:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:38:13):**  engaged a large number of volunteers and planted, but they didn't do enough, quite enough community  
**[0:38:19-0:38:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:38:19):**  outreach and so there was some damage because people didn't know what it was all about and  
**[0:38:24-0:38:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:38:24):**  so they had to replant.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:38:26):**  And so then they, for the next project they did, they said, okay, this time we're going  
**[0:38:31-0:38:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:38:31):**  to do a lot of community engagement.  
**[0:38:33-0:38:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:38:33):**  And so lots of people, the leader of the community came and everybody was involved in the planting  
**[0:38:41-0:38:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:38:41):**  day and they really stressed what this is about.  
**[0:38:45-0:38:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:38:45):**  This is going to recharge the water table in this area so that we have, we can deal  
**[0:38:51-0:38:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:38:51):**  with our water crisis.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:38:52):**  This will help us with that, but we need to take care of the little plants when they're  
**[0:38:57-0:39:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:38:57):**  at a young age so make sure the kids are aware of that, etc.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:39:02):**  And that was key for making that project go just a little bit smoother than the first  
**[0:39:10-0:39:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:39:10):**  one where they hadn't done as much community engagement.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:39:12):**  So anyway, those are a couple examples, but maybe I'll just add one more where in Beirut  
**[0:39:20-0:39:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:39:20):**  when they planted, they had about 100 people involved in their first forest planting on  
**[0:39:27-0:39:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:39:27):**  the river, the Beirut River.  
**[0:39:30-0:39:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:39:30):**  They had to get off trash, they had to, there was a lot of steps to do that people, that  
**[0:39:37-0:39:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:39:37):**  volunteers could be engaged in, but when they were planting people just walking by came  
**[0:39:43-0:39:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:39:43):**  in and said, hey, can I plant one?  
**[0:39:45-0:39:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:39:45):**  That looks really cool.  
**[0:39:47-0:39:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:39:47):**  And it was like, it was cool to see people just kind of, I guess, come alive just by  
**[0:39:55-0:40:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:39:55):**  the fact of touching a tree, holding a plant, putting it in the ground, knowing that they  
**[0:40:00-0:40:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:40:00):**  had made that contribution.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:40:02):**  So it's pretty, I think it's pretty appealing to people.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:40:05):**  Oh, I could definitely see that.  
**[0:40:07-0:40:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:40:07):**  It's been my experience.  
**[0:40:08-0:40:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:40:08):**  I've been involved with quite a few planting events and projects at this point, and you're  
**[0:40:13-0:40:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:40:13):**  absolutely right.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:40:14):**  There's something inherent in people that just wants to be involved with touching the  
**[0:40:21-0:40:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:40:21):**  ground, regreening an area, being involved with the process of life and projects that  
**[0:40:27-0:40:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:40:27):**  have a trajectory for a better future and a healthier area.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:40:32):**  Especially, like you said too, with kids, I've seen that in a big way because they're  
**[0:40:37-0:40:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:40:37):**  often not given license to go out and dig and be involved alongside with adults, but  
**[0:40:45-0:40:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:40:45):**  they can be just as effective.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:40:46):**  They learn really quickly.  
**[0:40:47-0:40:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:40:47):**  And with the example you gave in the Netherlands of growing up with the forest and having ownership  
**[0:40:53-0:41:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:40:53):**  of it as well, I can only imagine what that does for their understanding of their capacity.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:41:02):**  The capacity to participate and actually have a beneficial relationship with their own environment  
**[0:41:07-0:41:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:41:07):**  rather than this more common narrative of the best that we can do is try and reduce  
**[0:41:11-0:41:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:41:11):**  our impact and consume less.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:41:14):**  And so we need to go back to one part about these systems that is really important to  
**[0:41:20-0:41:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:41:20):**  understand.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:41:21):**  And I think it's often not talked about enough, especially in planting projects, and that's  
**[0:41:25-0:41:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:41:25):**  the maintenance that is required to make sure that they succeed.  
**[0:41:29-0:41:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:41:29):**  And even though these forest configurations are mostly self-sustaining, the first three  
**[0:41:35-0:41:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:41:35):**  years is pretty crucial for them to get established and to become strong enough that they no longer  
**[0:41:40-0:41:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:41:40):**  really need much intervention.  
**[0:41:42-0:41:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:41:42):**  Can you give me an idea of what a maintenance plan looks like for one of these projects  
**[0:41:48-0:41:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:41:48):**  and what you should consider as far as perhaps budget or equipment or hours required to get  
**[0:41:56-0:41:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:41:56):**  it going?  
**[0:41:57-0:42:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:41:57):**  Yeah, I mean, I think it depends a bit on the climate.  
**[0:42:00-0:42:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:42:00):**  If it's a drier place like Southern California, you may need to do more watering at first.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:42:09):**  But the ones that I'm particularly familiar with were the ones in Europe where the maintenance  
**[0:42:18-0:42:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:42:18):**  was actually fairly limited.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:42:20):**  So in Paris, the city came by and watered the forest in its first few years just twice,  
**[0:42:32-0:42:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:42:32):**  just like once or twice in July, August, when things were getting really hot and dry.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:42:39):**  But that's all.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:42:40):**  It wasn't like a regular weekly thing or something like that.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:42:46):**  And then it's weeding.  
**[0:42:47-0:42:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:42:47):**  So if you've got a team of volunteers that are excited about the project and you weed  
**[0:42:53-0:42:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:42:53):**  a couple times, you pull up the weeds and then you just lay them right down on top of  
**[0:42:57-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:42:57):**  the mulch so that they add to the mulch.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:43:01):**  And you do that a few times during the summer or as needed.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:43:08):**  That's pretty much it.  
**[0:43:09-0:43:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:43:09):**  So it's actually, I think, at least in the European context, it's a pretty light hand  
**[0:43:17-0:43:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:43:17):**  that maintenance period.  
**[0:43:18-0:43:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:43:18):**  It's important, but it's not super involved.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:43:22):**  Sure.  
**[0:43:23-0:43:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:43:23):**  I would imagine the main things being access to water, of course, is essential to keeping  
**[0:43:27-0:43:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:43:27):**  saplings alive.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:43:29):**  And then whatever competition they might have from weeds, grasses especially, can be a bit  
**[0:43:35-0:43:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:43:35):**  of a killer for saplings.  
**[0:43:36-0:43:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:43:36):**  And then I know, at least in my area, wildlife can be a bit of a challenge.  
**[0:43:42-0:43:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:43:42):**  And we have wild boar.  
**[0:43:43-0:43:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:43:43):**  I know in Minnesota, you've got deer pressure.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:43:46):**  Those things need to be considered as well, right?  
**[0:43:49-0:43:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:43:49):**  Yeah.  
**[0:43:50-0:43:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:43:50):**  So if you do have the potential for rabbits or deer or whatever, you can put a fence around.  
**[0:43:58-0:44:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:43:58):**  Sometimes people do that.  
**[0:44:01-0:44:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:44:01):**  On the other hand, in an urban environment or a fence around also to keep domestic pets  
**[0:44:09-0:44:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:44:09):**  out or just to demarcate it and let people know, don't go walking around in here yet.  
**[0:44:15-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:44:15):**  Well, don't go walking around in here because we're trying to protect these.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:44:19):**  So just as kind of a signal.  
**[0:44:21-0:44:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:44:21):**  But then it can be removed.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:44:24):**  Once the trees are pretty established, the fence can and I think should be removed so  
**[0:44:29-0:44:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:44:29):**  that there is free flow of wildlife.  
**[0:44:33-0:44:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:44:33):**  Let me just go back to the maintenance also in terms of weeds and water.  
**[0:44:40-0:44:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:44:40):**  There's a really thick layer of mulch that gets put on the soil after you plant.  
**[0:44:47-0:44:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:44:47):**  And that really goes far in terms of limiting the maintenance because it's keeping the humidity  
**[0:44:53-0:45:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:44:53):**  in the soil and also keeping the weeds down a little bit.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:45:00):**  So that's part of the reason that the maintenance is not super intensive often.  
**[0:45:06-0:45:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:45:06):**  I would imagine too, at least in hotter climates where there are more growing days, the canopy  
**[0:45:12-0:45:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:45:12):**  is going to close up pretty fast given how densely planted everything is.  
**[0:45:16-0:45:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:45:16):**  And once that happens, you're going to minimize the weed pressure anyway.  
**[0:45:20-0:45:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:45:20):**  Exactly.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:45:21):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:45:23):**  So perhaps it's more of an issue in colder climates that the weeds can get established  
**[0:45:28-0:45:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:45:28):**  even before some of the trees have put on leaves, even as they grow bigger.  
**[0:45:32-0:45:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:45:32):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:45:33-0:45:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:45:33):**  It's all a little bit context specific.  
**[0:45:35-0:45:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:45:35):**  But even the smaller weeds, you don't need to worry about them too much.  
**[0:45:40-0:45:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:45:40):**  Like the wildflower, like smaller or lighter wildflowers that aren't too aggressive, you  
**[0:45:45-0:45:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:45:45):**  can leave them.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:45:46):**  In fact, in the Netherlands, part of the reason they had that intense 500 species biodiversity  
**[0:45:53-0:45:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:45:53):**  is because they let the wildflowers along the edge just stay there.  
**[0:45:58-0:46:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:45:58):**  And it was only the really aggressive things like in, I think in France and elsewhere in  
**[0:46:08-0:46:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:46:08):**  Europe, the Robinia is pretty aggressive.  
**[0:46:12-0:46:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:46:12):**  And it's woody, so it can grow fast and big.  
**[0:46:14-0:46:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:46:14):**  But mainly, you don't want to suffocate the plants.  
**[0:46:17-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:46:17):**  So you don't want the weeds to shade out the young saplings.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:46:21):**  So if they're not doing that, you don't necessarily need to take them out.  
**[0:46:25-0:46:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:46:25):**  And in fact, if you leave them in, it'll create more pollinator opportunities.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:46:30):**  Sure, sure.  
**[0:46:32-0:46:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:46:32):**  And there's a lot to be said for companion planting down at the ground level too.  
**[0:46:35-0:46:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:46:35):**  The forms at that level can be really beneficial to the growth of plants and help them in a  
**[0:46:42-0:46:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:46:42):**  myriad of ways from mining nutrients to fixing nitrogen to attracting pollinators, maybe  
**[0:46:48-0:46:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:46:48):**  even keeping pests away, certain types of flowers.  
**[0:46:52-0:46:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:46:52):**  All of these consortiums can figure out where they fit in the niche within the ecosystem  
**[0:46:56-0:47:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:46:56):**  and make themselves comfortable and make friends with their neighbors, I suppose.  
**[0:47:02-0:47:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:47:02):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:47:03-0:47:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:47:03):**  And make friends with the microorganisms in the soil.  
**[0:47:06-0:47:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:47:06):**  Sure.  
**[0:47:07-0:47:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:47:07):**  Yeah, it makes me think about the potential of putting in mycorrhizal inoculants as well,  
**[0:47:14-0:47:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:47:14):**  especially in places where the soil is quite poor.  
**[0:47:18-0:47:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:47:18):**  And depending on the quality of the compost that you get, which when you get into higher  
**[0:47:22-0:47:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:47:22):**  quantities might be really expensive.  
**[0:47:26-0:47:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:47:26):**  That could be a way to extend the reach of the trees root systems before they get established  
**[0:47:32-0:47:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:47:32):**  on their own while creating those beneficial connections below the soil surface.  
**[0:47:37-0:47:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:47:37):**  Could be worth doing some experiments on.  
**[0:47:39-0:47:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:47:39):**  I think that's something I'm going to try here.  
**[0:47:41-0:47:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:47:41):**  In my context, the soil is extremely sandy and lacking in biological material down at  
**[0:47:48-0:47:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:47:48):**  the lower parts in the basin by the river.  
**[0:47:51-0:47:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:47:51):**  And I've been speaking with some soil scientists who have suggested that different types of  
**[0:47:55-0:47:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:47:55):**  mycorrhizal inoculants might be the key to making that work.  
**[0:47:59-0:48:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:47:59):**  Yeah, I know that they're like in Beirut, making compost tea is a big part of the process.  
**[0:48:07-0:48:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:48:07):**  Yeah, there's so many different ways to inoculate soil at this point with microbes, with fungi,  
**[0:48:15-0:48:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:48:15):**  with nematodes, all sorts of beneficial creatures that help to fortify the soil food web that  
**[0:48:22-0:48:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:48:22):**  I think it's just going to be a matter of context and probably budget too.  
**[0:48:27-0:48:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:48:27):**  Unless you have a lot of time to kind of overcome the costs of bringing these types of things  
**[0:48:31-0:48:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:48:31):**  in by making them yourself, it can get expensive kind of quick.  
**[0:48:35-0:48:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:48:35):**  Yeah, this is really interesting.  
**[0:48:38-0:48:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:48:38):**  So this can work pretty much anywhere in the world, right?  
**[0:48:41-0:48:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:48:41):**  It's just a matter of adapting it to your climate and your soil conditions for the most  
**[0:48:45-0:48:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:48:45):**  part?  
**[0:48:46-0:48:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:48:46):**  It can work anywhere where forests would normally grow, where the climate is suitable for forests.  
**[0:48:54-0:49:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:48:54):**  So if you have like in the Great Plains in the US, you have, well, at one point we had  
**[0:49:03-0:49:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:49:03):**  an incredibly biodiverse, highly functional prairie and that was perfectly adapted to  
**[0:49:13-0:49:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:49:13):**  the climate there.  
**[0:49:14-0:49:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:49:14):**  And much of it has been replaced by agriculture.  
**[0:49:18-0:49:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:49:18):**  But if you were going to restore that area, restoring the grasslands would be the best  
**[0:49:25-0:49:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:49:25):**  idea.  
**[0:49:26-0:49:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:49:26):**  And perhaps along rivers, rivers and streams tend to have a woody area on the side.  
**[0:49:33-0:49:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:49:33):**  So the Miwauke method would apply there.  
**[0:49:41-0:49:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:49:41):**  But much of the world does have a climate suitable to forest.  
**[0:49:46-0:49:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:49:46):**  So in every place where there is, then a Miwauke method would work.  
**[0:49:52-0:49:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:49:52):**  It really makes me think about how many different configurations could be trialed here because  
**[0:49:59-0:50:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:49:59):**  I know that Miwauke didn't really advocate for doing these types of plantings for any  
**[0:50:03-0:50:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:50:03):**  sort of production, not for fruit harvest or perhaps timber or anything.  
**[0:50:08-0:50:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:50:08):**  This is much more for rewilding.  
**[0:50:10-0:50:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:50:10):**  But there seems to be a spectrum in the configurations and the planning that can be done for an agroforestry  
**[0:50:19-0:50:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:50:19):**  planting all the way up to these rewilding, very, very highly diverse and dense plantings.  
**[0:50:24-0:50:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:50:24):**  And then you take a step back and you can go into perhaps centropic agroforestry, which  
**[0:50:29-0:50:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:50:29):**  I've also worked with, going into less diversity all the way back to monocultures, which we're  
**[0:50:34-0:50:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:50:34):**  definitely moving away from.  
**[0:50:35-0:50:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:50:35):**  But that there's a medium ground, depending on the needs of the project or the outcome  
**[0:50:42-0:50:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:50:42):**  of a business endeavor that you may need from this, that can integrate diversity and natural  
**[0:50:48-0:50:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:50:48):**  species while also having room for production species and maybe even timber and fruit or  
**[0:50:57-0:51:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:50:57):**  berries or whatever it might be that you're trying to get a yield out of that would otherwise  
**[0:51:01-0:51:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:51:01):**  then justify the diversity that would be difficult to integrate into, say, a monoculture or a  
**[0:51:09-0:51:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:51:09):**  place where you're only trying to make money out of.  
**[0:51:11-0:51:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:51:11):**  I think there's an opportunity to explore a lot of this.  
**[0:51:16-0:51:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:51:16):**  And yeah, this is one of these wonderful pieces of the puzzle that, thank goodness, someone  
**[0:51:22-0:51:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:51:22):**  has done all of the research to advance and to trial in many different places.  
**[0:51:29-0:51:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:51:29):**  And it fits beautifully with so many of the configurations that can motivate people to  
**[0:51:33-0:51:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:51:33):**  reforest in their area.  
**[0:51:35-0:51:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:51:35):**  Yeah.  
**[0:51:36-0:51:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:51:36):**  Well, yeah.  
**[0:51:37-0:51:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:51:37):**  So it's sort of the idea of a multifunctional ecosystem where it's, you know, where it works  
**[0:51:45-0:51:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:51:45):**  for wildlife and it works for people too, even in an economic sense.  
**[0:51:50-0:52:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:51:50):**  And I would say on the Yakama Nation and in Cameroon, both of the people I interviewed  
**[0:52:00-0:52:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:52:00):**  in both places were talking about a relationship that people have with forest species.  
**[0:52:10-0:52:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:52:10):**  And so in Cameroon, people know the native species.  
**[0:52:15-0:52:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:52:15):**  They're really knowledgeable about what local species are and what medicinal properties  
**[0:52:22-0:52:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:52:22):**  or fruits they have.  
**[0:52:24-0:52:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:52:24):**  And so once you have these forests established, and that was part of Limbi's goal, was it  
**[0:52:33-0:52:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:52:33):**  was the ecological and social value of forest.  
**[0:52:37-0:52:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:52:37):**  Women especially have been harvesting forest products in a sustainable way for a long time  
**[0:52:44-0:52:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:52:44):**  and have that knowledge.  
**[0:52:45-0:52:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:52:45):**  And so it's, you know, the forests are not only to recharge the water table and restore  
**[0:52:51-0:53:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:52:51):**  the land, but also to eventually, once they're established, to be able to harvest medicinal  
**[0:53:00-0:53:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:53:00):**  botanical products and things like that in a sustainable way.  
**[0:53:05-0:53:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:53:05):**  And then in the Yakama Nation, they have a tradition of harvesting a root crop in the  
**[0:53:11-0:53:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:53:11):**  mountains, in the forested mountains.  
**[0:53:14-0:53:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:53:14):**  And so they planted some of those, some of the things that they have always used that  
**[0:53:21-0:53:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:53:21):**  are forest products.  
**[0:53:22-0:53:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:53:22):**  They planted them with the hiniwaki forest they planted there.  
**[0:53:28-0:53:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:53:28):**  So that's already an idea of the ways in which wildlife and people can share a space in a  
**[0:53:37-0:53:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:53:37):**  balanced way.  
**[0:53:38-0:53:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:53:38):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:53:39-0:53:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:53:39):**  And just like you said, you know, there are so many cultures around the world that adapted  
**[0:53:44-0:53:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:53:44):**  through their relationship with the forest and the native species within them that provided  
**[0:53:49-0:53:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:53:49):**  for huge majorities of what they consumed in their lives, but also their crafts, their  
**[0:53:55-0:53:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:53:55):**  art, their buildings.  
**[0:53:58-0:54:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:53:58):**  And there are some fantastic resources to learn more about this, but they differ and  
**[0:54:03-0:54:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:54:03):**  are really beautifully unique in different areas of the world with their own histories  
**[0:54:08-0:54:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:54:08):**  and such.  
**[0:54:09-0:54:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:54:09):**  I grew up in Japan, and I remember some of the forestry traditions from there.  
**[0:54:14-0:54:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:54:14):**  And then in my time in the Pacific Northwest and the native relationships with the cedar  
**[0:54:19-0:54:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:54:19):**  trees around there.  
**[0:54:21-0:54:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:54:21):**  And now here in the Mediterranean area and the long history of agroforestry from coppicing  
**[0:54:27-0:54:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:54:27):**  to care of olive trees down in the lower basins and how those integrated with other perennial  
**[0:54:34-0:54:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:54:34):**  crops like vines, grapes and such.  
**[0:54:38-0:54:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:54:38):**  The more I travel, the more I learn about the close relationship that humans and cultures  
**[0:54:43-0:54:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:54:43):**  have developed with the forest where they grew.  
**[0:54:48-0:54:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:54:48):**  And hopefully this is an impetus for people to reestablish those relationships and learn  
**[0:54:53-0:54:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:54:53):**  more about the potential of the forestry configurations, even if they've been disconnected to them  
**[0:54:59-0:55:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:54:59):**  for some time.  
**[0:55:00-0:55:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:55:00):**  Yeah, a lot of potential there.  
**[0:55:02-0:55:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:55:02):**  Yeah.  
**[0:55:03-0:55:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:55:03):**  Well, so what advice would you give to someone who after hearing this is inspired to start  
**[0:55:09-0:55:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:55:09):**  a Milwaukee planting project?  
**[0:55:11-0:55:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:55:11):**  Where should they begin?  
**[0:55:13-0:55:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:55:13):**  Well, there's always this.  
**[0:55:17-0:55:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:55:17):**  But I think the steps are starting with getting a team together.  
**[0:55:25-0:55:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:55:25):**  Talk to people, talk to your friends, talk to people you think would be interested.  
**[0:55:30-0:55:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:55:30):**  Reach out to a city council member who has a real green perspective.  
**[0:55:39-0:55:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:55:39):**  Reach out to universities, but just start talking to people to figure out who is interested  
**[0:55:44-0:55:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:55:44):**  and who has really important skills to bring to the table and who has land that could be  
**[0:55:54-0:55:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:55:54):**  used for that.  
**[0:55:55-0:56:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:55:55):**  So yeah, I think and then there's lots of resources.  
**[0:56:02-0:56:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:56:02):**  There's lots of resources.  
**[0:56:04-0:56:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:56:04):**  In addition, online, A Forest has been creating open source materials for a long time.  
**[0:56:12-0:56:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:56:12):**  And they have a YouTube series going through all the steps.  
**[0:56:20-0:56:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:56:20):**  And they also do, they have training programs as well.  
**[0:56:26-0:56:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:56:26):**  So yeah, there's a lot of ways to start learning about the method and then to get it going  
**[0:56:36-0:56:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:56:36):**  in your area, you have to start talking to people.  
**[0:56:39-0:56:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:56:39):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:56:40-0:56:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:56:40):**  And I'm really glad you brought up the resources that A Forest put out because back when Shubenda  
**[0:56:44-0:56:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:56:44):**  was on the show the first time, they were just launching their crowdfunding campaign  
**[0:56:48-0:56:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:56:48):**  to get those started.  
**[0:56:49-0:56:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:56:49):**  And now that they're available, I'll be sure to link to those so that people can find them.  
**[0:56:54-0:56:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:56:54):**  Good idea.  
**[0:56:55-0:56:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:56:55):**  Yeah.  
**[0:56:56-0:56:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:56:56):**  Well, look, Hannah, thank you so much for taking the time.  
**[0:56:59-0:57:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:56:59):**  And before you go, can you tell listeners where they can find your book, The Mini Forest  
**[0:57:03-0:57:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:57:03):**  Revolution, and how they can get in touch with you to learn more?  
**[0:57:07-0:57:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:57:07):**  Yeah.  
**[0:57:08-0:57:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:57:08):**  Well, the book is published by Chelsea Green.  
**[0:57:11-0:57:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:57:11):**  So you can find it on the Chelsea Green website.  
**[0:57:16-0:57:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:57:16):**  And then it's also available online, most places where you can buy books online.  
**[0:57:22-0:57:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:57:22):**  And I have a website, hannahlewis.org.  
**[0:57:26-0:57:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:57:26):**  And so that's a good place to get in touch with me.  
**[0:57:30-0:57:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:57:30):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:57:31-0:57:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:57:31):**  Well, this was a really fun conversation.  
**[0:57:32-0:57:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:57:32):**  I already have some plans of starting some of these Milwaukee forest plantations on my  
**[0:57:39-0:57:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:57:39):**  client's land and possibly even on my place when I finally get moved in there.  
**[0:57:43-0:57:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:57:43):**  So I will definitely reach out to you.  
**[0:57:45-0:57:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:57:45):**  And I know for sure when those are going forward.  
**[0:57:46-0:57:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:57:46):**  I'd love to get your opinion on them.  
**[0:57:49-0:57:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:57:49):**  That's exciting to hear.  
**[0:57:50-0:57:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/hannah-lewis-on-the-mini-forest-revolution/#t=0:57:50):**  All right.

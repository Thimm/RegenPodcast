**[0:00:00-0:00:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:03-0:00:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:00:03):**  Here we dive deep into the worlds of permaculture, natural building, and regenerative living  
**[0:00:07-0:00:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:00:07):**  as we aspire to help you reach your highest potential for yourself, for your community,  
**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:00:12):**  and for this beautiful planet that we all share.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:00:14):**  As always, I'm your host Oliver Gaucher, and I have a great session for you in this week's  
**[0:00:18-0:00:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:00:18):**  episode, so let's jump right in!  
**[0:00:30-0:00:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:00:30):**  Are you looking for the best resources to help you build a regenerative lifestyle?  
**[0:00:35-0:00:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:00:35):**  New Society Publishers has been a leader in sustainable publishing for over 30 years.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:00:39):**  They publish good news and solutions for individuals and organizations seeking to change their  
**[0:00:43-0:00:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:00:43):**  lives so that they may change the world for the better.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:00:47):**  Their company mandate goes far beyond the single bottom line of profit.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:00:50):**  They care deeply not only about what they publish, but also how they do business.  
**[0:00:55-0:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:00:55):**  They believe in the authors that they take on and the works that they bring to the marketplace.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:00:59):**  From sustainable living to progressive parenting, New Society Publishers has the books you need  
**[0:01:04-0:01:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:01:04):**  to help build a better world.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:01:06):**  Buy your print and ebooks online at www.newsociety.com or at fine bookstores near you.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:01:14):**  Alright today's guest, Ted Breingar, is pushing the boundaries of natural and regenerative  
**[0:01:19-0:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:01:19):**  low-cost housing with his non-profit organization called Foxhole Homes.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:01:25):**  These earthship inspired homes are designed to serve the needs of homeless veterans, but  
**[0:01:29-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:01:29):**  also to help redefine what kind of lifestyle is possible on a very limited income.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:01:35):**  Foxhole Homes are designed to be entirely off-grid and to produce much of their own  
**[0:01:38-0:01:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:01:38):**  food as well.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:01:40):**  In this interview, Ted explains the inspiration behind the holistically regenerative design  
**[0:01:44-0:01:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:01:44):**  of the structures, with a whole slew of low-cost appropriate technology working to make the  
**[0:01:49-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:01:49):**  most of every resource and bit of energy as well.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:01:52):**  We get into how they keep costs down by salvaging and recycling materials, and we talk about  
**[0:01:57-0:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:01:57):**  the larger vision for complete communities in the future as well.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:02:01):**  Ted is a very inspiring speaker who unloads a ton of practical information in this session,  
**[0:02:05-0:02:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:02:05):**  so grab your notebooks and let's dive right on in.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:02:08):**  Hey Ted, thanks so much for joining us today.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:02:11):**  How are you doing?  
**[0:02:12-0:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:02:12):**  I am great.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:02:13):**  It's great to be with you.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:02:15):**  Lots of exciting stuff going on on our end of the world.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:02:18):**  Yeah, definitely sounds like it.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:02:19):**  So why don't we just get into the questions right away because I've got a ton of stuff  
**[0:02:22-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:02:22):**  I'd love to ask you.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:02:24):**  Fire away.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:02:25):**  Perfect.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:02:26):**  So to start us off, could you tell us a little bit about your personal background, how you  
**[0:02:29-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:02:29):**  got into natural building, and what inspired you to form the company of Foxhole Homes?  
**[0:02:36-0:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:02:36):**  Sure.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:02:37):**  So on the natural building end, I've been fascinated with that since I was a kid.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:02:43):**  My family growing up, we did a lot of service projects working down in Mexico, helping out  
**[0:02:48-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:02:48):**  there, and so I got to build a lot of Adobe as a teenager down there.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:02:55):**  And I've just always been, my whole life, fascinated with the idea of traditional natural  
**[0:03:03-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:03:03):**  building techniques.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:03:06):**  But I never did it for a living, right?  
**[0:03:08-0:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:03:08):**  It was just kind of a side interest, and I worked whenever I could just doing community  
**[0:03:15-0:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:03:15):**  service projects with that.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:03:18):**  As far as Foxhole Homes, along those lines, I bumped into Earthship Biotexture in the  
**[0:03:25-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:03:25):**  mid-90s when I was working as the out direct director at Fort Carson up in Colorado Springs  
**[0:03:33-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:03:33):**  working for the Army.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:03:36):**  But the thing that really inspired me to do Foxhole was actually coming up on four years  
**[0:03:43-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:03:43):**  ago.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:03:44):**  I had moved to New Mexico and thought, man, I want to take my wife up to Earthship so  
**[0:03:53-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:03:53):**  that she can check it out.  
**[0:03:56-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:03:56):**  Because I was like, hey honey, let's build one of these for ourselves.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:03:59):**  But my wife, despite being from Colorado, gets cold easy.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:04:02):**  So I joke that if she sees snow on television, she goes to get a sweatshirt.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:04:07):**  So I thought, well, I'll take her up to Earthship, we'll go in and kind of prove that this works.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:04:12):**  And so we went up there for a weekend, and that night that we got there, a cold front  
**[0:04:20-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:04:20):**  blew in, and it was 13 degrees with a sustained 30 mile an hour north wind.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:04:27):**  And I thought, man, there's no way this thing is going to be, you know, in a house with  
**[0:04:31-0:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:04:31):**  no heating system at all.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:04:34):**  And I thought, there's no way this thing is going to be comfortable enough for Elizabeth.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:04:39):**  And we woke up in the morning and it was 72 degrees and the floor was even warmer than  
**[0:04:44-0:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:04:44):**  that, and radiating heat up into the space.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:04:47):**  And it was just amazing.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:04:49):**  And I thought to myself, I want one of these.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:04:52):**  But there are a lot of veterans who are kind of on the bubble, who need that technology  
**[0:04:58-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:04:58):**  to be able to create a more stable lives for themselves.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:05:02):**  And so literally that was on Martin Luther King Day four years ago, and I had a dream.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:05:09):**  I said, you know, we're vets.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:05:12):**  And that's what started the adventure.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:05:14):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:05:15):**  So could you tell us a little bit about what a foxhole home is specifically?  
**[0:05:21-0:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:05:21):**  And how did you come up with the vision of creating regenerative housing specifically  
**[0:05:25-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:05:25):**  for veterans?  
**[0:05:26-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:05:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:05:27):**  So I mean, a foxhole home specifically, right?  
**[0:05:31-0:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:05:31):**  I mean, we're, our designs are based on the principles of Earthship biotexture.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:05:37):**  And I know you had Rowan on relatively recently.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:05:40):**  And so I'm not going to belabor that too much, but I'll hit them quick, right?  
**[0:05:43-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:05:43):**  So principle number one, you're building out of recycled, repurposed and locally available  
**[0:05:48-0:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:05:48):**  materials.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:05:50):**  Principles number two and three have to do with the sun.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:05:53):**  That is you're generating your power with the sun and you're heating and cooling the  
**[0:05:58-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:05:58):**  home with the sun.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:06:00):**  And then the last three principles basically have to do with water, but you're catching  
**[0:06:04-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:06:04):**  water off the roof.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:06:06):**  You're treating water with systems within the home so that there is little or no fluid  
**[0:06:13-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:06:13):**  discharge from the system as a whole.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:06:15):**  And finally you're growing food.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:06:17):**  And so, and those are just straight, the kind of the Earthship biotexture principles.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:06:22):**  And so we've taken those principles and come up with some designs that are more regionally  
**[0:06:30-0:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:06:30):**  appropriate for where we are for the difference in climate and also are focused on being able  
**[0:06:36-0:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:06:36):**  to be built inexpensively.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:06:38):**  And then of course the name Foxhole has the military connotation, right?  
**[0:06:44-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:06:44):**  You know, being in a foxhole, but it actually, the inspiration for the name comes from a  
**[0:06:50-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:06:50):**  story where this lawyer came up to Jesus and said, I want to follow you.  
**[0:06:55-0:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:06:55):**  And Jesus' response was, foxes have holes, birds have nests, but the son of man has no  
**[0:07:00-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:07:00):**  place to lay his head.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:07:03):**  Jesus was homeless.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:07:05):**  But that same phrase was also a really powerfully political statement in that the king at the  
**[0:07:12-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:07:12):**  time, his nickname was the fox.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:07:15):**  And so it was a reference to how the rich and powerful do a lot of times take care of  
**[0:07:20-0:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:07:20):**  themselves.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:07:22):**  But they leave other folks locked out of the system.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:07:25):**  And certainly that has become the case for a lot of veterans.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:07:29):**  And we're trying to adapt the system and work in ways that allow folks to take care of themselves.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:07:37):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:07:38):**  Yeah, that's very important.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:07:40):**  So could you walk me through the design of one of your already built Foxhole homes?  
**[0:07:46-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:07:46):**  What types of natural and recycled materials do you use in the construction?  
**[0:07:50-0:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:07:50):**  And what are some of the main components of the structure?  
**[0:07:53-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:07:53):**  Sure.  
**[0:07:54-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:07:54):**  And so the ones that we've done so far have been built very similar to earthship systems  
**[0:08:00-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:08:00):**  where we're using rammed earth tires for our primary wall structures.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:08:05):**  And then we're trying to use just as much recycled and repurposed material as we can.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:08:11):**  So our ceilings are made out of old pallet wood, but that are cut into kind of a herringbone  
**[0:08:16-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:08:16):**  pattern both to take maximum use of the amount of material that you have to fit well between  
**[0:08:26-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:08:26):**  ceiling rafters on two foot centers, but also to kind of create some visual interest.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:08:31):**  Our insulation in the ceiling is actually corrugated cardboard that we cut to fit perfectly  
**[0:08:36-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:08:36):**  between the rafters and then wrap in a flame retardant foil barrier to take care of both  
**[0:08:42-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:08:42):**  the vapor barrier piece as well as create additional fireproof fire resistance in that  
**[0:08:50-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:08:50):**  system.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:08:51):**  We're using bottle bricks much like earthship on a lot of our south walls for whatever we  
**[0:08:58-0:09:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:08:58):**  can't find recycled or salvaged glass for.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:09:02):**  Of course, the interior finishes of the home are adobe or cob, earthen plasters on the  
**[0:09:09-0:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:09:09):**  inside.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:09:11):**  And then on the front of the home, the thing that we've done that's really different from  
**[0:09:16-0:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:09:16):**  what earthship has done, where they've had a full glassed in second greenhouse, we're  
**[0:09:21-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:09:21):**  just using traditional high tunnel greenhouse hoops to create the greenhouse space on the  
**[0:09:28-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:09:28):**  front.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:09:29):**  And that allows us in our much hotter climate than what they have up in Taos is we could  
**[0:09:35-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:09:35):**  put greenhouse plastic on it in the wintertime and then switch over to shade cloth in the  
**[0:09:40-0:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:09:40):**  summer, which is really critical as far south as we are because you would just on a day  
**[0:09:45-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:09:45):**  when it's 110 outside, if you had greenhouse plastic on that in the summertime, goodness  
**[0:09:52-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:09:52):**  it'd be, you'd kill every plant on the inside.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:09:55):**  And so we've created that system that's adaptable in between summer and winter to be appropriate  
**[0:10:02-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:10:02):**  kind of year round and still keep the cost way down.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:10:05):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:10:06):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:10:07):**  That's what I was going to say.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:10:08):**  I'd imagine you save a lot in not having to either salvage or buy the glazing for that  
**[0:10:13-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:10:13):**  much glass work as well.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:10:15):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:10:16):**  So far we've spent zero money on glass and any on, on, on the two builds that we've done  
**[0:10:19-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:10:19):**  so far just by, by being able to do use salvage stuff or you know, bottle bricks in between  
**[0:10:26-0:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:10:26):**  where those are.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:10:27):**  In fact, our first demonstration build, which is a tiny, I mean, it's tiny house, so 120  
**[0:10:32-0:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:10:32):**  square feet of interior floor space, 240 square foot of greenhouse, but it's got a little  
**[0:10:37-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:10:37):**  kitchenette composting toilet.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:10:40):**  You know a simple shower bag system, but with a French drain in the floor that feeds out  
**[0:10:44-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:10:44):**  into planter beds and the greenhouse, the whole thing, the material costs for that build  
**[0:10:50-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:10:50):**  to include cisterns, solar system, everything was $5,800.  
**[0:10:55-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:10:55):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:10:56):**  I really liked that you emphasized the smaller living space because I mean, that's something  
**[0:11:01-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:11:01):**  that I harp on a lot in my own courses, no matter how sustainable or regenerative the  
**[0:11:07-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:11:07):**  materials that you use in the construction are, you're never going to have a very efficient  
**[0:11:12-0:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:11:12):**  structure if it's oversized.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:11:14):**  Huge.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:11:15):**  If, yeah, if you've got a bunch of unused empty space that you're trying to heat, you're  
**[0:11:19-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:11:19):**  trying to air condition or trying to bring energy into.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:11:23):**  That's fantastic.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:11:24):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:11:25):**  Designing down is a, is a really, really key principle and we have to be really intentional  
**[0:11:29-0:11:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:11:29):**  to ask ourselves, what is it that we really need our house to do for us?  
**[0:11:34-0:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:11:34):**  What are the functions that it needs to have and how do we live and do we need to make  
**[0:11:40-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:11:40):**  a few kind of design considerations to adapt that a little bit?  
**[0:11:44-0:11:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:11:44):**  Okay.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:11:45):**  You know, okay, so I entertain once in a while, do I need my house to be big enough to do  
**[0:11:48-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:11:48):**  that or can I just do that with a covered patio?  
**[0:11:52-0:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:11:52):**  Right.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:11:53):**  And keep that much simpler in the process.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:11:56):**  And so those are all things to consider as you go.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:12:00):**  That allows you to, to simplify upfront and and I think that's a really important the  
**[0:12:06-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:12:06):**  pole that if we get it right, ends up creating a lot of freedom because we're not living  
**[0:12:12-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:12:12):**  to serve our material possessions.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:12:15):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:12:16):**  I mean, I think that's one of the things that movements like the tiny house movement have  
**[0:12:21-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:12:21):**  really explored and pioneered.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:12:23):**  I realized that a lot of people are not able to move into a square footage quite that small,  
**[0:12:28-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:12:28):**  but what they've done is that they've showed that with a small amount of space and with  
**[0:12:33-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:12:33):**  really good design, you can make what are basically referred to as like convertible  
**[0:12:38-0:12:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:12:38):**  spaces.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:12:39):**  So it can be the kitchen.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:12:40):**  It can also be the dining room.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:12:41):**  It can also be there, you know, where you sleep just by moving around a couple of key  
**[0:12:46-0:12:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:12:46):**  components and by using those principles, you can still have a larger space that serves  
**[0:12:52-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:12:52):**  multiple functions, but you don't need then a separate room or a separate space for every  
**[0:12:56-0:12:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:12:56):**  single one of those functions.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:12:59):**  Just a few critical ones where privacy becomes an issue.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:13:04):**  And those are considerations as family sizes grow and all of those things that you've got  
**[0:13:07-0:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:13:07):**  to consider.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:13:09):**  And our design that we're working on that we're hoping will be kind of our standard  
**[0:13:14-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:13:14):**  kind of footprint for most of our stuff coming up for long term housing for folks will be  
**[0:13:20-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:13:20):**  based on about a 600 square foot model.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:13:25):**  And we're doing that because with the amount of rain that we get here, that's the amount  
**[0:13:29-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:13:29):**  of roof space we need in order to catch enough water to do the system sustainably.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:13:33):**  And so lots of different factors kind of come together, but designing down and keeping those  
**[0:13:37-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:13:37):**  spaces as small as they can be and simple is absolutely critical for being able to afford  
**[0:13:42-0:13:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:13:42):**  to do it.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:13:43):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:13:44):**  And that's true for anybody, whether it's a, you know, veterans housing project or even  
**[0:13:48-0:13:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:13:48):**  just trying to get your own house up, especially when you're a novice builder.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:13:52):**  A lot of people get very overambitious.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:13:54):**  I'm sure you've seen this happen, too, in courses and stuff.  
**[0:13:57-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:13:57):**  Start small.  
**[0:13:58-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:13:58):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:13:59):**  Always start small.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:14:00):**  So tell me a little bit about the appropriate technologies and the regenerative systems  
**[0:14:04-0:14:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:14:04):**  that you've put into the design that help the residents to take care of their own needs  
**[0:14:08-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:14:08):**  and to provide for themselves.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:14:11):**  So again, that's going to kind of very much follow the Earthship system.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:14:15):**  So we're heating and cooling the system with the sun, right, starting with heating and  
**[0:14:21-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:14:21):**  cooling.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:14:22):**  And that's the most energy consumptive part of a home is maintaining the climate.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:14:28):**  And our first build that we, in our first kind of demonstration build is we've been  
**[0:14:32-0:14:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:14:32):**  monitoring that over the last several years.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:14:35):**  The first winter that we built it, it was for Southern New Mexico standards.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:14:39):**  It was cold.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:14:40):**  We had routinely had nighttime lows in the teens.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:14:44):**  During that time after we got the building, kind of the thermal mass of the building charged  
**[0:14:47-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:14:47):**  up initially, the interior temperature of the home never dropped below 72 degrees.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:14:53):**  This last summer, we had two weeks straight where it was almost 110 degrees.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:14:58):**  The interior space of the home never got above 80 with no power input at all, just the design  
**[0:15:04-0:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:15:04):**  of the home and some passive cooling systems that we've designed to be specifically appropriate  
**[0:15:10-0:15:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:15:10):**  for this area.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:15:12):**  But so that's one of the first big things is that we're not paying for heating and cooling  
**[0:15:16-0:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:15:16):**  and the house does that on its own.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:15:18):**  It catches water, right?  
**[0:15:20-0:15:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:15:20):**  So that we're not having to, I mean, we're having to augment it a little bit because  
**[0:15:24-0:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:15:24):**  we are in a desert, but the majority of our water needs are just met from rainfall naturally  
**[0:15:31-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:15:31):**  in the area.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:15:33):**  Another big principle is that in the water treatment side, we're growing food in the  
**[0:15:40-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:15:40):**  process and that enables folks to really take care of themselves.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:15:46):**  But I think another kind of big principle and specifically part of what works for veterans  
**[0:15:53-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:15:53):**  is that there's a huge piece of our world where the consequences for our behavior are  
**[0:15:59-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:15:59):**  far removed from the actions themselves.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:16:03):**  And somebody who's lived this really kinetic life of combat, it's hard to get them motivated  
**[0:16:09-0:16:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:16:09):**  sometimes to do anything if there's no immediate need to do it.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:16:16):**  And the houses are built in such a way and the systems work great, but they require that  
**[0:16:22-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:16:22):**  we interact with them.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:16:23):**  But what that does is that really encourages the occupants, the vets to live in the moment.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:16:31):**  Because if I don't go open event, it's going to get too hot.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:16:33):**  If I don't go close event, it's going to get too cold.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:16:35):**  And then at some level, literally the house itself and living in this intentional in the  
**[0:16:42-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:16:42):**  moment way that's required with these passive systems, the house literally becomes a therapeutic  
**[0:16:49-0:16:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:16:49):**  tool and actually a diagnostic tool.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:16:54):**  Because I can just walk by somebody's house and know if they're not doing the things that  
**[0:16:59-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:16:59):**  they need to do to operate it well, it gives me some insight into how they're doing individually  
**[0:17:05-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:17:05):**  and allows us without being too invasive moment to moment, be able to help keep track of folks  
**[0:17:11-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:17:11):**  and make sure that they're doing OK psychologically as well.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:17:16):**  That's a remarkable insight and I'm really glad you brought it up.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:17:19):**  One of the few compromises that switching to these regenerative systems for providing  
**[0:17:24-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:17:24):**  for comfort and needs in a house is that you may not be paying for some sort of energy  
**[0:17:31-0:17:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:17:31):**  to come in and run your systems.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:17:33):**  But the trade off is that you've got to maintain them.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:17:36):**  You have to be a little bit more active in how they're kept up.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:17:38):**  And because most of these end up being quite customized to the people living in them, there's  
**[0:17:43-0:17:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:17:43):**  a lot of little intricacies that you'll figure out over time on how to run things optimally.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:17:50):**  And it really requires more participation.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:17:52):**  And like you said, being in the moment in order to run the systems at their peak.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:17:59):**  And like you mentioned also, it's almost a practice in meditation, in participation,  
**[0:18:06-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:18:06):**  further into your own living systems, being aware of the weather outside, the comfort  
**[0:18:13-0:18:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:18:13):**  level of your body, how your energy consumption, either through devices or water needs for  
**[0:18:20-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:18:20):**  the plants that you're taking care of, are currently asking for.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:18:23):**  And I feel like this reconnect is probably a bit of an adjustment for someone who's not  
**[0:18:29-0:18:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:18:29):**  used to living in such a participatory environment.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:18:32):**  But I know for myself, when I have lived in those environments, the power to reconnect  
**[0:18:38-0:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:18:38):**  you to your place and to your time is absolutely invaluable once you get used to it.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:18:43):**  And I think that's a really fantastic thing to promote, not as sort of a compromise, as  
**[0:18:49-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:18:49):**  if it were a downside because you're not using energy, but rather as something to strive  
**[0:18:56-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:18:56):**  for and actually aspire to in reconnecting with your living environment.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:19:00):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:19:01):**  And I mean, it can be a catch-22.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:19:02):**  One of Kenny, one of the engineering professors at New Mexico State University that we work  
**[0:19:07-0:19:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:19:07):**  with all the time as we're working on developing some of the systems, he says, the problem  
**[0:19:11-0:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:19:11):**  with passive homes is that they're for active people.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:19:15):**  We've got to...  
**[0:19:16-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:19:16):**  That's really well said.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:19:17):**  But we've got to participate in them.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:19:19):**  And on some levels, we are working towards some automation of some of the basic systems  
**[0:19:23-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:19:23):**  using Arduino technology and that kind of stuff for the long term.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:19:28):**  But on the front side, as we're getting people in, we're very, very intentionally keeping  
**[0:19:34-0:19:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:19:34):**  those automation pieces out for the therapeutic value of helping people stay engaged and using  
**[0:19:43-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:19:43):**  that as this very, very intentional tool because certainly in a deployment situation, a combat  
**[0:19:50-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:19:50):**  situation, life is very, very intentional in these very, very small things.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:19:57):**  But without consequences in kind of our modern environment, it's very easy for these folks  
**[0:20:02-0:20:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:20:02):**  to check out completely.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:20:03):**  And so designing the home where it requires that interaction becomes a really, really  
**[0:20:10-0:20:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:20:10):**  constructive thing to help them re-engage.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:20:14):**  Excellent.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:20:15):**  So how does your project and design help to address the specific needs of veterans who  
**[0:20:20-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:20:20):**  might be dealing with a variety of disabilities or limitations in order to lead abundant lives?  
**[0:20:26-0:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:20:26):**  Sure.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:20:27):**  So I want to kind of talk about that from a couple of different standpoints.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:20:32):**  By all means.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:20:34):**  The first and most important is the best people to take care of veterans are other veterans.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:20:40):**  And so the most important aspect of what we're doing is that it is a veteran community where  
**[0:20:49-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:20:49):**  veterans can take care of and support one another because nobody understands their needs  
**[0:20:54-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:20:54):**  like they do.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:20:56):**  And very often, I mean, I'm super excited about the technology that we're developing  
**[0:21:00-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:21:00):**  and all of that, but I tell people very frequently, that's just a tool.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:21:05):**  The Earthship technology, the housing technologies that we're developing, even some of the permaculture  
**[0:21:11-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:21:11):**  work that we're doing, those are tools.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:21:13):**  The purpose of this is to create a space where veterans can support one another.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:21:17):**  So that's the most important thing.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:21:20):**  But on the other side of it, as we move forward, I think I want to talk about the situation  
**[0:21:26-0:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:21:26):**  that's created the abundance of homelessness in our area.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:21:31):**  And I kind of want to frame it in the terms of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, if you're  
**[0:21:37-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:21:37):**  familiar with that kind of basic cycle.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:21:40):**  So at the bottom of Maslow's hierarchy of needs is physiological needs.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:21:45):**  And we're talking basic stuff, eat, sleep, poop, super, super basic things.  
**[0:21:54-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:21:54):**  And I'm going to talk about a combat veteran, but they're only an example of anybody who's  
**[0:22:00-0:22:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:22:00):**  been through significant trauma and has lived in these kind of survival situations, whether  
**[0:22:08-0:22:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:22:08):**  that was from abuse or any other thing.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:22:10):**  So the person who's lived in that environment, in this kind of dangerous environment for  
**[0:22:14-0:22:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:22:14):**  any long period of time, and I'm going to use, I live in Alamogordo, New Mexico.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:22:22):**  It has the second lowest property crime in the entire state of New Mexico.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:22:27):**  The climate is nice.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:22:30):**  You're rarely in danger of death from exposure, either by hot or cold.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:22:39):**  So it's not a terribly inhospitable place to live.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:22:45):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:22:46):**  And so somebody who's literally lived in a combat environment where people were shooting  
**[0:22:51-0:23:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:22:51):**  at them, right, or for somebody who's lived sleeping in the dirt, eating MREs and that  
**[0:23:03-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:23:03):**  kind of thing, having those basic physiological needs met, that's not terribly complicated  
**[0:23:10-0:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:23:10):**  here.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:23:13):**  That's actually pretty easy.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:23:16):**  And then the next layer up has to do with safety, but safety is actually divided into  
**[0:23:23-0:23:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:23:23):**  two parts, literal physical safety, and then, like I said, for the combat vet who's used  
**[0:23:29-0:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:23:29):**  to somebody shooting at them, right, this place doesn't feel dangerous at all, right?  
**[0:23:35-0:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:23:35):**  But the flip side of that has to do with stability, and that is, is your situation stable over  
**[0:23:40-0:23:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:23:40):**  the long term?  
**[0:23:42-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:23:42):**  And so someone who, right now in America, it takes on average between 110 and 115 hours  
**[0:23:52-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:23:52):**  per month of work at minimum wage to rent and keep utilities going in the smallest apartment  
**[0:24:00-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:24:00):**  in the town.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:24:01):**  Yeah, that's unfortunate.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:24:02):**  When you consider that full time work is only 160, at best, you're talking about somebody  
**[0:24:09-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:24:09):**  having 50 hours left to feed, clothe, transport, take care of medical needs, all these other  
**[0:24:17-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:24:17):**  things, that's not sustainable in itself, much less if you consider that somebody has  
**[0:24:23-0:24:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:24:23):**  physical limitations, whether that's medical or psychological, that's not a, that system  
**[0:24:30-0:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:24:30):**  isn't stable for the long term.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:24:33):**  And at that point, homelessness becomes a rational choice.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:24:41):**  Because it's more stable, and the other needs, the basic physiological needs and the safety  
**[0:24:45-0:24:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:24:45):**  needs aren't out of whack, being homeless.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:24:49):**  And so it actually becomes a rational choice.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:24:51):**  And then if we take that a level further, which the next is kind of that kind of love  
**[0:24:56-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:24:56):**  and belonging piece, somebody who's literally living hand to mouth, they're, you know, kind  
**[0:25:03-0:25:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:25:03):**  of what's the, their ability to, you know, maintain good relationships is really, really  
**[0:25:10-0:25:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:25:10):**  limited.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:25:11):**  And a lot of our homeless population, they, they've, they're kind of a pretty tight little  
**[0:25:19-0:25:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:25:19):**  tribe, and they support one another very well.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:25:23):**  And at that point, the irony is, the homeless person living on the street is actually higher  
**[0:25:32-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:25:32):**  on Maslow's hierarchy of needs than many of us who are just struggling to survive.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:25:37):**  And it really flips it on its head.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:25:39):**  Yeah, I mean, it's a really, it's a really rational choice at that point.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:25:45):**  And that's really screwed up.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:25:47):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:25:48):**  That from, from a really validated psychological profile standpoint, right, that, that it makes  
**[0:25:54-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:25:54):**  more sense to be homeless.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:25:57):**  And so that's what we're trying to do is we're trying to create a situation where that's  
**[0:26:01-0:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:26:01):**  no longer rational, that there is another choice that makes sense that is stable, that  
**[0:26:08-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:26:08):**  still allows them some dignity and a way to work in community where, you know, the relationships  
**[0:26:14-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:26:14):**  and the belonging can happen.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:26:18):**  And even more, that we can help them continue to work up that hierarchy toward, you know,  
**[0:26:24-0:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:26:24):**  self fulfillment and self actualization with with, you know, exploring their skills and  
**[0:26:30-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:26:30):**  interests and all of those other things in time.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:26:33):**  Now, and so that, that system as a whole, has to work to enable the continuation up  
**[0:26:44-0:26:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:26:44):**  Maslow's hierarchy, right?  
**[0:26:46-0:26:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:26:46):**  As just a simple way to explain it.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:26:50):**  That is what we're doing and everything else, all of the all of the technology, whether  
**[0:26:54-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:26:54):**  that's in housing or permaculture or, you know, cottage industries.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:26:59):**  Let's take a switch for just a moment and talk a little bit about some of the nuts and  
**[0:27:03-0:27:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:27:03):**  bolts of making this happen.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:27:06):**  Can you tell me about what are some of the costs associated with building and operating  
**[0:27:10-0:27:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:27:10):**  a foxhole home?  
**[0:27:11-0:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:27:11):**  And how have you gotten the construction affordable without sacrificing quality?  
**[0:27:16-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:27:16):**  Yeah, so there's, we have, there's, there's a maxim in the construction world.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:27:23):**  You've got three things in construction, good, fast and cheap.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:27:26):**  You can have two.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:27:27):**  Oh, I love this.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:27:28):**  I love it.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:27:29):**  I love it so much in all the courses that I teach.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:27:32):**  Right.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:27:33):**  And so, so yeah, so I'm preaching to the preacher here, I'm sure.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:27:36):**  But the, so, so far we have been on the good and cheap path, but that means that it's slow.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:27:46):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:27:47):**  Because we're using volunteer labor and we're just doing it as we can do it.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:27:51):**  And because, because that eliminates the labor, the labor costs and things.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:27:56):**  And so that's, that's probably the biggest principle of it.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:28:00):**  Right.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:28:01):**  Um, another thing that, uh, that, that we're trying to do has to do with the design side  
**[0:28:06-0:28:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:28:06):**  of it.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:28:07):**  And that is really focusing on using recycled and repurposed materials as much as possible.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:28:14):**  And at some level, I mean, people ask me all the time, what's the most expensive part of  
**[0:28:18-0:28:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:28:18):**  an earthship.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:28:19):**  And I say, yeah, it's the part that you have to pay for.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:28:22):**  Right.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:28:23):**  Right.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:28:24):**  And so what that means is that as much as possible, we're looking for the materials  
**[0:28:30-0:28:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:28:30):**  that are available in our environment and then designing the home or the building around  
**[0:28:38-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:28:38):**  those materials.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:28:39):**  So, so for example, somebody just gave us some, you know, some trusses, um, from, you  
**[0:28:47-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:28:47):**  know, that, that hadn't been used.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:28:49):**  Well, you know, those trusses are going to define the size of a workshop that hopefully  
**[0:28:57-0:29:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:28:57):**  we're going to start building, you know, late February or early March, but the building  
**[0:29:01-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:29:01):**  literally is getting designed around those roof trusses because that was what was available.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:29:07):**  The front face of that building is getting designed around glass that we were able to  
**[0:29:13-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:29:13):**  salvage out of a building that was being demolished.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:29:16):**  And we got, I mean, huge, you know, six foot high between three and five foot wide, you  
**[0:29:22-0:29:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:29:22):**  know, double pane plate glass windows that we were, you know, we're fortunate enough  
**[0:29:26-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:29:26):**  to be able to salvage out of a window.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:29:28):**  Well, that's going to define what the front face of that building looks like, um, so that  
**[0:29:33-0:29:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:29:33):**  we can use those materials well.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:29:34):**  And so designing around what's available is probably the most important piece to keeping  
**[0:29:41-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:29:41):**  those costs down.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:29:46):**  But I need to kind of caveat that really quickly and this beast, um, and oh, I'll kind of re-head  
**[0:29:53-0:29:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:29:53):**  this.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:29:54):**  I think one of the questions that you're going to ask later, but the other thing that you've  
**[0:29:57-0:30:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:29:57):**  got to consider is the, um, what, what regulatory environment are you working in and what can  
**[0:30:07-0:30:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:30:07):**  you do well in that environment?  
**[0:30:11-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:30:11):**  And so if one of the challenges with using weird materials and that kind of thing is  
**[0:30:15-0:30:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:30:15):**  that a lot of times there's additional engineering costs in that if it's a fully permitted building.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:30:21):**  And so that's something that you've got to take into account, um, as well.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:30:25):**  Um, in fact, I, I like to say to people, if they're, you know, talking about thinking  
**[0:30:31-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:30:31):**  about the design process for themselves is there's, there's three different or two main  
**[0:30:39-0:30:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:30:39):**  environments that you've got to think about.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:30:40):**  And then one constraint on your part, the constraint on your part is your budget, right?  
**[0:30:44-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:30:44):**  And, and that has to do both with time and money.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:30:48):**  Right.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:30:49):**  Um, but then on the environmental side is there's two environments that we've got to  
**[0:30:52-0:30:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:30:52):**  work with.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:30:53):**  One is the natural environment, like, you know, the climate and all of that, but the  
**[0:30:57-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:30:57):**  other is the regulatory environment that you're in.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:31:01):**  And so you've got to figure and the regulatory environment is often the more complicated  
**[0:31:05-0:31:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:31:05):**  one to address.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:31:06):**  Right.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:31:07):**  Certainly.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:31:08):**  Um, and so, and so you've got to take that into consideration as you're going, we have  
**[0:31:13-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:31:13):**  been incredibly fortunate, um, to have a really great working partnership with New Mexico  
**[0:31:20-0:31:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:31:20):**  State University.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:31:22):**  Um, and so their whole, I, sometimes I joke that their whole engineering department works  
**[0:31:27-0:31:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:31:27):**  for Foxhole because they have been so incredibly generous to help us, um, with some engineering,  
**[0:31:34-0:31:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:31:34):**  uh, work so that we can validate some of the more experimental methodologies that we're  
**[0:31:39-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:31:39):**  using upfront.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:31:40):**  Um, you know, we're, we're, you know, the engineers are willing to stamp that and, and  
**[0:31:46-0:31:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:31:46):**  that has allowed us to, um, keep the costs down without sacrificing performance.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:31:52):**  Like, so for example, um, they were super excited about what we did with the cardboard  
**[0:31:57-0:31:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:31:57):**  as insulation in the roof, right?  
**[0:31:59-0:32:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:31:59):**  I mean, homeless people have been using cardboard as insulation for a long time, but you know,  
**[0:32:03-0:32:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:32:03):**  with their help, we're able to literally validate it's our value performance in that application  
**[0:32:10-0:32:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:32:10):**  and, and confirm that it's going to be safe because of the way that we're doing it with  
**[0:32:15-0:32:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:32:15):**  the flame retardant foil barrier and all of that stuff.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:32:18):**  And while here we go, I was, you know, our first building was able to insulate the entire  
**[0:32:25-0:32:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:32:25):**  roof of the building for less than a hundred bucks.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:32:29):**  We're where in a normal build, like using conventional installations that would have  
**[0:32:33-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:32:33):**  been very near a thousand dollars to get the same performance out of it that we were able  
**[0:32:38-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:32:38):**  to.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:32:39):**  So taking, yeah, taking the time to do the work on the science end of it, um, is a way  
**[0:32:47-0:32:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:32:47):**  that we can do that inexpensively without sacrificing performance, but in some regulatory  
**[0:32:53-0:32:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:32:53):**  environments that's going to require some work with an engineer.  
**[0:32:55-0:33:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:32:55):**  And if you've got to pay that, then all of a sudden you've got this kind of catch 22  
**[0:33:01-0:33:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:33:01):**  situation that you're working in.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:33:02):**  But like I said, we've been really, really fortunate, um, to have this cooperative effort  
**[0:33:08-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:33:08):**  with New Mexico state university.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:33:10):**  That's allowed us to validate a bunch of that science upfront.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:33:13):**  Well, on that note, and I know you touched on this a little bit earlier with, uh, the  
**[0:33:18-0:33:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:33:18):**  hierarchy of needs and helping to provide for people beyond just the physical and, uh,  
**[0:33:25-0:33:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:33:25):**  needs-based requirements for life.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:33:28):**  Tell me about the larger vision of the Fox hole home community and what you're trying  
**[0:33:33-0:33:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:33:33):**  to achieve with the synchronization of multiple homes into a small community.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:33:38):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:33:39):**  So I mean, I just kind of reiterate what I said before, right?  
**[0:33:44-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:33:44):**  All of these other things that we're putting in the community are really tools toward the  
**[0:33:48-0:33:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:33:48):**  end of community.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:33:50):**  The thing that's really going to help veterans is that community piece.  
**[0:33:54-0:33:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:33:54):**  And so inside that community, there's going to be several different sets of stuff that  
**[0:33:58-0:34:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:33:58):**  are going to help make all that work.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:34:00):**  Um, the main part of course is the veteran community itself.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:34:05):**  Other things that for the, for the veterans that will help that work.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:34:09):**  We have a, uh, we have an Arroyo fan or where an intermittent stream bed kind of just soaks  
**[0:34:16-0:34:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:34:16):**  into the desert going through the middle of our property, which is a floodplain.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:34:21):**  But we're going to turn that into a big food forest.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:34:24):**  And we have more or less a Mediterranean climate.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:34:27):**  So we're looking at figs and pomegranates and olives and that kind of stuff as the,  
**[0:34:31-0:34:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:34:31):**  as kind of the foundation species.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:34:33):**  Um, inside that we'll have a whole section that's dedicated to cottage industry and having  
**[0:34:39-0:34:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:34:39):**  workshop spaces so that people can work when they're well.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:34:44):**  Um, something that I just kind of touched on, um, the reality for a lot of disabled  
**[0:34:50-0:34:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:34:50):**  veterans, and again, whether that's a physical disability or, um, or mental challenges, the  
**[0:34:57-0:35:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:34:57):**  possibility of them working a normal 40 hour a week job is almost non-existent.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:35:02):**  And so we're really striving toward both on the permaculture and or greenhouse.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:35:07):**  We helped have some farm to market kind of stuff within the community, CSA kind of stuff.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:35:14):**  Uh, or, or the cottage industry piece design work that veterans can do while they're well,  
**[0:35:23-0:35:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:35:23):**  that will allow them to have some income to meet the needs that aren't taken care of within  
**[0:35:27-0:35:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:35:27):**  the housing system itself.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:35:30):**  So it's this combination of having these simplified housing systems that not are not only are  
**[0:35:36-0:35:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:35:36):**  inexpensive to build, but have almost zero utility costs, you know, after they're operating  
**[0:35:42-0:35:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:35:42):**  well.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:35:43):**  So that that cost of living is super, super low.  
**[0:35:46-0:35:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:35:46):**  And then to have, um, work that they're able to do, that's realistic for them to kind of  
**[0:35:53-0:35:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:35:53):**  meet those needs.  
**[0:35:55-0:36:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:35:55):**  Um, the rest of the time, some other things that we'll be doing to kind of help support  
**[0:36:00-0:36:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:36:00):**  that, um, we'll be building some furnished rentals, um, for the area, the, the air force  
**[0:36:07-0:36:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:36:07):**  space that's very near here is primarily a training base.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:36:11):**  And so they're training pilots.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:36:13):**  And those pilots right now are getting paid.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:36:16):**  You know, many of them are getting paid 65 bucks a night for six to nine months at a  
**[0:36:20-0:36:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:36:20):**  time to stay in hotels in town.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:36:23):**  Well, I'm about to launder me some government money, you know, create them right to, to  
**[0:36:29-0:36:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:36:29):**  create some furnished rentals that will basically function as hotels that these pilots that  
**[0:36:34-0:36:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:36:34):**  are here for training can choose to stay here, knowing that the proceeds from that will then  
**[0:36:42-0:36:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:36:42):**  help to keep the community going, um, and moving forward.  
**[0:36:48-0:36:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:36:48):**  Um, and then, um, we have been able to, um, here in Otero County, if folks are familiar  
**[0:36:55-0:36:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:36:55):**  with earthship, you're probably familiar with the sustainable development of the task site  
**[0:36:59-0:37:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:36:59):**  act that Mike Reynolds got passed in the state of New Mexico.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:37:03):**  Um, we have worked to get a local version of that law passed that has, um, even kind  
**[0:37:10-0:37:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:37:10):**  of some more teeth.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:37:11):**  It's got stronger wording to allow us to continue to use those experimental buildings for the  
**[0:37:16-0:37:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:37:16):**  longterm, which isn't perfectly clear in the state version.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:37:20):**  Um, and so we will also be working on, on doing research.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:37:24):**  Um, and one of the, one of the research projects that we're going to be working on and this  
**[0:37:30-0:37:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:37:30):**  reoccurring theme that, um, as I go up to earth, the biotechs and work with those folks,  
**[0:37:35-0:37:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:37:35):**  talk to veterans that are going to earthship, a reoccurring theme there that many of them  
**[0:37:39-0:37:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:37:39):**  said is the reason that I'm here at earthship, you're going to the earthship Academy learning  
**[0:37:42-0:37:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:37:42):**  how to do this is I want to be able to take this technology back to the countries where  
**[0:37:49-0:37:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:37:49):**  I fought and help heal the land that I was part of kind of destroying.  
**[0:37:55-0:38:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:37:55):**  And um, and, and that started to kind of resonate with me and I started to look into that and  
**[0:38:01-0:38:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:38:01):**  started to look into refugee situations.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:38:05):**  And what we figured out was that the average stay in a refugee camp at this stage of the  
**[0:38:12-0:38:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:38:12):**  game is almost a decade.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:38:16):**  And so, uh, we're, we're looking at doing, um, some test sites that are specifically  
**[0:38:22-0:38:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:38:22):**  targeted at appropriate technologies for refugee situations.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:38:26):**  Um, and doing some partnerships with that, um, in the longterm with the New Mexico state  
**[0:38:33-0:38:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:38:33):**  university system, both our local campus, um, as well as the main campus, which is about,  
**[0:38:39-0:38:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:38:39):**  you know, an hour away from here.  
**[0:38:41-0:38:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:38:41):**  And so, um, excited about some longterm educational, um, opportunities as well that would allow  
**[0:38:49-0:38:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:38:49):**  students to, that are interested in, um, sustainable technologies and whether that's on the agricultural  
**[0:38:58-0:39:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:38:58):**  side or on the engineering and construction side, um, to be able to kind of come live  
**[0:39:05-0:39:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:39:05):**  on site and kind of live in a, you know, a living, working laboratory while they're pursuing  
**[0:39:13-0:39:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:39:13):**  their studies so that they can have a way to get the formal education and engineering  
**[0:39:18-0:39:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:39:18):**  as well as the hands-on application of that stuff at the same time.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:39:24):**  And so that's another kind of aspect where, um, these veterans were wanting to go do that.  
**[0:39:29-0:39:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:39:29):**  We're creating, uh, a system part partly for people who are interested in becoming part  
**[0:39:36-0:39:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:39:36):**  of the community for a longterm, but also for people who are just interested in exploring  
**[0:39:40-0:39:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:39:40):**  this technology, getting an education and then taking it someplace else, creating a  
**[0:39:45-0:39:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:39:45):**  way for them to do that, that is, you know, kind of meets their needs and yet is connected  
**[0:39:51-0:39:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:39:51):**  to a, you know, sort of, you know, like a recognized formal education system where they're  
**[0:39:57-0:40:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:39:57):**  able to kind of put those together.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:40:00):**  And we've, we're still in the initial phases of that, but, um, the New Mexico State University  
**[0:40:06-0:40:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:40:06):**  system has been super excited to work with us on that.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:40:10):**  And we're, we're excited, uh, for where that's going to lead.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:40:14):**  Yeah, I can imagine, man, I'm really impressed with the holistic design nature from which  
**[0:40:19-0:40:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:40:19):**  you're approaching all of this and how many aspects you've taken in to consider.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:40:23):**  And it's made me think that, you know, aside from just the specifics of this project, there  
**[0:40:27-0:40:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:40:27):**  are tons of elements in here that anyone could benefit from, anyone could benefit from.  
**[0:40:33-0:40:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:40:33):**  And I'm wondering what advice would you give to our listeners who are inspired to build  
**[0:40:37-0:40:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:40:37):**  their own home, but maybe don't know where to start.  
**[0:40:40-0:40:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:40:40):**  Sure, um, uh, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll do this from, from a couple of directions.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:40:46):**  One is that one of our goals as we move forward is that we're going to try to keep everything  
**[0:40:52-0:40:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:40:52):**  that we're developing just as open source as possible.  
**[0:40:54-0:40:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:40:54):**  Um, and so, uh, we've got to do a little bit of work on the front side to make sure that  
**[0:40:58-0:41:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:40:58):**  we're protecting that technology so that we can continue to use it.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:41:02):**  Um, but as soon as we've got that done, we'll be making that technology available to everybody.  
**[0:41:10-0:41:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:41:10):**  Um, on, on the challenge to, for people that are interested in doing this on, uh, on their  
**[0:41:16-0:41:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:41:16):**  own.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:41:17):**  The first thing that I would say is if, especially if you're talking about like full blown trying  
**[0:41:21-0:41:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:41:21):**  to create community, which, and again, we're just in the beginning phases of this, um,  
**[0:41:26-0:41:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:41:26):**  in the Foxhole community right now and still just getting stuff off the ground.  
**[0:41:31-0:41:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:41:31):**  Um, but find if you're, if your goal is to create a community, try to find a way to become  
**[0:41:37-0:41:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:41:37):**  part of a community for awhile and, and learn the lessons that you can, um, from within  
**[0:41:43-0:41:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:41:43):**  that community.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:41:44):**  But then the other is kind of goes back to, I said this before, but it's, it's, it's worth  
**[0:41:50-0:41:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:41:50):**  repeating when you're in that design phase, you've got two environments that you've got  
**[0:41:55-0:41:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:41:55):**  to deal with.  
**[0:41:56-0:42:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:41:56):**  One is your natural physical environment and the other is the regulatory environment.  
**[0:42:00-0:42:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:42:00):**  And you've got to find the right place to get that done.  
**[0:42:02-0:42:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:42:02):**  The right combination of those things that are going to match your skill sets and resources  
**[0:42:07-0:42:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:42:07):**  to get that done.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:42:09):**  And for the, and again, the more daunting piece for many, many people is that regulatory  
**[0:42:16-0:42:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:42:16):**  environment.  
**[0:42:17-0:42:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:42:17):**  And so don't get so caught up in pursuing the ideal building or process that you'd never  
**[0:42:29-0:42:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:42:29):**  get it done.  
**[0:42:30-0:42:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:42:30):**  And so I'll give you a, I'll give you a, for example of some of the things that we're working  
**[0:42:34-0:42:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:42:34):**  on right now as that our goal, um, the primary building technology that we're pursuing that  
**[0:42:40-0:42:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:42:40):**  we want to use is actually with tire bales, right?  
**[0:42:44-0:42:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:42:44):**  Pounding into tires, um, works great, but man, it's labor intensive.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:42:49):**  And unless you've got an army of volunteer labor as earthship often does, that's not  
**[0:42:53-0:42:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:42:53):**  practical for most people.  
**[0:42:55-0:42:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:42:55):**  So we're working on doing it with tire bales with it, where they take a hundred tires and  
**[0:42:59-0:43:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:42:59):**  compress them together and hold them together with galvanized metal bands to make a five  
**[0:43:03-0:43:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:43:03):**  foot square, two and a half foot tall, 2000 pound, you know, rubber block.  
**[0:43:10-0:43:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:43:10):**  And so that's what we're looking at for our longterm building technology.  
**[0:43:14-0:43:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:43:14):**  Well, it's taking us a long time to get that really kind of approved through the state,  
**[0:43:22-0:43:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:43:22):**  get the initial engineering done.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:43:25):**  And I mean, we're working on it.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:43:27):**  And in fact, we're working with the American society of civil engineers to actually have  
**[0:43:30-0:43:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:43:30):**  a model building code done that has the potential of making it part of the standard building  
**[0:43:36-0:43:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:43:36):**  code.  
**[0:43:37-0:43:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:43:37):**  But that's a years long process that we're working.  
**[0:43:40-0:43:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:43:40):**  Well, here in New Mexico, I could use something like Adobe or compressed earth blocks and  
**[0:43:46-0:43:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:43:46):**  get the majority of the performance out of it with a methodology that's already standardized.  
**[0:43:55-0:44:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:43:55):**  And so simply by saying, okay, well, I can't use, you know, tire bales, the thermal mass  
**[0:44:01-0:44:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:44:01):**  structure that I want to, but I could use compressed earth blocks right now.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:44:07):**  And simply by designing the glazing, facing the winter sun and, you know, putting in the  
**[0:44:13-0:44:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:44:13):**  other systems that make that work, I can do that right away with very, very little red  
**[0:44:18-0:44:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:44:18):**  tape and get it done.  
**[0:44:21-0:44:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:44:21):**  And it's not the ideal thing that I wanted, but it's going to work and I can do it right  
**[0:44:25-0:44:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:44:25):**  now.  
**[0:44:26-0:44:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:44:26):**  And so consider that regulatory environment piece and don't get so caught up on doing  
**[0:44:33-0:44:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:44:33):**  the perfect thing that you never move forward.  
**[0:44:37-0:44:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:44:37):**  Because a lot of times when we're working with these governments and trying to keep  
**[0:44:42-0:44:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:44:42):**  this stuff going, we've got to build some good faith with them over time and building  
**[0:44:47-0:44:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:44:47):**  a more normal structure as far as their view.  
**[0:44:52-0:44:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:44:52):**  But then being able to walk them through that as it's working and showing them how that  
**[0:44:57-0:45:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:44:57):**  works, then they get comfortable with that and they see that you're really trying to  
**[0:45:01-0:45:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:45:01):**  do the right thing and you're concerned and then they're going to be much more likely  
**[0:45:04-0:45:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:45:04):**  to work with you on some of the more experimental stuff in the long term.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:45:09):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:45:10-0:45:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:45:10):**  Yeah, that's fantastic advice.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:45:12):**  So before I let you go here and I want to let you get back to your morning, could you  
**[0:45:17-0:45:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:45:17):**  give us some contact information?  
**[0:45:19-0:45:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:45:19):**  How can people get in touch with you?  
**[0:45:21-0:45:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:45:21):**  And if you've got any upcoming events or ways that people can participate as well, let us  
**[0:45:25-0:45:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:45:25):**  know.  
**[0:45:26-0:45:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:45:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:45:27-0:45:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:45:27):**  So if you look for Foxhole Homes on any of your social media sites, so Facebook or YouTube,  
**[0:45:37-0:45:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:45:37):**  just search Foxhole Homes.  
**[0:45:39-0:45:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:45:39):**  You'll find us there.  
**[0:45:40-0:45:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:45:40):**  Our website is Foxhole.org and you'll be in at any of those three different places you're  
**[0:45:47-0:45:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:45:47):**  going to be able to find email addresses or phone numbers and all that kind of stuff.  
**[0:45:52-0:45:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:45:52):**  So Foxhole.org or Foxhole Homes at either Facebook or YouTube.  
**[0:45:59-0:46:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:45:59):**  So that's the contact information.  
**[0:46:01-0:46:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:46:01):**  Right now we've just wrapped up our first demonstration build on the 164 acres that's  
**[0:46:10-0:46:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:46:10):**  going to become the permanent community.  
**[0:46:14-0:46:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:46:14):**  It's basically a greenhouse where we'll be doing tree propagation and that kind of stuff  
**[0:46:19-0:46:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:46:19):**  to work on getting the food forest going.  
**[0:46:22-0:46:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:46:22):**  The next build we're hoping to start either late February or early March, which will be  
**[0:46:28-0:46:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:46:28):**  our first tire bale building, but it'll be a workshop.  
**[0:46:33-0:46:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:46:33):**  But largely that's going to be kind of weekend kind of stuff because again, that whole good,  
**[0:46:39-0:46:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:46:39):**  fast, cheap dichotomy.  
**[0:46:41-0:46:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:46:41):**  Right now I'm in a situation where from my day job I've simply just run out of vacation  
**[0:46:45-0:46:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:46:45):**  time.  
**[0:46:46-0:46:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:46:46):**  In the last three years I've spent 537 hours of vacation on Foxhole and I just don't have  
**[0:46:52-0:46:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:46:52):**  any more.  
**[0:46:53-0:46:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:46:53):**  So it'll largely be weekend stuff, but we do have volunteers that are camping on site  
**[0:46:59-0:47:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:46:59):**  and kind of tinkering away at some different projects along the way.  
**[0:47:02-0:47:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:47:02):**  And so again, hopefully we'll be starting that late February, early March.  
**[0:47:08-0:47:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:47:08):**  If folks want to come out and volunteer, the big pushes will be on the weekend, but certainly  
**[0:47:14-0:47:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:47:14):**  if folks have skills, they can continue to work kind of throughout time.  
**[0:47:18-0:47:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:47:18):**  And eventually, and this is frankly probably a couple of years down the road, we're working  
**[0:47:23-0:47:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:47:23):**  toward what will be a two week education program that will help folks go through some design  
**[0:47:31-0:47:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:47:31):**  considerations as they're working on their own design for their own sustainable home.  
**[0:47:37-0:47:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:47:37):**  And whether that's wall systems or electrical systems or plumbing systems, kind of going  
**[0:47:40-0:47:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:47:40):**  through a checklist of what's realistic for them, again, both for their natural environment  
**[0:47:46-0:47:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:47:46):**  as well as their legal and regulatory environment as they go.  
**[0:47:51-0:47:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:47:51):**  But that's coming up, but it's a ways down the road right now so that we can help folks  
**[0:47:58-0:48:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:47:58):**  work on getting designs for them that are really going to work.  
**[0:48:02-0:48:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:48:02):**  Wonderful.  
**[0:48:03-0:48:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:48:03):**  It sounds like all good stuff.  
**[0:48:05-0:48:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:48:05):**  I'm definitely going to try and swing by there if I get a chance to visit the States again  
**[0:48:09-0:48:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:48:09):**  anytime soon.  
**[0:48:10-0:48:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:48:10):**  I've got some good contacts.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:48:11):**  I used to work as well in Taos, away from the Earthship community, but really close  
**[0:48:16-0:48:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:48:16):**  actually.  
**[0:48:17-0:48:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:48:17):**  And I would love to come and see all the things that you're working on.  
**[0:48:20-0:48:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:48:20):**  The videos that you have on YouTube and on the website are fantastic.  
**[0:48:23-0:48:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:48:23):**  So if anybody's listening, definitely check those out to get a better idea of what Ted  
**[0:48:27-0:48:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:48:27):**  has been talking about.  
**[0:48:29-0:48:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:48:29):**  And yeah, Ted, thank you so much for taking the time today.  
**[0:48:31-0:48:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:48:31):**  This was really eye opening and some great perspectives, especially on design and holistic  
**[0:48:37-0:48:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-ted-brinegar-1/#t=0:48:37):**  approaches to your projects.

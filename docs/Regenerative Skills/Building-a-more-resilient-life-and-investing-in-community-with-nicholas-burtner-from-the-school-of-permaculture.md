**[0:16:34-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-a-more-resilient-life-and-investing-in-community-with-nicholas-burtner-from-the-school-of-permaculture/#t=0:16:34):**  like I wouldn't even say making a billion dollars would do it right I mean money is  
**[0:16:38-0:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-a-more-resilient-life-and-investing-in-community-with-nicholas-burtner-from-the-school-of-permaculture/#t=0:16:38):**  only valuable because we think it's valuable right seeds are actually valuable.

**[0:17:20-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-a-more-resilient-life-and-investing-in-community-with-nicholas-burtner-from-the-school-of-permaculture/#t=0:17:20):**  the husband in my family and I don't know a better way than through the concepts of  
**[0:17:25-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-a-more-resilient-life-and-investing-in-community-with-nicholas-burtner-from-the-school-of-permaculture/#t=0:17:25):**  permaculture which is indigenous wisdom and appropriate tech anyhow.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-a-more-resilient-life-and-investing-in-community-with-nicholas-burtner-from-the-school-of-permaculture/#t=0:17:29):**  So that's like the main focus and I tell you even though since my wife and I met I've already  
**[0:17:36-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-a-more-resilient-life-and-investing-in-community-with-nicholas-burtner-from-the-school-of-permaculture/#t=0:17:36):**  been on this journey teaching permaculture and consulting and working in this nonprofit

**[0:17:49-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-a-more-resilient-life-and-investing-in-community-with-nicholas-burtner-from-the-school-of-permaculture/#t=0:17:49):**  you know absolutely and that's been another element that I that neither one of us expected  
**[0:17:56-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-a-more-resilient-life-and-investing-in-community-with-nicholas-burtner-from-the-school-of-permaculture/#t=0:17:56):**  you know and you know obviously we're one we're moving forward but two you were working

**[0:18:07-0:18:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-a-more-resilient-life-and-investing-in-community-with-nicholas-burtner-from-the-school-of-permaculture/#t=0:18:07):**  concerns and talking through them and it's not something that can quickly be accomplished  
**[0:18:14-0:18:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-a-more-resilient-life-and-investing-in-community-with-nicholas-burtner-from-the-school-of-permaculture/#t=0:18:14):**  going over those concerns and it brings a lot of light to somebody who's like motivated  
**[0:18:19-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-a-more-resilient-life-and-investing-in-community-with-nicholas-burtner-from-the-school-of-permaculture/#t=0:18:19):**  to do it you know for example you had a child and wife which all of I don't think you do  
**[0:18:25-0:18:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-a-more-resilient-life-and-investing-in-community-with-nicholas-burtner-from-the-school-of-permaculture/#t=0:18:25):**  yeah but say that was the case and then you know she was on board and all of a sudden  
**[0:18:30-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-a-more-resilient-life-and-investing-in-community-with-nicholas-burtner-from-the-school-of-permaculture/#t=0:18:30):**  said hey look I'm having lots of doubts and questions I mean it would get you to doubt

**[0:18:39-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-a-more-resilient-life-and-investing-in-community-with-nicholas-burtner-from-the-school-of-permaculture/#t=0:18:39):**  beneficial to moving forward.

**[0:18:49-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-a-more-resilient-life-and-investing-in-community-with-nicholas-burtner-from-the-school-of-permaculture/#t=0:18:49):**  what kind of paint a picture for me as to what you're aspiring to now.  
**[0:18:53-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-a-more-resilient-life-and-investing-in-community-with-nicholas-burtner-from-the-school-of-permaculture/#t=0:18:53):**  You are correct so we had a suburban plot north of Dallas Texas in a little town called  
**[0:19:00-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-a-more-resilient-life-and-investing-in-community-with-nicholas-burtner-from-the-school-of-permaculture/#t=0:19:00):**  Plano and Plano is actually still where we teach our six month permaculture design course  
**[0:19:06-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-a-more-resilient-life-and-investing-in-community-with-nicholas-burtner-from-the-school-of-permaculture/#t=0:19:06):**  Plano Texas and I don't know I think it was 909 when we got the note on that and just

**[0:25:07-0:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-a-more-resilient-life-and-investing-in-community-with-nicholas-burtner-from-the-school-of-permaculture/#t=0:25:07):**  you're transitioning to I know like you had just mentioned you would really kind of established  
**[0:25:12-0:25:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-a-more-resilient-life-and-investing-in-community-with-nicholas-burtner-from-the-school-of-permaculture/#t=0:25:12):**  as many of the permaculture and appropriate technology things in your suburban we'll call

**[0:25:58-0:26:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-a-more-resilient-life-and-investing-in-community-with-nicholas-burtner-from-the-school-of-permaculture/#t=0:25:58):**  but like our school will be headquartered there and housed there as well as our as our

**[0:26:08-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-a-more-resilient-life-and-investing-in-community-with-nicholas-burtner-from-the-school-of-permaculture/#t=0:26:08):**  I could stop myself is the weaving of enterprise right whether it be you know we'll harvest

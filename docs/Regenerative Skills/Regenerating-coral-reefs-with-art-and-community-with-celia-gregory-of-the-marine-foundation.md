**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:00:09):**  You're in the right place for all things regenerative living, ecological restoration,  
**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:00:14):**  permaculture and natural building.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:00:16):**  I'm your host Oliver Gaucher.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:00:18):**  In this show, it's my job to interview leaders, innovators and rebels on the cutting edge  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:00:22):**  of their fields as we look for solutions to our generation's most urgent challenges  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:00:27):**  and share these techniques and information so that you can join us in creating a healthy  
**[0:00:31-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:00:31):**  and abundant world for everyone.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:00:33):**  So let's get started.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:00:40):**  New Society Publishers is proud to be celebrating 40 years of activist, solutions-oriented publishing.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:00:46):**  From our roots in non-violent civil disobedience training during the Vietnam War to today with  
**[0:00:51-0:00:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:00:51):**  over 500 books published, some across a dozen languages, we continue to bring positive solutions  
**[0:00:57-0:01:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:00:57):**  and cutting edge ideas to some of the most troubling challenges of our time.  
**[0:01:02-0:01:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:01:02):**  Having never wavered from our mission to help build a just and ecologically sustainable  
**[0:01:06-0:01:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:01:06):**  society placing planet and people before profit, we are proud to hold the highest environmental  
**[0:01:12-0:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:01:12):**  and social standards of any publisher in North America.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:01:16):**  With a dedicated community of change makers and thought leaders always working ahead of  
**[0:01:20-0:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:01:20):**  the curve, we look forward to another 40 years of bringing our readers books for a world  
**[0:01:25-0:01:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:01:25):**  of change.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:01:27):**  Alright, welcome back family and friends to this ongoing series on Waterway Regeneration.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:01:33):**  I've covered so many approaches to this subject up until now, and over the last two  
**[0:01:38-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:01:38):**  weeks I've been exploring regenerative solutions to the environmental degradation of marine  
**[0:01:42-0:01:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:01:42):**  ecosystems.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:01:43):**  And so today we'll be looking closely at some creative ways of protecting and even  
**[0:01:47-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:01:47):**  reseeding coral reefs in my interview with Celia Gregory.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:01:52):**  So Celia is the founder of the Marine Foundation, an eco arts organization that uses art for  
**[0:01:57-0:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:01:57):**  change not only in awareness and education but also directly in the restoration of coral  
**[0:02:02-0:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:02:02):**  reef habitats, fish stocks, and associated provision of livelihood.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:02:07):**  Celia has over 25 years directing and managing a varied selection of creative projects around  
**[0:02:12-0:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:02:12):**  the world.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:02:14):**  And having completed her PADI Pro Dive Master in Costa Rica back in 2004, she was inspired  
**[0:02:19-0:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:02:19):**  to take her creative process under the sea, developing art in symbiosis with marine conservation.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:02:26):**  From there she created the Living Sculptures in the Sea program, an international series  
**[0:02:31-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:02:31):**  of underwater sculptures and creative collaboration of local communities, conservation organizations,  
**[0:02:38-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:02:38):**  science and the creative arts.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:02:39):**  Now through the Marine Foundation, Celia has successfully developed projects in several  
**[0:02:44-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:02:44):**  international locations, facilitating programs for local communities.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:02:49):**  I first got to know Celia as a co-instructor with me on the Ecosystem Restoration Design  
**[0:02:53-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:02:53):**  course with Guy Education and I was fascinated by her unique approaches to community collaboration  
**[0:02:58-0:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:02:58):**  through culturally representative art.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:03:01):**  In this interview, though we certainly talk a lot about the specifics of coral habitat  
**[0:03:05-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:03:05):**  restoration and the urgent need to create reserves and sanctuaries to revive coastal  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:03:10):**  areas that have been destroyed, we also focus a lot on Celia's remarkable stories from  
**[0:03:15-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:03:15):**  the communities that she's worked with to accomplish these projects.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:03:19):**  I myself have worked mostly with local communities and countries that were foreign to me and  
**[0:03:23-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:03:23):**  I really connected with the compassionate and inclusive approach that Celia speaks to  
**[0:03:27-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:03:27):**  from her own experience.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:03:28):**  I've always found that the community aspect of regenerative projects is the most overlooked  
**[0:03:33-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:03:33):**  in the design and planning stage.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:03:36):**  While some enterprises eventually find success with weak community integration, the ones  
**[0:03:40-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:03:40):**  that create long-lasting and holistic solutions are the ones that are built around the need  
**[0:03:45-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:03:45):**  wants and cultural nuance of the places where they're based.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:03:49):**  Ownership and responsibility centered around the people of that place are points that Celia  
**[0:03:54-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:03:54):**  makes and that I've learned to emphasize in all the projects that I work with as well.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:03:59):**  This is one of my favorite chats from this series and I hope it encourages you to reflect  
**[0:04:02-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:04:02):**  and reevaluate as much as it did for me.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:04:05):**  So with that said, I'll hand things over to Celia.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:04:08):**  Hey Celia, thanks so much for being with me today.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:04:11):**  It's great to have you on the podcast.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:04:12):**  How are things going with you?  
**[0:04:14-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:04:14):**  My pleasure.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:04:15):**  It's a beautiful morning here in Aspen.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:04:18):**  So yeah, very nice.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:04:19):**  Happy to be here.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:04:20):**  Now I'm surprised to hear that you're so far away from the shore side since you're mostly  
**[0:04:25-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:04:25):**  known for your work with the Marine Foundation and coral reefs.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:04:29):**  What brought you out there?  
**[0:04:31-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:04:31):**  Well I met my husband in Bali when I was working in Bali, which is where I did a lot of my  
**[0:04:35-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:04:35):**  work in Indonesia.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:04:38):**  And then we came back to Aspen.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:04:40):**  He's an architect here and I'm an artist.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:04:45):**  My involvement in marine conservation comes from an art perspective.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:04:49):**  My partner was scientist.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:04:50):**  So coming here, I just continued with my design career.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:04:56):**  But still very active in marine conservation.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:05:00):**  I'm presently partnered with Fabien Cousteau, who I'm thrilled to be working with, who I  
**[0:05:04-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:05:04):**  met up here actually.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:05:06):**  So I find that fun that I would meet one of my heroes again so far away from the sea.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:05:12):**  But it has been very interesting for me to be away from the sea, obviously engaging in  
**[0:05:19-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:05:19):**  ocean issues close to the oceans fairly easy.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:05:23):**  But I was very interested in how people related to the ocean when they're not close to it.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:05:29):**  So it's been an interesting learning curve for me in that sense.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:05:33):**  It's a very important key to kind of connect in with all of this.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:05:37):**  And tell me, how did your passion for the care of coral and ocean ecosystems begin?  
**[0:05:43-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:05:43):**  Like you said, you consider yourself mostly an artist.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:05:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:05:48):**  So I mean, I've always been passionate about conservation.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:05:53):**  I grew up gardening and living in the land.  
**[0:05:56-0:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:05:56):**  I was very fortunate to be able to kind of have that lovely relationship with nature  
**[0:05:59-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:05:59):**  as a child.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:06:00):**  So I always found it a great inspiration for me.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:06:04):**  My love of nature fuels my creativity.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:06:07):**  I mean, I essentially believe everything here on this planet is creating, you know, whether  
**[0:06:12-0:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:06:12):**  that's a flower or an artist.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:06:16):**  And I started to scuba dive.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:06:17):**  That was actually really what kind of got me really involved.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:06:20):**  I started to scuba dive and surf and spend more time by the sea.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:06:23):**  But really, it was my scuba diving that enabled me to go under the water and see what was  
**[0:06:29-0:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:06:29):**  happening close at hand.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:06:32):**  Coral reefs are very pretty.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:06:33):**  So when you dive, it's one of the great attractions.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:06:36):**  But I was also at the same time able to see, you know, what was happening and how the decline  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:06:41):**  in the ocean health was occurring.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:06:45):**  But then equally was able to learn about artificial reef technology and the techniques of coral  
**[0:06:49-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:06:49):**  gardening and, you know, creating habitat for fish and the whole kind of marine conservation  
**[0:06:55-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:06:55):**  approach, marine protected areas.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:06:58):**  And certainly here was a manmade object that was going into the sea that now was serving  
**[0:07:04-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:07:04):**  a purpose that was positive.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:07:07):**  And I love the fact that people got kind of so excited about like a shipwreck when they  
**[0:07:11-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:07:11):**  dived.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:07:12):**  And I was really able to see how people loved that kind of storyline.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:07:16):**  And I just saw the scope really for kind of merging art and conservation.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:07:20):**  And that's really how it all started was this desire to now take my art and make something  
**[0:07:26-0:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:07:26):**  that had a kind of dual purpose and wasn't just a visual thing was now actually, you  
**[0:07:31-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:07:31):**  know, doing good.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:07:33):**  So that's really how my passion started.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:07:35):**  Well, so let's break it down as to how you came about creating artwork for marine ecosystems  
**[0:07:41-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:07:41):**  and how they play a bigger role in the health and the rejuvenation of coral reefs specifically.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:07:49):**  I mean, yeah, it started, I mean, it started really, I mean, it started really, I think,  
**[0:07:53-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:07:53):**  as I say, when you dive, one of the great attractions is a shipwreck.  
**[0:07:57-0:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:07:57):**  And people love to go and dive the shipwrecks.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:07:59):**  And, you know, the moment you put anything in the sea, that's animals are looking essentially  
**[0:08:04-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:08:04):**  for somewhere to kind of hide, they're looking for somewhere to attach to.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:08:07):**  So, you know, the moment you put something in the ocean, things will kind of congregate  
**[0:08:11-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:08:11):**  around it.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:08:12):**  But people particularly noticed that these metal structures, corals were settling on  
**[0:08:15-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:08:15):**  them and they, you know, they'd become very vibrant and alive.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:08:21):**  And so I found myself meeting scientists and meeting, you know, local conservationists,  
**[0:08:26-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:08:26):**  people that were starting to explore ways to help regenerate the reefs and the coral  
**[0:08:31-0:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:08:31):**  reefs that were starting to suffer from lots of destructive things that were occurring.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:08:37):**  So on a very practical level, when I first started doing this, people were starting to  
**[0:08:42-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:08:42):**  explore coral gardening, this idea that we can, you know, our relationship to the sea  
**[0:08:49-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:08:49):**  up until that point was very destructive as well.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:08:51):**  You know, we just took things out, we take the fish out, we just took what we wanted.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:08:56):**  But now we're through coral gardening and creating marine protected areas, you start  
**[0:09:01-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:09:01):**  to have a more positive relationship to the sea where actually we're kind of cultivating  
**[0:09:05-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:09:05):**  something good.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:09:07):**  So with my artworks, what I was trying to do is, you know, you stop fishermen from fishing  
**[0:09:12-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:09:12):**  and things like this.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:09:14):**  You know, these people need a livelihood.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:09:16):**  So you can't really do successful conservation unless you address the economics of the community  
**[0:09:23-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:09:23):**  that depend on it.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:09:24):**  So by exploring and working with ecotourism and merging the scientific ideas with art,  
**[0:09:33-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:09:33):**  we now create this kind of very beautiful interface where people can kind of dive and  
**[0:09:38-0:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:09:38):**  experience these artworks and, you know, have a very positive interaction with the natural  
**[0:09:45-0:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:09:45):**  environment.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:09:46):**  Maybe, you know, I mean, everybody was always very much like, oh, you just should leave  
**[0:09:49-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:09:49):**  it natural.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:09:50):**  But there's lots of places in the world that no longer kind of are natural anymore.  
**[0:09:54-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:09:54):**  So the work that we do with the community, with scientists, with artists helps create  
**[0:10:00-0:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:10:00):**  new economy whilst kind of creating a motivation to look after the sea, meanwhile supporting  
**[0:10:07-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:10:07):**  activities and scientists in learning what best practice is really in terms of coral  
**[0:10:11-0:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:10:11):**  propagation, coral gardening.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:10:14):**  And give me a little bit of a timeline about how this came together, because I'm sure listeners  
**[0:10:18-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:10:18):**  are going to be curious as to, okay, so you've got the idea of putting something in the ocean  
**[0:10:23-0:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:10:23):**  that acts as sort of a seed for coral to grab on to and to start to regenerate the lost  
**[0:10:30-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:10:30):**  ecosystem that was there.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:10:33):**  And how did this come into the Marine Foundation and the necessary elements to turn it into  
**[0:10:40-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:10:40):**  something that could look for funding and get the resources necessary to do projects?  
**[0:10:46-0:10:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:10:46):**  I mean, I always worked with local communities in areas where they've already are already  
**[0:10:54-0:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:10:54):**  looking to do an environmental endeavor.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:10:58):**  I mean, I helped people set things up, but it was always with local partners.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:11:01):**  So I was always looking for I mean, I worked with Coral Reef Alliance in Indonesia and  
**[0:11:07-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:11:07):**  Coral Triangle and Coral, you know, local people, so they were working with the local  
**[0:11:12-0:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:11:12):**  communities already.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:11:14):**  And I saw some of them already had existing coral gardening programs.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:11:19):**  So, you know, different places were using different techniques.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:11:21):**  So for example, one of the scientific methods that I've worked a lot with is bio rock.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:11:26):**  And it's a scientist out of America.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:11:28):**  And that's a technique where they actually use a mild electrical current to help enhance  
**[0:11:33-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:11:33):**  coral growth.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:11:35):**  And this is a transplanting technique where we actually take little bits of coral and  
**[0:11:39-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:11:39):**  actually plant them specifically on the sculptures.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:11:43):**  Other techniques are more like where we use natural settling.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:11:46):**  So we would use like reef bowl ideas where we create habitat for fish and then things  
**[0:11:51-0:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:11:51):**  naturally settle on them.  
**[0:11:54-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:11:54):**  In terms of getting funding, it was more, you know, the ecotourism hotel sponsoring  
**[0:12:00-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:12:00):**  it.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:12:01):**  And trying to kind of I mean, it wasn't necessarily the easiest model for funding because, you  
**[0:12:05-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:12:05):**  know, when you're creating an art piece, there's probably those art pieces are going to be  
**[0:12:09-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:12:09):**  more expensive than maybe just putting like a coral table in.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:12:12):**  So sometimes it was a little bit challenging to kind of persuade people to go for that  
**[0:12:16-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:12:16):**  kind of added value.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:12:17):**  But, you know, in terms of raising awareness, that was really how we were able to kind of  
**[0:12:25-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:12:25):**  get the funding in terms of raising awareness, you know, enabling communities to bring artists  
**[0:12:31-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:12:31):**  in to create positive stories.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:12:37):**  And you know, the idea that, you know, you could help put money into ecotourism, help  
**[0:12:41-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:12:41):**  people make a living through becoming divers and tour guides.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:12:46):**  And then in that way, helping a new generation kind of move away from, you know, doing fishing  
**[0:12:52-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:12:52):**  and extractive kind of methods.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:12:56):**  But yeah, the funding model funding is always challenging with environmental projects.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:13:00):**  I have to say.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:13:02):**  Yeah, it's something that I hear a ton from the clients and the projects that I've worked  
**[0:13:06-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:13:06):**  with in the past.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:13:07):**  And this is one of the reasons why I wanted to reach out to you is because what I can't  
**[0:13:12-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:13:12):**  figure out is if you had sort of a general plan in the beginning of how all of these  
**[0:13:15-0:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:13:15):**  pieces fit together from reaching out to the community, to the ecosystem, sort of services  
**[0:13:22-0:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:13:22):**  that would come out of the project, the artwork itself and the funding model.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:13:26):**  Or if as you got into these places and came up with a preliminary idea, be it the art  
**[0:13:32-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:13:32):**  installation going into the damaged ecosystems, you then formed the other pieces around it  
**[0:13:38-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:13:38):**  as you understood the community and the resources available as it was kind of maturing and moving  
**[0:13:44-0:13:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:13:44):**  forward.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:13:45):**  Yeah, I mean, I'd always been passionate about ocean issues, particularly actually my first  
**[0:13:51-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:13:51):**  interest kind of was back in the day was kind of dolphins and how they were kind of catching  
**[0:13:57-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:13:57):**  dolphins in the tuna nets.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:13:59):**  And that they made me aware of how mass fishing was, you know, had massive by catchers.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:14:06):**  And so it was a subject that I was kind of exploring, but it was certainly when I started  
**[0:14:09-0:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:14:09):**  diving that really something opened up for me.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:14:15):**  I think when I first started my scuba diving, my dive instructor was like could tell that  
**[0:14:18-0:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:14:18):**  I was seeing the world differently, like from an artistic perspective, you know, it's a  
**[0:14:23-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:14:23):**  very stimulating, very beautiful world down there.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:14:29):**  So yeah, I mean, I think like any artists know, it certainly wasn't something I had  
**[0:14:33-0:14:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:14:33):**  a clear idea about.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:14:35):**  It started as a passion.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:14:38):**  You know, I just would dive around the world.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:14:40):**  I found myself on boats, meeting scientists.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:14:43):**  And so it was just something that I explored.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:14:48):**  And I had spent a lot of time in Indonesia, so I'd heard of coral conservation projects.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:14:53):**  I'd then go and visit these places and get to know the team and just see what they were  
**[0:14:58-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:14:58):**  doing.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:14:59):**  And basically what I did notice is that it was very scientific.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:15:02):**  You know, they were just putting these kind of pretty basic structures in the water.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:15:06):**  So yeah, I mean, initially I was the one putting money in, you know, I paid paid, you know,  
**[0:15:12-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:15:12):**  to do courses.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:15:13):**  And I was on a course in the Gili Islands where they ran a big BioRock course, you know,  
**[0:15:19-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:15:19):**  for like 30 people.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:15:20):**  I joined it and got to know the head of Gili EcoTrust, lovely lady called Delphine Robby,  
**[0:15:27-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:15:27):**  who's done amazing work there.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:15:29):**  And I presented the idea to her and said, if we're just putting these fairly, you know,  
**[0:15:35-0:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:15:35):**  basic structures in the water, how do you think people would feel about, you know, if  
**[0:15:37-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:15:37):**  we made one of these structures into like, to look like a manta ray or a turtle?  
**[0:15:41-0:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:15:41):**  And she was like, well, if you can persuade our sponsors, their sponsors with the hotels  
**[0:15:45-0:15:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:15:45):**  and restaurants on the island, then if they're happy for you to do it, then go for it.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:15:51):**  So we did.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:15:52):**  That was how the first one happened.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:15:54):**  And when I was there, I was working with, you know, other experts from around Indonesia  
**[0:15:59-0:16:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:15:59):**  and they were like, wow, they hadn't really thought about making a turtle or making sculptures  
**[0:16:02-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:16:02):**  out of these things.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:16:03):**  So they then went back to some of their projects that they were doing.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:16:07):**  And then specifically one in Bali, in Pemuta, in the northwest of Bali.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:16:14):**  And I met a lady there and she was like, what would you like to do here?  
**[0:16:17-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:16:17):**  So then that was how the Coral Goddess was born, you know, all done very grassroots funding.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:16:25):**  And people who just kind of connected to my passion and, you know, people had small kind  
**[0:16:31-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:16:31):**  of funds that they could allocate.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:16:32):**  And then a lot was given in kind, hotels, boats, diving equipment, you know, huge amounts  
**[0:16:36-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:16:36):**  of stuff was given in kind.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:16:38):**  So we were able to do a lot of it on just very little money.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:16:40):**  I mean, I really believe that the languaging that I learned during this stuff was, you  
**[0:16:46-0:16:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:16:46):**  know, very different from the normal business, fiscal conversation that kind of dominates  
**[0:16:53-0:16:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:16:53):**  present business.  
**[0:16:54-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:16:54):**  You know, it's kind of very obsessional about money going in, money coming out, you know,  
**[0:17:00-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:17:00):**  people aren't really, we're beginning to, but we still haven't, hasn't become mainstream  
**[0:17:04-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:17:04):**  enough where we start to value things in our life, not based solely on how much it's worth  
**[0:17:09-0:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:17:09):**  on a money perspective.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:17:10):**  You know, we have to start observing what we can get from, not what we can get, but  
**[0:17:17-0:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:17:17):**  what life is offering us that isn't about money, you know, fresh water, clean water,  
**[0:17:21-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:17:21):**  good ecosystems.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:17:22):**  But certainly once I had worked with people and I was working with scientists, people  
**[0:17:27-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:17:27):**  became interested in what I was doing.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:17:29):**  And so, you know, I would be given opportunities to talk, people would then offer to become  
**[0:17:35-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:17:35):**  part of little fundraising things that I was doing in the community.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:17:39):**  I was able to win some grants because, you know, proof of concept started to kind of  
**[0:17:43-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:17:43):**  evolve out of it, but no, certainly the languaging, what we were doing was evolved as I learned,  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:17:51):**  but I mean, I was, I'm, I'm, I was involved and I'm involved in a field and it's more  
**[0:17:56-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:17:56):**  mainstream now, but when we were starting, it was very much kind of innovative.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:17:59):**  So the language was being created as we were doing the projects.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:18:04):**  I really agree with that need to find new value systems instead of always thinking about  
**[0:18:10-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:18:10):**  the profits that would come out financially.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:18:12):**  And I would imagine that that was easier to communicate to the people who were living  
**[0:18:16-0:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:18:16):**  in the area and directly involved in the ecosystems that were being changed and the economies  
**[0:18:22-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:18:22):**  that were being transformed as a result.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:18:25):**  Can you tell me a bit about how the engagement with the community was vital to getting these  
**[0:18:30-0:18:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:18:30):**  projects established?  
**[0:18:31-0:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:18:31):**  Yeah, I mean, Bali, Bali, which is, as I say, where I ended up working a lot was, is a very  
**[0:18:36-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:18:36):**  interesting, has a very interesting community structure.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:18:39):**  So I was learning from them as much as I was contributing to them.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:18:43):**  You know, in fact, the exchange was, was, was valuable both ways in the sense that they  
**[0:18:49-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:18:49):**  have a wonderful sense of community and certainly aren't super money orientated.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:18:56):**  And in fact, they in Bali, they blessed the sculptures before they go into the water,  
**[0:19:01-0:19:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:19:01):**  which is super magical.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:19:03):**  What I was able to, you know, but then a lot of the fishermen that they're actually scared  
**[0:19:07-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:19:07):**  of the water, they have kind of cultures that are scared of the water.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:19:09):**  So even though they fish on top of the water, very few, very few of them will ever actually  
**[0:19:14-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:19:14):**  swim or certainly dive down.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:19:16):**  So you know, by coming to them with these sculptures and then kind of seeing these sculptures,  
**[0:19:23-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:19:23):**  kind of seeing them being sunk was, you know, as a, was a fascinating way for them to kind  
**[0:19:27-0:19:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:19:27):**  of start to open up their perspective on, on, on the ocean and how, you know, these  
**[0:19:33-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:19:33):**  Westerners were kind of coming in and valuing it.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:19:35):**  I think that's bringing these sculptures in and obviously caring.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:19:39):**  I think that really helped them shift their sense of perception and value towards the  
**[0:19:45-0:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:19:45):**  water.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:19:48):**  And certainly, you know, I would work with one community and then they would have a project  
**[0:19:52-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:19:52):**  in for several years and I could get them to come and speak to the other communities  
**[0:19:57-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:19:57):**  and explain to them that, you know, these things take a little bit of time to mature,  
**[0:20:02-0:20:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:20:02):**  but, you know, the investments are worth it.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:20:06):**  And I think that was also very helpful having, you know, like a leader of one community because  
**[0:20:10-0:20:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:20:10):**  they have these kind of structured leaderships and, you know, you have these kind of take  
**[0:20:14-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:20:14):**  the pillars of respect within the community and then they go and speak to the other communities.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:20:18):**  That was super valuable.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:20:23):**  Building community is definitely, you know, for me, a lot of what these projects were  
**[0:20:29-0:20:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:20:29):**  about, you know, in terms of the sculptures and the very realities of actually getting  
**[0:20:36-0:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:20:36):**  these pieces, as I say, funded and put in the water and managed was a brilliant way  
**[0:20:40-0:20:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:20:40):**  of bringing different sectors together that might not have communicated with each other  
**[0:20:45-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:20:45):**  and previously because definitely working together is really, you know, another key  
**[0:20:53-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:20:53):**  thing that we need to learn to do more effectively.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:20:56):**  There's a lot of ego in communities.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:21:00):**  It's just, you know, lots of bizarre things come up to try and stop stuff from happening.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:21:05):**  We kind of really like to bicker lots and, you know, feel important and that can actually  
**[0:21:10-0:21:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:21:10):**  stop stuff from happening, which is interesting.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:21:12):**  Well, give me some examples of some of the things that came up that threatened to stop  
**[0:21:16-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:21:16):**  or stall the project and perhaps some ideas or ways that you found to get past them or  
**[0:21:22-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:21:22):**  move through them with the entire community and support.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:21:25):**  I mean, for me, I mean, unless you're I mean, you know, you're going to approach these projects  
**[0:21:31-0:21:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:21:31):**  one of two ways.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:21:32):**  You're either going to be very established in the community that you're working and you're  
**[0:21:36-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:21:36):**  coming through this as a member of your own community, wanting to start a project in your  
**[0:21:39-0:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:21:39):**  own community and in your own community.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:21:43):**  That wasn't necessarily how I was working with another community that I wasn't part  
**[0:21:48-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:21:48):**  of that I got to know, but I was essentially, I wasn't born and bred in Bali.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:21:52):**  Do you know what I mean?  
**[0:21:53-0:22:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:21:53):**  So I would always find local NGOs or local figureheads that had already established a  
**[0:22:03-0:22:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:22:03):**  very good placement within that community.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:22:06):**  So that was key for me, you know, because I was, you know, the Marine Foundation isn't  
**[0:22:12-0:22:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:22:12):**  a managing body.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:22:14):**  We offer our creativity, we offer up projects, we come in with kind of new ideas and energy  
**[0:22:19-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:22:19):**  and then a kind of an international connection out.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:22:23):**  So you know, suddenly you've got a local community in Bali that through me is now their projects  
**[0:22:28-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:22:28):**  now being seen in London magazines or being talked about in America.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:22:33):**  So I provide that access from local to international.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:22:38):**  But yeah, I think if you're in your own community, then obviously that's very different.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:22:44):**  You know, you, I mean, trying to get, you're always going to meet opposition.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:22:49):**  This is just the interesting thing.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:22:50):**  There's always going to be somebody that's probably going to disagree with what you do.  
**[0:22:53-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:22:53):**  But yeah, you've got to rally, you know, you've just got to kind of rally up people that support  
**[0:23:00-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:23:00):**  you, you know.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:23:01):**  You're not going to admit something's not going to really happen if you're doing it  
**[0:23:04-0:23:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:23:04):**  on your own.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:23:05):**  It's going to be very, very hard work and you don't really want to because this is really  
**[0:23:08-0:23:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:23:08):**  about kind of group consensus in many ways, you know.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:23:12):**  Yeah, you mentioned two things that I really agree with.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:23:14):**  One that you're never going to get any project done without some opposition.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:23:19):**  And rather than seeing it as an obstacle or hurdle, rather that it's a part of the journey,  
**[0:23:24-0:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:23:24):**  it's a part of the process.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:23:26):**  And figuring out how to overcome those things not only strengthens the resolve around the  
**[0:23:32-0:23:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:23:32):**  people who are committed to them, but can also help you to identify some really key  
**[0:23:36-0:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:23:36):**  weaknesses or some problems that you might not have seen if everyone was like, yeah,  
**[0:23:40-0:23:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:23:40):**  let's just do this on principle, you know.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:23:42):**  And it gives you that little extra reason to take a critical look at whatever your project  
**[0:23:47-0:23:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:23:47):**  is.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:23:48):**  You know, yeah, I mean, I think we're looking at, you know, we don't always, as an individual,  
**[0:23:52-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:23:52):**  you don't always know best, you know, and to be able to hear other people's opinions  
**[0:23:57-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:23:57):**  and perspectives is really vital.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:24:00):**  You know, people really want to be heard.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:24:03):**  So you know, I mean, the way that I was doing these projects, as I said, wasn't hugely money  
**[0:24:08-0:24:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:24:08):**  driven, you know, so I would see, I mean, I'm going to focus on marine conservation,  
**[0:24:12-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:24:12):**  but you know, you'd see marine parks being set up and you'd see, you know, international  
**[0:24:17-0:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:24:17):**  NGOs bringing huge amounts of money in to set up that marine park in one way.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:24:21):**  That's great.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:24:22):**  You know, here you've got all this money coming in, but then with that money becomes a gender  
**[0:24:26-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:24:26):**  and goals.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:24:29):**  And these might not, these may have been written by somebody who didn't even know that community,  
**[0:24:34-0:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:24:34):**  you know, plus what you'd see a lot is that then when the money ran out, these kind of  
**[0:24:39-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:24:39):**  organizing bodies would kind of disappear and the communities hadn't been empowered.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:24:44):**  And in many ways you could say that this money was inefficiently spent actually causing potentially  
**[0:24:50-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:24:50):**  quite a lot of annoyance and people don't really like these people just coming in and  
**[0:24:54-0:25:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:24:54):**  telling them what to do, you know, or you, you know, you kind of galvanize support and  
**[0:25:02-0:25:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:25:02):**  you know, get people involved and, you know, by working in kind a lot and not paying, not  
**[0:25:08-0:25:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:25:08):**  all being about money is that people offered up their services willingly, you know, offered  
**[0:25:13-0:25:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:25:13):**  that up in exchange for doing this project.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:25:18):**  And I mean, I was always amazed at how things came together.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:25:21):**  It was like a real gift in terms of seeing a different way things can unfold, that success  
**[0:25:29-0:25:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:25:29):**  can be achieved without necessarily having to throw money at that, you know, because  
**[0:25:34-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:25:34):**  the moment you throw money at people, you know, it's a different dynamic.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:25:37):**  So that was just a great gift.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:25:38):**  So I think, you know, exploring, I mean, obviously money is a, is a huge way of making things  
**[0:25:45-0:25:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:25:45):**  happen, making things happen when you don't have huge amounts of money is also possible.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:25:50):**  It just is done in a very different way and potentially more organic way and a potentially  
**[0:25:55-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:25:55):**  more inclusive way.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:25:57):**  So that's just an interesting perspective.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:26:01):**  Yeah, I completely agree.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:26:03):**  And from my own experiences working on projects around the world, the Philippines, Guatemala  
**[0:26:09-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:26:09):**  more recently, Senegal, especially, that kind of rings true.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:26:13):**  And it makes me think that there are a lot more commonalities around world cultures and  
**[0:26:17-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:26:17):**  communities than there are differences just because like you mentioned, you know, you  
**[0:26:21-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:26:21):**  can throw money at a problem and it can get a lot of things done.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:26:25):**  But sometimes when you take a little bit of the longer way and work towards community  
**[0:26:30-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:26:30):**  adoption of a project even though it can take quite a bit longer and it can be much more  
**[0:26:35-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:26:35):**  challenging, it not only will help you to kind of grow in your own way as far as filling  
**[0:26:42-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:26:42):**  out the project and making sure that it is inclusive to the people that it is involving,  
**[0:26:47-0:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:26:47):**  but it's much more likely to be longer lasting and something that people help to maintain  
**[0:26:52-0:26:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:26:52):**  once it gets established because of taking those extra steps.  
**[0:26:55-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:26:55):**  I think that seems pretty key to what you've been effective in getting these projects done  
**[0:27:01-0:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:27:01):**  in these places.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:27:02):**  Yeah, I mean, you want to see it.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:27:04):**  I mean, conservation is about the land and animals and ecosystems.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:27:09):**  But the reason that being destroyed is because of human beings.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:27:13):**  And so, you know, having worked in the field for a while, enabling change is much, much  
**[0:27:21-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:27:21):**  more complicated than we really, you know, that we're only really it's just it's just  
**[0:27:27-0:27:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:27:27):**  amazing.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:27:28):**  You know, you think that people would evolve and change quickly once they know that what  
**[0:27:31-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:27:31):**  they're doing is destructive.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:27:32):**  It just it's not quite how it works, you know.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:27:36):**  So yeah, getting people really involved and to really care and, you know, to have an investment  
**[0:27:44-0:27:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:27:44):**  in that when everything is so twinkling and tantalizing in the modern world.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:27:49):**  That's a really good point.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:27:52):**  And I always worry that one of the things that makes it so easy to continue to damage  
**[0:27:57-0:28:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:27:57):**  ecosystems is that with every new generation, there's something of a loss of understanding  
**[0:28:02-0:28:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:28:02):**  of what the ecosystems were like before they were as damaged as they were.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:28:07):**  And we start to lose our reference as to what a really healthy ecosystem in our immediate  
**[0:28:12-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:28:12):**  surroundings can look like.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:28:13):**  And perhaps we start to romanticize it in other places far away that we think of as,  
**[0:28:18-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:28:18):**  you know, maybe conservation spots where people don't interact with nearly as much and start  
**[0:28:23-0:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:28:23):**  to think that where we live is is open for destruction.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:28:26):**  And that's just a part of the way that we interact with it.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:28:29):**  Yeah, I mean, I can think of one funny story, which is that, you know, you know, again,  
**[0:28:35-0:28:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:28:35):**  Westerners go to like places like Bali and, you know, we want to stay in these kind of  
**[0:28:38-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:28:38):**  natural organic hotels and bathe under the stars.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:28:42):**  And then the Indonesians are like, no, I grew up like give me air conditioning and TV.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:28:48):**  You know, yes.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:28:49):**  I mean, you know, you are in danger of kind of that's a really good point of kind of romanticizing  
**[0:28:54-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:28:54):**  that and thinking that because of, you know, here you are living in some kind of urban  
**[0:28:57-0:29:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:28:57):**  environment, maybe that you want to go to these kind of, you know, these parts of the  
**[0:29:01-0:29:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:29:01):**  world and you kind of romanticize and they don't even want to live like that.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:29:04):**  So that's one thing that's fascinating.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:29:07):**  I mean, that goes right along with my own experiences as a natural builder in the early  
**[0:29:13-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:29:13):**  years when I started doing this, like I was talking about working in Senegal before and  
**[0:29:16-0:29:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:29:16):**  we were building mud homes.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:29:19):**  And you know, when you go out into the rural areas, they're everywhere.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:29:22):**  And it's how most people still live in their quality buildings.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:29:25):**  But in the neighborhood where we were at, which was on the outskirts of Dakar, everybody  
**[0:29:30-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:29:30):**  would come by and like, why are you still building with mud?  
**[0:29:33-0:29:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:29:33):**  We've moved past that.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:29:34):**  We're building with cement now.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:29:36):**  And it's really it's a perception thing as much as anything, even if, you know, they  
**[0:29:40-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:29:40):**  struggle with quality of, you know, airflow or thermal capacity and cement buildings that  
**[0:29:46-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:29:46):**  just turn into ovens in the summer.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:29:48):**  Yeah, it's still seen as some some form of progress.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:29:52):**  Yeah, I guess in some ways it certainly is.  
**[0:29:55-0:29:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:29:55):**  It's still this is it.  
**[0:29:56-0:30:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:29:56):**  I mean, I'm actually recently I'm starting to really observe.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:30:03):**  Like the goal orientated world that we've become so familiar with, I think is impacting,  
**[0:30:09-0:30:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:30:09):**  you know, how we interact with our environment on a moment to moment basis.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:30:13):**  And I and I think that is massive in terms of, you know, our relationships, the ecosystem.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:30:21):**  And I think we kind of I've noticed more that when you're when you're very goal orientated,  
**[0:30:27-0:30:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:30:27):**  you know, you're you're pushing strive towards that goal.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:30:30):**  Getting to that goal becomes more important really than then, as you say, maybe dealing  
**[0:30:34-0:30:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:30:34):**  with somebody that needs to be dealt with sensitively in that moment.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:30:37):**  You know, it's like, well, I can't deal with you right now.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:30:39):**  I've got this agenda to me.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:30:41):**  You know, I've got a deadline.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:30:42):**  And and I'm starting to see, you know, that, you know, and then then then that all becomes  
**[0:30:47-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:30:47):**  justified with all I have to make money.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:30:48):**  I've got I mean, you know, I've got I mean, then people have real ones in terms of having  
**[0:30:51-0:30:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:30:51):**  to feed my families.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:30:53):**  I mean, I think of a really good example of just how distorted that becomes as an embodied  
**[0:30:58-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:30:58):**  that in East Asia, that for a long time had a technique of dynamiting, catching fish by  
**[0:31:03-0:31:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:31:03):**  dynamiting.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:31:04):**  So this is a strategy where they got dynamite.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:31:07):**  It was cheaper to get dynamite than it was to get fishing nets.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:31:11):**  And so they would throw the dynamite into the ocean and damage reef, potentially damage  
**[0:31:17-0:31:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:31:17):**  themselves.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:31:18):**  And then they would collect a very small percentage of the fish that died.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:31:22):**  And, you know, by bringing it to the surface, I mean, you know, I would come in and be like  
**[0:31:28-0:31:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:31:28):**  very judgmental of that.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:31:29):**  But then I was like, gosh, I mean, you know, when you start to think about what is motivating  
**[0:31:32-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:31:32):**  this person to do that, I mean, clearly poverty is motivating that person, you know, a desire  
**[0:31:40-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:31:40):**  to make money immediately.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:31:43):**  So yeah, I think we've had a massive shift in how the human mind works, what the human  
**[0:31:49-0:31:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:31:49):**  mind's focus is.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:31:50):**  It's happened in a fairly short period of time.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:31:52):**  I think it's accelerating even more so now in places, for example, you know, even though  
**[0:31:58-0:32:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:31:58):**  something like Europe has been kind of developing or evolving for hundreds of years, places  
**[0:32:03-0:32:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:32:03):**  like Asia, for example, I mean, you know, their lifestyles have changed drastically  
**[0:32:07-0:32:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:32:07):**  and kind of under half a century, you know, going from living very rural lives in somewhere  
**[0:32:13-0:32:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:32:13):**  like Bali to now kind of being a massive hotel, resort destination, you know, plastics, just  
**[0:32:18-0:32:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:32:18):**  insane impacts that they just don't really know how to deal with.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:32:23):**  And then, I mean, I think as it becomes, your environment becomes almost more unpleasant,  
**[0:32:26-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:32:26):**  aren't you then going to kind of seek comfort even more and kind of material things, you  
**[0:32:30-0:32:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:32:30):**  know, so it becomes kind of an escalating vicious circle, I think.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:32:36):**  Yeah.  
**[0:32:37-0:32:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:32:37):**  I mean, I've seen so many examples of that and heard of them around the world to everything  
**[0:32:40-0:32:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:32:40):**  from, you know, deforestation in tropical areas being fueled by people who are making  
**[0:32:45-0:32:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:32:45):**  the smallest amount of money from it.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:32:47):**  And, you know, there's just, there's countless examples of this and it seems to be fueled  
**[0:32:52-0:32:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:32:52):**  by this mindset of scarcity, which is not, it's not only present in what we would consider  
**[0:32:59-0:33:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:32:59):**  poor communities.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:33:00):**  And one of the things that I'm constantly trying to look for in the projects that I  
**[0:33:04-0:33:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:33:04):**  advise on and the ones that I help to promote is the aspect of the project that helps to  
**[0:33:09-0:33:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:33:09):**  reduce that mindset of scarcity and that urgency of needing to make the most of whatever small  
**[0:33:15-0:33:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:33:15):**  resources are available at the moment.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:33:18):**  Because having the luxury of a longer term vision and a feeling of security is really  
**[0:33:23-0:33:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:33:23):**  where being able to put your efforts into longer term visions and goals and invest in  
**[0:33:29-0:33:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:33:29):**  a future stems from.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:33:32):**  And it really seems to me like through these projects by putting in these art installations  
**[0:33:37-0:33:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:33:37):**  that, I mean, you have to be careful to go down and see it requires some equipment, it  
**[0:33:42-0:33:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:33:42):**  requires some looking, it requires some planning.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:33:45):**  Those come as kind of emergent properties of future thinking and investment in what  
**[0:33:51-0:33:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:33:51):**  is going to be of value in the future as kind of the aspect of the projects that seems to  
**[0:33:58-0:34:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:33:58):**  really resonate and connect with community.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:34:01):**  Have you seen that in practice as well?  
**[0:34:03-0:34:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:34:03):**  Yeah, I mean, I think just yeah, I mean, I think to rewind, I mean, I think what's happening  
**[0:34:09-0:34:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:34:09):**  in the world at the moment, especially with areas where there are wonderful eco resources  
**[0:34:14-0:34:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:34:14):**  is you have your local community, basically you've lived off that resource probably fairly  
**[0:34:19-0:34:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:34:19):**  successfully for a long time.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:34:22):**  But now international business pressures are destroying those habitats at a vast rate under  
**[0:34:30-0:34:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:34:30):**  the umbrella of making money and so now a local community is actually not able to support  
**[0:34:35-0:34:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:34:35):**  their family from their local resource.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:34:37):**  But yet it's all being justified by some kind of big making, I mean, palm oil for rainforest.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:34:44):**  I mean, we don't need to go any further.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:34:46):**  But meanwhile, that local person is seeing their habitat destroyed.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:34:49):**  And as you say, then we embark on the whole feeling of insecurity and fear that that in  
**[0:34:56-0:34:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:34:56):**  a very real way is going to impact that local community.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:34:59):**  So yeah, I mean, I think, you know, the work that we do by, you know, by reinvigorating  
**[0:35:06-0:35:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:35:06):**  a sense of place by, you know, people coming, you know, by allowing a local community to  
**[0:35:11-0:35:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:35:11):**  really do something wonderful with their local ecosystem and start to see how actually, if  
**[0:35:20-0:35:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:35:20):**  they invest in improving the health of that ecosystem, they now start to make money and  
**[0:35:27-0:35:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:35:27):**  see a healthy ecosystem.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:35:29):**  So we're starting to kind of, you know, bring together making money.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:35:35):**  I mean, it is relevant.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:35:36):**  People do need to make money, whether they're making money just through the physical money  
**[0:35:40-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:35:40):**  or a sense of value that they create in their local ecosystem that then makes people want  
**[0:35:45-0:35:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:35:45):**  to come and see that healthy ecosystem.  
**[0:35:47-0:35:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:35:47):**  I mean, that's what I really love.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:35:49):**  You know, now we're investing in something a bit more abstract, i.e. healthy ecosystem,  
**[0:35:54-0:36:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:35:54):**  small fish, healthy corals, art, you know, what I love about art is it's very of the  
**[0:36:01-0:36:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:36:01):**  moment, you know, people, you know, one of the reasons I explore using art as a visual  
**[0:36:07-0:36:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:36:07):**  languaging is that, you know, the intellect of the mind, you know, is limited and to a  
**[0:36:12-0:36:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:36:12):**  certain extent.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:36:13):**  And when you experience an artwork, you know, it inspires you, it brings you into the present  
**[0:36:19-0:36:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:36:19):**  moment, it basically helps reignite or strengthen that connection with the moment.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:36:25):**  So, yeah, I mean, we're just creating a little kind of super fun playground where people  
**[0:36:30-0:36:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:36:30):**  can enjoy yet the ripples out from that in the sense of making the community feel proud,  
**[0:36:36-0:36:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:36:36):**  you know, feeling that people want to come and be part of that, that we, you know, people  
**[0:36:42-0:36:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:36:42):**  are now respecting and admiring what they're doing.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:36:45):**  Yeah, I mean, it's just really beautiful to see really.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:36:49):**  Well, so tell me more about that.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:36:51):**  I'm sure you've kept in touch with the communities and the projects that you've installed in  
**[0:36:55-0:36:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:36:55):**  the past.  
**[0:36:56-0:37:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:36:56):**  Can you talk a little bit about how the relationship to those has grown and evolved since you've  
**[0:37:02-0:37:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:37:02):**  sort of moved on to different aspects of what you do and some of the benefits that it's  
**[0:37:09-0:37:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:37:09):**  brought to the community in its installation as well?  
**[0:37:13-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:37:13):**  I mean, my most the most successful project, I mean, I think, you know, I've done quite  
**[0:37:19-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:37:19):**  a few different projects and it's so fascinating because, yes, you know, just disappear like,  
**[0:37:25-0:37:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:37:25):**  you know, you kind of do a sculpture and it's not managed well.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:37:28):**  And it kind of, you know, you lose connection with that person and it just kind of disappears.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:37:32):**  You know, that for me is an example of an unsuccessful relationship, you know.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:37:37):**  So I have a few of those.  
**[0:37:38-0:37:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:37:38):**  And then I also have, you know, Pamutaran is my best.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:37:42):**  I mean, it's just such a best practice.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:37:46):**  And they have they have it's the location of their conservation project is very close  
**[0:37:51-0:37:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:37:51):**  to the beach.  
**[0:37:52-0:37:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:37:52):**  So, you know, nice, easy access.  
**[0:37:56-0:38:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:37:56):**  And they have a little center where some local guys have had an amazing career, really just  
**[0:38:00-0:38:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:38:00):**  building up from just being, you know, probably for fishermen families.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:38:06):**  And they've worked at this Biowalk center and built up a real reputation within the  
**[0:38:10-0:38:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:38:10):**  community.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:38:11):**  They've won awards.  
**[0:38:12-0:38:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:38:12):**  I mean, you know, it's rippled out so that they've now become spokespeople to projects  
**[0:38:19-0:38:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:38:19):**  throughout the rest of Indonesia.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:38:22):**  And yeah, I mean, just on a personal level, Kamon, who's the head of the center, I mean,  
**[0:38:29-0:38:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:38:29):**  he's formed a very good friendship with him, watching him kind of evolve and grow and,  
**[0:38:33-0:38:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:38:33):**  you know, be part of this project that not only has helped on a local level, but they've  
**[0:38:38-0:38:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:38:38):**  also been able to kind of spread that information out through the rest of Indonesia, which is  
**[0:38:42-0:38:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:38:42):**  a huge archipelago.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:38:43):**  And yeah, just being really lovely to kind of empower somebody else to kind of make change  
**[0:38:50-0:38:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:38:50):**  and do good.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:38:52):**  And so through that experience, what would you consider to be the most successful aspects  
**[0:38:58-0:39:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:38:58):**  that you hope to install with your projects that are sort of emergent properties of the  
**[0:39:05-0:39:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:39:05):**  effort of bringing community together around the project to begin with?  
**[0:39:10-0:39:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:39:10):**  Well, I think the most for me, the most important thing is, is first of all, you have to establish  
**[0:39:16-0:39:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:39:16):**  something called marine spatial planning.  
**[0:39:18-0:39:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:39:18):**  So this is a kind of new language, which is, I mean, in one way is the, you know, the ocean  
**[0:39:23-0:39:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:39:23):**  didn't belong to anybody.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:39:24):**  You know, it's kind of borderless, but now, you know, we do need to have some sense of  
**[0:39:28-0:39:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:39:28):**  planning.  
**[0:39:29-0:39:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:39:29):**  So first of all, marine spatial planning is that you kind of look at a body of water and,  
**[0:39:33-0:39:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:39:33):**  you know, analyze usage and basically designates, you know, well, if you're doing dredging there,  
**[0:39:40-0:39:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:39:40):**  you probably shouldn't do that, you know, but we will allow some kind of artisanal scallop  
**[0:39:44-0:39:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:39:44):**  fishing, for example, in England and here is going to be diving.  
**[0:39:47-0:39:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:39:47):**  But, you know, this area here, I want to know take zone.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:39:50):**  So for me, I always like to establish some form of marine protected area.  
**[0:39:54-0:39:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:39:54):**  I want an area where, you know, for a while everybody's committed to just leaving that  
**[0:39:58-0:40:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:39:58):**  area alone.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:40:00):**  And that's kind of like my starting point, really, you know, and then getting everybody  
**[0:40:05-0:40:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:40:05):**  to agree to that is just a really wonderful way of, you know, getting everybody to be  
**[0:40:10-0:40:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:40:10):**  kind of focused on that, you know, and some education needs to occur to the fishermen  
**[0:40:14-0:40:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:40:14):**  particularly that the understanding that by stopping fishing there, yes, they can't fish  
**[0:40:20-0:40:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:40:20):**  there for a while.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:40:21):**  Often there's not that much fish in these areas anyway now, so it's not super difficult,  
**[0:40:24-0:40:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:40:24):**  but, you know, you need that commitment.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:40:25):**  That's my kind of primary focus.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:40:29):**  That's a really good binding element, you know, and then and then yeah.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:40:32):**  And then, you know, you need to make sure whatever destructive practices that were occurring  
**[0:40:36-0:40:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:40:36):**  stop, you know, you can't really implement a conservation project until you stop the  
**[0:40:40-0:40:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:40:40):**  destructive techniques.  
**[0:40:41-0:40:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:40:41):**  It just doesn't seem to be much point.  
**[0:40:43-0:40:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:40:43):**  So in Asia, for example, they use they do a lot of something called cyanide fishing.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:40:48):**  So you want to make sure that that's not happening.  
**[0:40:52-0:40:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:40:52):**  And then you're going to need to kind of start to look at what the community needs as a consequence  
**[0:40:56-0:40:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:40:56):**  of those measures.  
**[0:40:57-0:40:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:40:57):**  I mean, you know, there will be people making money off cyanide fishing.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:40:59):**  How do you address that?  
**[0:41:02-0:41:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:41:02):**  So, you know, working for me, as I say, working with a good local body that managing that  
**[0:41:09-0:41:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:41:09):**  marine park is really vital as well.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:41:11):**  I need somebody there who's got good community relationships and can speak the language,  
**[0:41:18-0:41:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:41:18):**  you know, and they're the ones on the ground really dealing with the day to day issues.  
**[0:41:25-0:41:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:41:25):**  So, yeah, I mean, for me, the most important thing is to stop the destructive whatever  
**[0:41:29-0:41:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:41:29):**  destruction is happening to that ecosystem and then set up a kind of protective area  
**[0:41:34-0:41:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:41:34):**  that everybody's going to agree to and get your local community to be your best guardians.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:41:40):**  I'm very glad you brought that up, because I've definitely heard of and seen a lot of  
**[0:41:43-0:41:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:41:43):**  projects that try and get started before actually working on the root problem or removing it  
**[0:41:49-0:41:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:41:49):**  from creating more damage.  
**[0:41:51-0:41:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:41:51):**  And when you try and, I guess, stem the flow of something so large and destructive through  
**[0:41:59-0:42:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:41:59):**  some sort of Band-Aid method, it always ends up being sort of a no win some or it can be  
**[0:42:06-0:42:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:42:06):**  very discouraging.  
**[0:42:07-0:42:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:42:07):**  And I'm glad that you put the emphasis on, I guess, removing the destructive practice  
**[0:42:13-0:42:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:42:13):**  from the equation before you start to fix things.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:42:16):**  And I suppose with your experience and from what you've learned in these different  
**[0:42:21-0:42:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:42:21):**  projects, what advice would you give to someone who is maybe taking on a regenerative project,  
**[0:42:27-0:42:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:42:27):**  not necessarily working with ocean ecosystems, but any that involve a community like this?  
**[0:42:33-0:42:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:42:33):**  What advice would you give them on how to get started and perhaps some expectations  
**[0:42:37-0:42:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:42:37):**  to go in with to avoid disappointment or unnecessary difficulty?  
**[0:42:43-0:42:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:42:43):**  I think listen to your community.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:42:46):**  I mean, you know, some of the local older folk are going to know that habitat way better  
**[0:42:51-0:42:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:42:51):**  than you're going to know it, you know, so I think going in with an element of humility  
**[0:42:57-0:43:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:42:57):**  and a sense of openness, I'm not going in, I mean, going in with a desire to do whatever  
**[0:43:04-0:43:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:43:04):**  you're doing, but certainly to be open and this to listen and to allow people to be heard.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:43:12):**  Because essentially what you're going in and healing is not just if you just want to go  
**[0:43:16-0:43:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:43:16):**  and heal the ecosystem, going by yourself a massive lot of uninhabited land and manage  
**[0:43:20-0:43:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:43:20):**  an uninhabited plot of land.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:43:22):**  If you're going into a story, an ecosystem that has a relationship to people, that's  
**[0:43:25-0:43:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:43:25):**  what needs to be healed.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:43:27):**  The healing, the heat, the people need to be healed and their relationship that they're  
**[0:43:30-0:43:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:43:30):**  now experiencing, or they're now kind of implementing onto their environment needs to be healed.  
**[0:43:37-0:43:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:43:37):**  So you know, to restore an ecosystem, you need to restore the human relationship to  
**[0:43:44-0:43:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:43:44):**  the ecosystem and you'll probably find that there'll be some healing that needs to happen  
**[0:43:48-0:43:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:43:48):**  within that people community as well.  
**[0:43:52-0:43:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:43:52):**  So that would be my thought, you know, as I said, if you want to just do an ecosystem,  
**[0:43:55-0:43:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:43:55):**  don't go and get involved with people.  
**[0:43:56-0:44:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:43:56):**  You know, if you want to go and do one where there's a big relationship between the people  
**[0:44:00-0:44:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:44:00):**  and the land, you're going to have to address that probably even more than you, some even  
**[0:44:04-0:44:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:44:04):**  more than some of the, I mean, we pretty much know what we need to do to heal the land.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:44:10):**  We know what we need to do.  
**[0:44:11-0:44:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:44:11):**  You know, that's not really anything new there.  
**[0:44:15-0:44:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:44:15):**  How we do that is the challenge.  
**[0:44:16-0:44:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:44:16):**  So that's what we're still learning and exploring.  
**[0:44:21-0:44:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:44:21):**  That's wonderful advice.  
**[0:44:22-0:44:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:44:22):**  And Sita, before we wrap up, can you tell our listeners where they can find out more  
**[0:44:27-0:44:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:44:27):**  about the Marine Foundation and the rest of your work?  
**[0:44:31-0:44:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:44:31):**  Yes, well, we have a website, themarinefoundation.org.  
**[0:44:36-0:44:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:44:36):**  So you can go and check out projects there and photos and all the amazing stuff that  
**[0:44:40-0:44:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:44:40):**  we've done around the world.  
**[0:44:42-0:44:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:44:42):**  At the moment, I'm working with Fabian Cousteau.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:44:46):**  We're planning on doing an amazing project in Curacao.  
**[0:44:50-0:44:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:44:50):**  So we're fundraising for that at the moment.  
**[0:44:51-0:44:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:44:51):**  So that's through Fabian Cousteau, olc.org.  
**[0:44:57-0:45:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:44:57):**  I am going to be creating a new goddess sculpture.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:45:00):**  She's Yamaya.  
**[0:45:01-0:45:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:45:01):**  So she's an Afro-Caribbean goddess.  
**[0:45:04-0:45:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:45:04):**  I like to work with visual archetype, you know.  
**[0:45:08-0:45:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:45:08):**  So one of the reasons I love to do goddesses is the goddess comes from a time in human  
**[0:45:13-0:45:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:45:13):**  history where we had a much greater connection to nature and we revered that connection and  
**[0:45:19-0:45:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:45:19):**  honored what nature provided for us.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:45:21):**  And so she is going to be kind of a sentient.  
**[0:45:25-0:45:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:45:25):**  She's going to be positioned in this coral garden that we're going to be creating in  
**[0:45:28-0:45:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:45:28):**  Curacao where we are working with some pretty innovative techniques that Fabian is pioneering  
**[0:45:35-0:45:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:45:35):**  with a guy from the New York Aquarium called Justin Muir.  
**[0:45:40-0:45:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:45:40):**  So we're going to be working on some different ways of propagating corals.  
**[0:45:45-0:45:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:45:45):**  And then this is all part of a big fantastic vision that Fabian has of following on from  
**[0:45:51-0:45:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:45:51):**  his grandfather's legacy of placing, you know, creating an underwater lab, Proteus.  
**[0:45:57-0:46:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:45:57):**  So this will also be located in Curacao, but obviously deeper and much more inaccessible  
**[0:46:04-0:46:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:46:04):**  than the coral garden in the sculpture project that I'm working on.  
**[0:46:07-0:46:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:46:07):**  So that's where we're really at at the moment.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:46:10):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:11-0:46:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:46:11):**  And always looking for new partners and new projects around the world.  
**[0:46:16-0:46:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:46:16):**  So I always invite anybody who wants to speak to me and communicate with me.  
**[0:46:20-0:46:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:46:20):**  You know, feel free to.  
**[0:46:22-0:46:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:46:22):**  Wow, see that all sounds really exciting.  
**[0:46:24-0:46:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:46:24):**  And I just want to say one more thing is that as much as we've talked about community dynamics  
**[0:46:29-0:46:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:46:29):**  and ecosystems here, the sculptures themselves are really stunning.  
**[0:46:33-0:46:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:46:33):**  You've done a fantastic job on those.  
**[0:46:35-0:46:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:46:35):**  And I really encourage people to take a look at these websites just to see how visually  
**[0:46:39-0:46:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:46:39):**  engaging these projects are as much as all of the other effects that they have that we've  
**[0:46:44-0:46:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:46:44):**  already talked about.  
**[0:46:45-0:46:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:46:45):**  So thank you very much.  
**[0:46:47-0:46:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:46:47):**  Fantastic work.  
**[0:46:48-0:46:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:46:48):**  I'm really looking forward to seeing the rest of these projects come to fruition.  
**[0:46:53-0:46:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:46:53):**  And I hope we can stay in touch.  
**[0:46:54-0:46:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/celia-gregory/#t=0:46:54):**  It's been great speaking with you.

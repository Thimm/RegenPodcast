**[0:14:00-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/will-harriss-of-white-oak-pastures-on-the-bigger-picture-of-a-regenerative-farm-business/#t=0:14:00):**  especially for such a large volume of products.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/will-harriss-of-white-oak-pastures-on-the-bigger-picture-of-a-regenerative-farm-business/#t=0:14:03):**  Some of the farmers that are with us today have large operations as well, many hundreds

**[0:14:19-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/will-harriss-of-white-oak-pastures-on-the-bigger-picture-of-a-regenerative-farm-business/#t=0:14:19):**  Yes.

**[0:14:27-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/will-harriss-of-white-oak-pastures-on-the-bigger-picture-of-a-regenerative-farm-business/#t=0:14:27):**  I mean there is no correct scale.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/will-harriss-of-white-oak-pastures-on-the-bigger-picture-of-a-regenerative-farm-business/#t=0:14:29):**  It's highly situational.

**[0:14:59-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/will-harriss-of-white-oak-pastures-on-the-bigger-picture-of-a-regenerative-farm-business/#t=0:14:59):**  We're a long way from the market.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/will-harriss-of-white-oak-pastures-on-the-bigger-picture-of-a-regenerative-farm-business/#t=0:15:01):**  I have no local market.

**[0:15:12-0:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/will-harriss-of-white-oak-pastures-on-the-bigger-picture-of-a-regenerative-farm-business/#t=0:15:12):**  If you have a very small plot of land in one of the zip codes that's got very high disposable

**[0:15:22-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/will-harriss-of-white-oak-pastures-on-the-bigger-picture-of-a-regenerative-farm-business/#t=0:15:22):**  There's every shade of gray in between those two.

**[0:15:31-0:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/will-harriss-of-white-oak-pastures-on-the-bigger-picture-of-a-regenerative-farm-business/#t=0:15:31):**  Anything from theater is highly situational.

**[0:15:47-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/will-harriss-of-white-oak-pastures-on-the-bigger-picture-of-a-regenerative-farm-business/#t=0:15:47):**  model, the industrial production model, I started changing it and liked the changes  
**[0:15:55-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/will-harriss-of-white-oak-pastures-on-the-bigger-picture-of-a-regenerative-farm-business/#t=0:15:55):**  that I saw.

**[0:16:02-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/will-harriss-of-white-oak-pastures-on-the-bigger-picture-of-a-regenerative-farm-business/#t=0:16:02):**  previously externalized.

**[0:16:13-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/will-harriss-of-white-oak-pastures-on-the-bigger-picture-of-a-regenerative-farm-business/#t=0:16:13):**  commodity market the way I had for the previous 20 years.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/will-harriss-of-white-oak-pastures-on-the-bigger-picture-of-a-regenerative-farm-business/#t=0:16:18):**  So I started marketing my product.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/will-harriss-of-white-oak-pastures-on-the-bigger-picture-of-a-regenerative-farm-business/#t=0:16:22):**  And in my case, the timing was very, very fortunate.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/will-harriss-of-white-oak-pastures-on-the-bigger-picture-of-a-regenerative-farm-business/#t=0:16:27):**  Not very smart, very fortunate.

**[0:16:40-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/will-harriss-of-white-oak-pastures-on-the-bigger-picture-of-a-regenerative-farm-business/#t=0:16:40):**  that they marketed as American grass fed beef.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/will-harriss-of-white-oak-pastures-on-the-bigger-picture-of-a-regenerative-farm-business/#t=0:16:43):**  That was pure, dumb luck timing.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/will-harriss-of-white-oak-pastures-on-the-bigger-picture-of-a-regenerative-farm-business/#t=0:16:46):**  But it worked, and their appetite was insatiable, and there was not many people doing it other  
**[0:16:55-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/will-harriss-of-white-oak-pastures-on-the-bigger-picture-of-a-regenerative-farm-business/#t=0:16:55):**  than me, a few, but not many.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/will-harriss-of-white-oak-pastures-on-the-bigger-picture-of-a-regenerative-farm-business/#t=0:16:59):**  So I built this company as a wholesale grass fed beef business at the inception.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/will-harriss-of-white-oak-pastures-on-the-bigger-picture-of-a-regenerative-farm-business/#t=0:17:11):**  Later I saw the need to add other species because of the animal impact primarily.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/will-harriss-of-white-oak-pastures-on-the-bigger-picture-of-a-regenerative-farm-business/#t=0:17:18):**  It also offered it allowed me to have more than one income stream, one product to sell

**[0:17:28-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/will-harriss-of-white-oak-pastures-on-the-bigger-picture-of-a-regenerative-farm-business/#t=0:17:28):**  But my primary motivation was the animal impact originally.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/will-harriss-of-white-oak-pastures-on-the-bigger-picture-of-a-regenerative-farm-business/#t=0:17:35):**  We did very well operating this as a wholesale business from I'd say about 2000 to about  
**[0:17:43-0:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/will-harriss-of-white-oak-pastures-on-the-bigger-picture-of-a-regenerative-farm-business/#t=0:17:43):**  2015 or so.

**[0:17:57-0:17:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/will-harriss-of-white-oak-pastures-on-the-bigger-picture-of-a-regenerative-farm-business/#t=0:17:57):**  market.

**[0:18:08-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/will-harriss-of-white-oak-pastures-on-the-bigger-picture-of-a-regenerative-farm-business/#t=0:18:08):**  I was able to keep a big portion of my business but not at a margin level that gave me the

**[0:18:35-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/will-harriss-of-white-oak-pastures-on-the-bigger-picture-of-a-regenerative-farm-business/#t=0:18:35):**  I also built a store refurbished, a 150 year old store and built a restaurant here on the

**[0:18:50-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/will-harriss-of-white-oak-pastures-on-the-bigger-picture-of-a-regenerative-farm-business/#t=0:18:50):**  My quote for salvation was the online business.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/will-harriss-of-white-oak-pastures-on-the-bigger-picture-of-a-regenerative-farm-business/#t=0:18:56):**  We had gotten that business, it grew very slowly and by 2020, we got it up to about

**[0:19:25-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/will-harriss-of-white-oak-pastures-on-the-bigger-picture-of-a-regenerative-farm-business/#t=0:19:25):**  I don't know what it would have been.

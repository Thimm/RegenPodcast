### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 08 Nov 2019 18:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:00:13):**  Here we dive deep into the diverse worlds of regenerative living, permaculture, and  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:00:17):**  natural building as we aspire to help you reach your highest potential for yourself,  
**[0:00:22-0:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:00:22):**  for your community, and for this beautiful planet that we share.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:00:25):**  As always, I'm your host Oliver Gaucher, and I'm thrilled to guide you through this  
**[0:00:29-0:00:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:00:29):**  week's episode, so let's jump right in!  
**[0:00:40-0:00:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:00:40):**  New Society Publishers' books are so green you could eat them!  
**[0:00:44-0:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:00:44):**  We print all our books in North America, never overseas, on 100% post-consumer recycled paper,  
**[0:00:50-0:00:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:00:50):**  we've been a carbon neutral company since 2006, our employees are shareholders, and  
**[0:00:56-0:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:00:56):**  we are a certified B Corporation.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:00:59):**  At New Society, we care deeply about what we publish, but also about how we do business.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:01:05):**  Find out more at newsociety.com.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:01:06):**  Now I was first introduced to Kristin Krash through Atulia Bingham, the well-known author  
**[0:01:13-0:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:01:13):**  and natural builder who's been on the show a few times now.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:01:16):**  She told me about the incredible little project in Ecuador focused on regenerating the native  
**[0:01:20-0:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:01:20):**  cloud forest and off-grid living, and that I had to speak with Kristin about her journey  
**[0:01:25-0:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:01:25):**  directly.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:01:26):**  So when I got to chat with Kristin, I was amazed at how well she knew her bioregion  
**[0:01:30-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:01:30):**  and the experience she could speak from about getting her dream project off the ground with  
**[0:01:35-0:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:01:35):**  her partner in the last few years.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:01:37):**  Three short years ago, Kristin and her partner Juan bought a degraded piece of land that  
**[0:01:42-0:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:01:42):**  she describes as a green desert, because though it was covered in non-native pasture grasses,  
**[0:01:47-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:01:47):**  the original tropical forest had been logged and was struggling to grow back.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:01:52):**  They called their project Sueno de Vida and set out with the goal of turning it into a  
**[0:01:57-0:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:01:57):**  nature reserve, permaculture farm, natural building project, and education center dedicated  
**[0:02:02-0:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:02:02):**  to forest restoration and sustainable living.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:02:05):**  In this interview, Kristin gives a remarkably well-informed explanation of how the industries  
**[0:02:10-0:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:02:10):**  in her area have left damaged ecosystems in their wake and the challenges of trying to  
**[0:02:14-0:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:02:14):**  restore them.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:02:16):**  She and I talk about the similarities and hilarious mishaps that we've both experienced  
**[0:02:21-0:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:02:21):**  with our respective projects and getting them off the ground with limited time and resources.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:02:26):**  She also walks me through the evolution and stages of their reforestation plan and some  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:02:30):**  of the experiments that they've done on the sites that they've observed around them  
**[0:02:35-0:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:02:35):**  to help them move forward.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:02:37):**  She also gives great advice for people who are interested in starting this kind of lifestyle  
**[0:02:41-0:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:02:41):**  and how to plan for an off-grid transition.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:02:44):**  Before we get started, if you want to know more about similar projects to this one, check  
**[0:02:48-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:02:48):**  out the previous two episodes from this series on reforestation and agroforestry.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:02:53):**  I've got great interviews from Jairo Rodriguez in southern Mexico and Alex Kronick, a good  
**[0:02:58-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:02:58):**  friend of mine from Guatemala who are both working to regenerate the tropical forests  
**[0:03:02-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:03:02):**  in their area through different techniques and resources.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:03:06):**  The three of these interviews are meant to be something of a trilogy of relatively small  
**[0:03:09-0:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:03:09):**  sized private land projects dedicated to a mixture of native forest regeneration as well  
**[0:03:15-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:03:15):**  as ecotourism and minor farming for economic viability in the tropics.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:03:20):**  All three have a lot in common but with different approaches to reach their goals.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:03:24):**  You can find links to all these episodes on the website at abundantedge.com.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:03:28):**  So with that said, I'll hand things over now to Kristin.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:03:32):**  We can just kind of start off with some background.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:03:37):**  So like Kristin, I know that you've been, how long have you been now in Ecuador?  
**[0:03:43-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:03:43):**  We've been here for four years now and we moved on to our land three years ago.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:03:48):**  Okay, so you've been there three years full time and you started it like four years ago,  
**[0:03:54-0:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:03:54):**  not full time.  
**[0:03:55-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:03:55):**  You weren't there at all.  
**[0:03:56-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:03:56):**  Yeah, we were in Quito.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:03:58):**  We came down, we didn't have any land, we came down, we were living in Quito with my  
**[0:04:03-0:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:04:03):**  partner's family, with Juan's family which was like really interesting for me because  
**[0:04:08-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:04:08):**  I haven't lived with a family for like over 20 years.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:04:12):**  So now I've been with this family.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:04:14):**  Oh yeah.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:04:15):**  Yeah, that was intense.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:04:20):**  So we were in Quito for about eight or nine months and as soon as we got a little rundown  
**[0:04:26-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:04:26):**  SUV, we got this Russian Jeep, a Niva Lada.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:04:28):**  I don't know if you've ever heard of these but they're these Russian Jeeps from like  
**[0:04:33-0:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:04:33):**  the 1970s.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:04:34):**  But they can go anywhere.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:04:36):**  They're like tractors and so we got one of those and we started driving around kind of  
**[0:04:41-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:04:41):**  like remote areas looking for a place to pitch camp.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:04:45):**  And we in July of 2016, we dug out our first foundations, the first trenches went in the  
**[0:04:57-0:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:04:57):**  ground.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:04:58):**  And it's pretty surreal to look back at the pictures because it's just like a flattened  
**[0:05:03-0:05:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:05:03):**  out area with four circles dug in the ground, spray painted circles and started digging.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:05:12):**  And they kind of looked like we're calling the aliens or something.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:05:15):**  It's just these like four circles in the ground.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:05:17):**  Like crop circles or something.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:05:18):**  And so yeah, that was the beginning.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:05:21):**  And that was July 2016.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:05:24):**  So it's been almost exactly three years.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:05:27):**  That's awesome.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:05:28):**  So wait, okay.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:05:29):**  So here, let's start from the beginning.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:05:31):**  Yeah, that was it.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:05:32):**  That was all we had.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:05:33):**  People were so funny because they'd see these pictures.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:05:36):**  So let's start from the beginning.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:05:37):**  And if you could start by giving me an idea, like how did the idea for this project form  
**[0:05:42-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:05:42):**  and what were your primary motivations in going out to Ecuador in the first place?  
**[0:05:46-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:05:46):**  Yeah.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:05:47):**  So like I said, our motivations at first were a little more cloudy because I had been a  
**[0:05:54-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:05:54):**  yoga teacher for 16 years in DC and I had done a lot of sort of like urban permaculture,  
**[0:06:02-0:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:06:02):**  gorilla gardening, growing food wherever I lived, up trellises and in containers and  
**[0:06:08-0:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:06:08):**  in alleys.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:06:09):**  But I didn't have any large scale land regeneration experience.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:06:13):**  And I'll tell you what, honestly, I mean, I swear to God, this is the absolute truth.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:06:18):**  We watched a lot of TV.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:06:20):**  We watched Alaskan Bush People.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:06:22):**  We watched The Last Frontier.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:06:24):**  We watched all these shows where people go off the grid and they sort of have these really  
**[0:06:30-0:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:06:30):**  hard, vigorous, but free lives.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:06:32):**  And we're like, yeah, we're going to do that.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:06:35):**  I mean, it was pretty, it was that far out.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:06:40):**  At first I was sort of clinging a little bit to this idea of staying closer to a tourist  
**[0:06:46-0:06:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:06:46):**  area.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:06:47):**  And that just kind of went by the wayside when we found the land because we realized  
**[0:06:53-0:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:06:53):**  that now that we're in this sort of like a little bit more of a remote area and we saw  
**[0:06:59-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:06:59):**  the impact of what deforestation has done to the cloud forest door.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:07:06):**  I mean, it's right there.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:07:09):**  It became much more strong for us, much more of a strong calling for us to do something  
**[0:07:14-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:07:14):**  about that, to do something about more regenerative for the land.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:07:18):**  And also just out of necessity because we were having a really hard, for the first time  
**[0:07:23-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:07:23):**  in my life, I was having a hard time growing food.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:07:26):**  I mean, you can't just throw seeds in the ground and expect the Garden of Eden to sprout  
**[0:07:33-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:07:33):**  up when you're dealing with a compacted, degraded pasture of what's left after the land has  
**[0:07:41-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:07:41):**  been deforested.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:07:42):**  So it was like the regeneration was just as much out of necessity so that we could live  
**[0:07:47-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:07:47):**  here as it was as an ideal, as sort of this more idealistic thing to do.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:07:54):**  So I was like, no, we have to improve the soil.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:07:56):**  We have to make this better because you can't grow anything here.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:08:02):**  The land is really degraded.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:08:03):**  It's in bad shape.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:08:06):**  So yeah, we kind of went from watching reality TV survival shows to becoming land regenerators  
**[0:08:14-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:08:14):**  and large scale permaculturists in the course of about a year actually.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:08:22):**  But really that's how we got started.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:08:25):**  So I like to get that out there because I think a lot of people think you really need  
**[0:08:29-0:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:08:29):**  to, you know, really you have to do your PDC course and you have to know all these things  
**[0:08:36-0:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:08:36):**  before you start.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:08:37):**  And I think really like just getting in there and living on your land and camping on your  
**[0:08:43-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:08:43):**  land and being in it, you know, observing it, seeing where the water goes when the rainy  
**[0:08:49-0:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:08:49):**  season starts, how to start moving, how to start channeling in drainage or making swales  
**[0:08:55-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:08:55):**  or these things or whatever it is that you're going to do.  
**[0:08:58-0:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:08:58):**  You have to be there.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:08:59):**  You have to be there.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:09:00):**  You can sit at home and draw pictures in your notebooks all day long, you know, but when  
**[0:09:05-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:09:05):**  you're there, everything changes.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:09:08):**  So we jumped in with both feet and we broke all the rules.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:09:12):**  We didn't start small.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:09:14):**  We started with four large structures and we made a lot of mistakes and we learned a  
**[0:09:18-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:09:18):**  lot along the way, but fortunately because we're both really hard working and tenacious,  
**[0:09:24-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:09:24):**  it worked out.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:09:25):**  Well, so tell me a little bit about this learning curve.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:09:30):**  You know, you said you weren't coming down there with a ton of education and experience  
**[0:09:33-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:09:33):**  of how to do especially larger scale projects.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:09:37):**  How did you start to experiment and try things out to see what would work in your context?  
**[0:09:43-0:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:09:43):**  Well, at first I was, you know, everything seems really great because we had leveled  
**[0:09:51-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:09:51):**  out a very small area of not leveled, but flattened out a little bit and had it cleared  
**[0:09:56-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:09:56):**  by a tractor, a 500 square meter area.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:10:00):**  And so the soil had all been turned over and you know, the grass was underneath and I just,  
**[0:10:05-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:10:05):**  I started there and I stuck a couple tropical sweet potatoes in the ground, some kamote  
**[0:10:11-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:10:11):**  in the ground and they did great.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:10:13):**  They just ran rampant and I had a great sweet potato crop and I had a great squash crop.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:10:20):**  But I learned the hard way about adapting to your climate and not trying to grow temperate  
**[0:10:28-0:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:10:28):**  climate zone things in a subtropical forest.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:10:32):**  Like I planted all, you know, like salad stuff, like ridiculous things, radishes and sprouts  
**[0:10:41-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:10:41):**  and you know, greens and all these things and they just, everything just died.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:10:46):**  It either wilted in the ground or the insects just came and devoured it or a hard rain came  
**[0:10:52-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:10:52):**  and just knocked everything out.  
**[0:10:55-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:10:55):**  So then I figured out, you know, if I'm going to live here and I'm going to grow food, I  
**[0:11:01-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:11:01):**  have to really look around and see what people are eating and see what people are growing.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:11:06):**  This is how I discovered the plantain and the cassava and the big, tough tropical foods  
**[0:11:13-0:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:11:13):**  that you know, are hard and scaly on the outside and soft and delicious on the inside.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:11:19):**  And I had to learn how to adapt to my climate and adapt to the insects and the rain and  
**[0:11:26-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:11:26):**  these really harsh climatic conditions that, you know, when you come from North America,  
**[0:11:32-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:11:32):**  like they don't really seem harsh.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:11:33):**  You're like, well, wait, it's 75 degrees every day.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:11:37):**  It's so nice here, you know, until it starts raining and it's hours and hours and hours  
**[0:11:44-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:11:44):**  of rain that like every drop can fill a teacup and it's just battering you down.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:11:50):**  I mean then you realize like, no, this is not a, this isn't just like a ready-made garden  
**[0:11:57-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:11:57):**  of Eden.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:11:58):**  This is going to take some adaptation and it's going to take some work and it's what  
**[0:12:03-0:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:12:03):**  it did was it also opened our eyes and even my partner Juan who's Ecuadorian, who had  
**[0:12:10-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:12:10):**  never lived in a subtropical cloud forest either.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:12:13):**  He's from the Quito area.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:12:16):**  You know, when we came down, we saw this, what we now know are artificially planted  
**[0:12:23-0:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:12:23):**  pastures, sown grass seed and you know, just the quick background of what happens is once  
**[0:12:29-0:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:12:29):**  the land is deforested, the logging companies, they sell off the lands usually very cheaply  
**[0:12:36-0:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:12:36):**  once they've taken out all the trees and the useful materials to the people that work for  
**[0:12:40-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:12:40):**  them.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:12:41):**  Actually the guy that we bought our land from was a, he's an Ecuadorian lumberjack.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:12:45):**  He was in there cutting down the trees and then they sell off the land to the workers  
**[0:12:51-0:12:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:12:51):**  and people that don't have the money to do any sort of intensive agriculture on that  
**[0:12:59-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:12:59):**  land, they just sow grass seed and it's GMO cloned European grass seed.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:13:06):**  It's rye grass.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:13:07):**  It's things that are just, they're not at all native to the tropics and then they move  
**[0:13:11-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:13:11):**  the cows in and then it's, you know, there's no one to blame here.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:13:14):**  I mean it's not like, you know, I'm certainly not going to blame subsistence level dairy  
**[0:13:18-0:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:13:18):**  farmers for deforestation.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:13:21):**  I mean they're picking up the remains of what's left after the extraction, you know, so this  
**[0:13:28-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:13:28):**  is certainly not the fault of the poor guy that we bought the land from, you know, but  
**[0:13:33-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:13:33):**  this is the condition that it's left in.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:13:36):**  And it really made me appreciate that I have a really a North American or European eye  
**[0:13:43-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:13:43):**  for land because we had seen some other properties and to us like it was jungle.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:13:49):**  It was just like this is jungle.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:13:50):**  This is like you can't live here.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:13:53):**  There's no open space.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:13:56):**  And that was our perception coming from North America was that somehow land that's been  
**[0:14:01-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:14:01):**  cleared up a little bit is better and that's a total misperception.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:14:06):**  I just want to anybody out there who's going to listen to this that is looking for land  
**[0:14:10-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:14:10):**  in tropical or subtropical areas, if somebody wants to sell you a forest, buy the forest.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:14:17):**  Oh yeah.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:14:19):**  There's this perception everywhere that I've been where when people are getting ready to  
**[0:14:25-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:14:25):**  sell their plot, they'll take out all the vegetation, they'll leave it bare.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:14:29):**  I don't know where this comes from, but it's rampant everywhere.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:14:34):**  It's rampant.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:14:35):**  It's like somehow it's like where it's like when you before you sell your house, you know,  
**[0:14:39-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:14:39):**  you clean it, right?  
**[0:14:40-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:14:40):**  It's like, no, I have to clean my land.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:14:42):**  You know what I mean?  
**[0:14:43-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:14:43):**  That's what they call it in Guatemala.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:14:46):**  You do the limpiesa.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:14:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:14:48):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:14:49):**  The limpiesa, you clean the land.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:14:50):**  They call it the same thing here.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:14:51):**  And you know, and I, and, and, and we were talking to some friends of ours who are, have  
**[0:14:55-0:15:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:14:55):**  a mature agroforestry project where they grow cacao.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:15:00):**  And I'll never forget what my friend who's now my friend, Augustina said, no, it's, it's  
**[0:15:05-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:15:05):**  mas facil cuando es bosque.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:15:09):**  It's easier when you can start with a forest.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:15:12):**  And you know, we don't know this coming from North America or Europe, but subtropical forest,  
**[0:15:17-0:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:15:17):**  a lot of it is you get in there with a machete and you can, you can hack down a lot in a  
**[0:15:22-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:15:22):**  day.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:15:23):**  And a lot of it is just like this sort of rampant, viney, spindly growth that it's,  
**[0:15:29-0:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:15:29):**  it's, it's very easy to cut.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:15:31):**  But then you can clear up like small, little small spaces as you go.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:15:36):**  The canopy is intact.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:15:38):**  Canopy is so important because you don't have the rain battering the ground and leaching  
**[0:15:43-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:15:43):**  out all the nutrients and just washing it away in a mud.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:15:47):**  And as you're, you know, cutting some of this vegetation, little by little, you have your  
**[0:15:52-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:15:52):**  green manure, you have your, you know, your, your, your, your bio compost is right there.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:15:59):**  But I didn't, we didn't know this.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:16:00):**  And we just bought this grassy land because we had no idea.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:16:05):**  We thought it was a meadow.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:16:07):**  There's no meadows.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:16:09):**  Yeah, that doesn't happen.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:16:13):**  But that is how clueless we were, you know, four years ago.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:16:18):**  It was just like, Oh no, this is cleared up.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:16:20):**  This will be so much easier.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:16:22):**  We just have to, you just have to plant things, you know, and not knowing about now I've,  
**[0:16:29-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:16:29):**  I've really gone into the education of it.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:16:33):**  I'm so fascinated by the process of ecological regeneration and, and historically, I mean,  
**[0:16:42-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:16:42):**  historically it's so fascinating to find out that how botanists are, are figuring out through  
**[0:16:48-0:16:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:16:48):**  carbon dating, they're finding seeds that have been in cultivation for over 5,000 years.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:16:53):**  I mean, now the oldest cow, you know, the chocolate plant is we know is in, is, was  
**[0:16:59-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:16:59):**  found in Ecuador, 5,300 years old.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:17:04):**  And that, you know, Manioc cassava has been in cultivation for 8,000 years.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:17:09):**  Yeah, there's there are 138 crops have now been identified in the Amazon basin of Ecuador,  
**[0:17:20-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:17:20):**  Peru and Columbia.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:17:22):**  Because these are all cultivated crops that are older than 4,000 years, more than half  
**[0:17:28-0:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:17:28):**  of them are tree crops.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:17:30):**  So what that, what this is, is what now the historians, the archeologists and the botanists  
**[0:17:36-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:17:36):**  are revising the history to say is that the, that these subtropical and tropical forests  
**[0:17:44-0:17:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:17:44):**  are not this untouched virgin lands that people thought that they were.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:17:50):**  They were actually managed food forests.  
**[0:17:56-0:18:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:17:56):**  It's no accident that there's 138 edible species.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:18:00):**  I mean, that doesn't, that doesn't happen by accident.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:18:03):**  If you're walking through a wild forest, you might find a couple things you can eat, but  
**[0:18:08-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:18:08):**  you're not going to find 138 things that you can eat.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:18:12):**  And to me, that's just fascinating is what we can now learn from the people who manage  
**[0:18:18-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:18:18):**  this land previously, you know, like coming in here with our permaculture and our agroforestry,  
**[0:18:25-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:18:25):**  like you know, like these are new things.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:18:28):**  And they're so not, you know, I mean, what it is, is we're actually learning from these  
**[0:18:34-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:18:34):**  people in the past who unfortunately, and then people will, the next obvious question  
**[0:18:38-0:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:18:38):**  is, well, what happened to them?  
**[0:18:40-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:18:40):**  Well, 90% of them were wiped out by European diseases before they even ever saw a white  
**[0:18:45-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:18:45):**  person.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:18:47):**  So the lands that the later explorers after the conquistadors encountered this virgin  
**[0:18:53-0:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:18:53):**  wilderness that they wrote about, if they would have been, if they would have seen it  
**[0:18:58-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:18:58):**  a hundred years before that, they would have seen cities, cities in the Amazon with thriving  
**[0:19:06-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:19:06):**  agroforestry systems behind them.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:19:09):**  You know, so that's, that's to me is like super interesting that what we're doing is  
**[0:19:13-0:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:19:13):**  we're actually recreating.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:19:15):**  We're not creating anything.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:19:17):**  We're recreating how to manage, how to intelligently manage forest lands so that people and animals  
**[0:19:27-0:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:19:27):**  and plants can all live there.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:19:29):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:19:30):**  Well, so let's talk specifically about the environment that you're in then, the cloud  
**[0:19:34-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:19:34):**  forest and a little bit about what's unique to that ecosystem and why it's at risk these  
**[0:19:41-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:19:41):**  days.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:19:42):**  What's, what's threatening it?  
**[0:19:44-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:19:44):**  Well, the cloud forest is very similar to rainforest except it's at a higher altitude.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:19:50):**  That's really the only difference between cloud forest and rainforest is cloud forest  
**[0:19:53-0:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:19:53):**  is usually in the foothills of the mountain system.  
**[0:19:55-0:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:19:55):**  We're in the foothills of the Andes, whereas rainforest is usually in a, in a basin, right?  
**[0:20:00-0:20:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:20:00):**  Like the Amazon is the classic example.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:20:03):**  So we're at a, we're at about 2000 feet, 650 meters.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:20:10):**  And so the, the main difference in the cloud forest is like the biodiversity is, it's not  
**[0:20:16-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:20:16):**  quite as obvious as it is, is in a rainforest, but there's actually a greater degree of it.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:20:22):**  Per square meter of rainforest is the, I'm sorry, of cloud forest is the most biodiverse  
**[0:20:29-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:20:29):**  biosphere on the planet.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:20:33):**  With this constant presence of moisture in the air that allows there to be this web,  
**[0:20:41-0:20:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:20:41):**  this like incredible, intricate web of life where every tree you look at has 9 million  
**[0:20:49-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:20:49):**  epiphytes growing on it.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:20:50):**  And I'm not even exaggerating.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:20:51):**  I mean, it could be 9 million epiphytes growing on it.  
**[0:20:54-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:20:54):**  And every one of those epiphytes, the orchidias, the bromeliads is also a web of life inside.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:21:01):**  If you look inside, there's insects and there's larvae and there's eggs and there's all sorts  
**[0:21:05-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:21:05):**  of microorganisms.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:21:07):**  So the cloud forest is super important for its, its degree of biodiversity.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:21:13):**  You know, it's this, this very, very delicate web of life that lives here.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:21:18):**  And just like the life in the rainforest, the fertility of it is, is it's not an illusion,  
**[0:21:26-0:21:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:21:26):**  but it's the problem, the biggest problem with deforestation is that the fertility is  
**[0:21:32-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:21:32):**  really on the razor's edge.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:21:34):**  The fertility doesn't exist in the soil like it does in prairie soils or, you know, savanna  
**[0:21:41-0:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:21:41):**  soils where the top soil is deep.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:21:43):**  The top soil here is super shallow.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:21:47):**  Sometimes it's just like an inch or two.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:21:49):**  And what's holding all the life in the soil is the lateral root system of the ground cover  
**[0:21:55-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:21:55):**  and all of the trees don't go down as much here in cloud forest as they do in a, in a  
**[0:22:01-0:22:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:22:01):**  temperate zone.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:22:02):**  They, the tree, the roots branch out.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:22:04):**  So you have these incredible lateral root systems that just spread out all over the  
**[0:22:09-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:22:09):**  ground and they're literally holding the earth in place.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:22:12):**  And when those trees come out, there's not only is the rain hitting the ground with more  
**[0:22:17-0:22:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:22:17):**  forest cause you've taken out the canopy, but you've taken out the root system that's  
**[0:22:21-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:22:21):**  holding everything there.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:22:23):**  So the whole web is disrupted.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:22:26):**  The whole web can be ripped out by taking out these trees.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:22:32):**  Most of our area was deforested not for lumber, but for rubber.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:22:38):**  Rubber was the main extraction crop back, I think it was back in the fifties and the  
**[0:22:44-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:22:44):**  post-war world boom, you know, when everybody's economy was booming after World War II and  
**[0:22:49-0:22:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:22:49):**  there were so many more new cars and everybody needed tires for their cars.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:22:54):**  So a lot of, a lot of the cloud forest here was cut down for the rubber.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:22:59):**  Now what's happening is whatever is left, a lot of the rubber trees and the big trees  
**[0:23:06-0:23:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:23:06):**  were taken out in the fifties and sixties.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:23:09):**  And since then it's whatever's left has been a lot of wood pulp that is used for clothing  
**[0:23:15-0:23:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:23:15):**  actually.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:23:17):**  So this is why I tell people like don't buy, like if you want to do something to save the  
**[0:23:21-0:23:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:23:21):**  forest, don't buy new clothes.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:23:23):**  Stop buying new clothes, especially all this cheap crap like Forever 21 stuff.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:23:28):**  Like most of these clothes are made from some sort of a polyester with a wood pulp and this  
**[0:23:33-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:23:33):**  wood pulp is being extracted from the cloud forest.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:23:37):**  So you know, buying new clothes is like if you want to help save the forest, don't buy  
**[0:23:42-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:23:42):**  new clothes, especially bad cheap clothes that when you wash them, you know, they change  
**[0:23:46-0:23:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:23:46):**  shape and you can never wear them again.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:23:49):**  So that's, yeah.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:23:52):**  So then, and now also one of the factors that's affecting us is oil palm.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:23:58):**  Is there's a lot of investment coming into the cloud forest, an area from India and from  
**[0:24:03-0:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:24:03):**  China buying up big swaths of land and converting it over to oil palm production, not for palm  
**[0:24:10-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:24:10):**  oil for eating, but for biofuel.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:24:13):**  Yeah, so that's another thing that's affecting us.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:24:17):**  So a lot of people think like, oh, biofuel.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:24:19):**  I'm like, great, it's green.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:24:21):**  I'm like, well, not, not really.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:24:24):**  I mean, it's a little bit more complex than that.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:24:28):**  A hectare of oil palms.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:24:31):**  I think you can support about 800 oil palms on one hectare and if that hectare was left  
**[0:24:37-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:24:37):**  to native forest, it could support about more like 2,600, a variety of 2,600 trees.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:24:45):**  So oil palm is a little bit more destructive.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:24:50):**  Yeah, hey, I'm working.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:24:53):**  My friends just came in.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:24:56):**  Anyway, so those are some of the factors that are affecting us and what people can do if  
**[0:25:03-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:25:03):**  they're not actively reforesting a cloud forest like we're here trying to do is they can not  
**[0:25:09-0:25:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:25:09):**  buy new clothes and not support biofuels without knowing what you're talking about.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:25:17):**  Always know what you're talking about before you jump on a bandwagon for anything.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:25:20):**  Sure.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:25:21):**  And certainly in other areas too, like you mentioned the cattle industry having a big  
**[0:25:25-0:25:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:25:25):**  impact in those previously disforested areas.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:25:28):**  Right.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:25:29):**  Yeah, I mean, our situation is different from Brazil.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:25:33):**  I mean, in Brazil, land is specifically cleared out for the cattle industry and it's cattle,  
**[0:25:43-0:25:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:25:43):**  Brazil is a big exporter of beef.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:25:46):**  Ecuador is not really a big exporter of beef, neither is Peru or Colombia.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:25:51):**  What happens is that the trees are extracted for other reasons and then once the land is  
**[0:25:57-0:26:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:25:57):**  cleared, like I said, it's sold off to lumberjacks and working class people who then the cheapest  
**[0:26:04-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:26:04):**  thing for them to do is to sow grass seed and bring the cows in.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:26:09):**  So it's a little bit more of an indirect process, but the end result is the same.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:26:13):**  Sure.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:26:14):**  So it's not clear for the intention of grazing, but grazing is what keeps the forest from  
**[0:26:20-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:26:20):**  growing back as well.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:26:21):**  Grazing is what keeps the forest from growing back.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:26:24):**  And actually one of the things that motivated me to really start learning about this is  
**[0:26:33-0:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:26:33):**  our mutual friend Atulia Carrie Bingham, she wrote a really intelligent piece, as all her  
**[0:26:39-0:26:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:26:39):**  pieces are very intelligent and well-written, on letting your land rewild itself.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:26:46):**  And I think that that's really a good, it's a great idea and it's a very powerful idea  
**[0:26:55-0:27:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:26:55):**  because there is this, obviously this perception that we talked about cleaning everything.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:27:00):**  Oh my, I have to go clean my land.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:27:03):**  I'm scrubbing it like a car or something.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:27:06):**  And letting things go a little bit so that animals can live there.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:27:09):**  And I think rewilding is a great concept where it can happen.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:27:14):**  But I think it's also really important to realize that there are places in the world  
**[0:27:20-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:27:20):**  that are not going to rewild themselves.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:27:24):**  I mean, we have three hectares that we originally bought.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:27:29):**  We now have 15 hectares under our management because we've sold land to some interested  
**[0:27:35-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:27:35):**  parties.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:27:36):**  But we have a whole, I'd say like a hectare of land on the other side of our spring, our  
**[0:27:42-0:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:27:42):**  starrow that we haven't touched in three years.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:27:47):**  And it is a sea of grass all over.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:27:50):**  It is a freaking green desert.  
**[0:27:52-0:28:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:27:52):**  I mean, it is nothing is going to grow there unless we actively go over there and plant  
**[0:28:00-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:28:00):**  some trees.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:28:01):**  I mean, it is just sad.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:28:05):**  I mean, it's like, and the thing is, okay, you know, if the land is left alone, if the  
**[0:28:10-0:28:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:28:10):**  land is left alone for 100 years, eventually some pioneers will spring up like these tough  
**[0:28:17-0:28:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:28:17):**  scrubby bushes that could grow anywhere.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:28:20):**  Some of them will eventually start to spring up.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:28:22):**  Nine or 10 years later, they'll die and fall over.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:28:26):**  They'll leave a little bit of a clearing.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:28:28):**  Maybe a bird will fly over and poop out some seeds and maybe the seeds will hit that little  
**[0:28:33-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:28:33):**  clear spot and maybe some of those seeds will germinate and maybe some of those seeds will  
**[0:28:39-0:28:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:28:39):**  grow into mature trees.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:28:41):**  But that's a lot of maybes and that's a very long time.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:28:44):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:28:45):**  The successional model is severely stunted in that area, right?  
**[0:28:50-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:28:50):**  You know, and so what I want to emphasize is that, you know, rewilding land is, it's  
**[0:28:57-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:28:57):**  not like you're running around at a music festival with flowers in your hair.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:29:02):**  Like rewilding, like it doesn't, because humans have been so greedy, it's not going to happen  
**[0:29:09-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:29:09):**  that way.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:29:10):**  Like I'm sort of a little bit more proactive.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:29:12):**  It's like, look, we made this mess and if I step in and I'm not claiming to be, you  
**[0:29:20-0:29:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:29:20):**  know, mother nature with the wisdom of mother nature, but I can see what's going on here.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:29:26):**  And if I help, if I can jumpstart this process and I can, you know, plant some baby trees  
**[0:29:33-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:29:33):**  and clean around them and give them a jumpstart in 15, I mean, things grow fast down here  
**[0:29:38-0:29:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:29:38):**  in 15 years I can reforest this pasture.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:29:44):**  It will take nature 150 years to do the same thing.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:29:48):**  And you know what, in the meantime, like I will die and someone else can buy this land  
**[0:29:54-0:30:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:29:54):**  who doesn't have my ideas and let it go back to being a pasture or put in some agro industrial  
**[0:30:01-0:30:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:30:01):**  oil palm farm or something else.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:30:05):**  So I think that where we have the means to do it and the will to do it and the strength  
**[0:30:10-0:30:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:30:10):**  to do it, I think we need to do it while we can.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:30:13):**  I 100% agree.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:30:15):**  So within that line, let's talk about your vision for the finished or maybe the ideal  
**[0:30:21-0:30:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:30:21):**  state of your project and how that sort of morphed since you've gotten there and what  
**[0:30:26-0:30:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:30:26):**  you see as its potential now that you understand the context much better.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:30:32):**  Well, it's definitely morphed because we realized that, of course, you know, there's something  
**[0:30:43-0:30:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:30:43):**  like we talked about this a little bit before that there's a little bit of a dichotomy,  
**[0:30:47-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:30:47):**  there's a split in how people see conservation versus like, you know, agriculture, right?  
**[0:30:55-0:30:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:30:55):**  There's conservation and there's agriculture, you're either on one side or the other.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:30:59):**  And if you want to be productive and you want to make a profit off your land, you go the  
**[0:31:03-0:31:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:31:03):**  way of agriculture, which usually involves, you know, herbicides and clearing and fertilizers  
**[0:31:10-0:31:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:31:10):**  and just all this stuff that comes from the green revolution.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:31:13):**  And if you're doing conservation, you know, your avenues for making money might be more  
**[0:31:19-0:31:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:31:19):**  like in birdwatching and trail walks and things like that, but you're not going to make money  
**[0:31:24-0:31:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:31:24):**  off the land.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:31:25):**  You're doing conservation, you're doing agriculture.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:31:29):**  And what we've come to realize is that from, especially now that I'm all jazzed up about  
**[0:31:34-0:31:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:31:34):**  the history of the Amazon basin being a managed forest, that in reality, if humans are going  
**[0:31:42-0:31:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:31:42):**  to survive on this planet, we need to learn how to do both.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:31:46):**  And this dichotomy, we have to stop thinking in terms of this dichotomy.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:31:51):**  We have to start thinking in terms of how to manage land productively, but also in a  
**[0:31:57-0:32:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:31:57):**  way that allows it to be in conservation.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:32:03):**  So what am I talking about here in real terms?  
**[0:32:05-0:32:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:32:05):**  So I'm talking about, okay, so say we have 15 hectares, right?  
**[0:32:09-0:32:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:32:09):**  I would say a good two thirds of that we can lead to either natural regeneration or what  
**[0:32:18-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:32:18):**  we're doing is we're working with a reforestation foundation to plant native trees that need  
**[0:32:25-0:32:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:32:25):**  less care.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:32:26):**  They're not cultivars.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:32:27):**  Some of them produce edible fruits or berries.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:32:29):**  Some of them don't.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:32:30):**  Some of them produce like soap berries and things like that.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:32:33):**  But we're not really interested in growing those for production.  
**[0:32:37-0:32:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:32:37):**  These are just like tough, strong native trees that will take hold.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:32:41):**  They will provide shade, they'll provide biomass, and they can help to take over areas that  
**[0:32:47-0:32:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:32:47):**  we can't be in actively managing all the time.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:32:51):**  In the areas that we want to put under more, that we're putting under more intense cultivation,  
**[0:32:56-0:33:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:32:56):**  we're planting polycultures of highly productive crops that also have a high sales value.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:33:05):**  Mostly cacao, heirloom variety of cacao called the Romana Sinal that Ecuador is famous for,  
**[0:33:11-0:33:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:33:11):**  there's also a lot of nuts, ginger, turmeric, cardamom, cinnamon, nutmeg.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:33:21):**  If you go in your grocery store and you look on the spice shelf, you're going to notice  
**[0:33:24-0:33:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:33:24):**  that these are all very high sales things that even have good high price points selling  
**[0:33:30-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:33:30):**  as agricultural products.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:33:33):**  Black pepper, vanilla, the list goes on.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:33:36):**  But these are all good expensive high points of sale price things.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:33:42):**  And then also food, things that we eat, cassava, banana, plantain, kamote, Malabar spinach,  
**[0:33:50-0:33:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:33:50):**  different varieties of tropical herbs that I've learned how to grow.  
**[0:33:53-0:34:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:33:53):**  So that's how we see it as sort of a being like a two-thirds conservation, but a conservation  
**[0:34:01-0:34:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:34:01):**  that we're actively jump-starting and a third of intense cultivation of things that we can  
**[0:34:08-0:34:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:34:08):**  sell and eat.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:34:11):**  And I think that will work.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:34:17):**  I think that that will prove to be viable.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:34:21):**  We have some good colleagues in the area doing similar projects and they're making a decent  
**[0:34:28-0:34:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:34:28):**  living cultivating high points of sale crops like cacao and cardamom, nutmeg, ginger, things  
**[0:34:36-0:34:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:34:36):**  like that.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:34:37):**  And they also have quite a bit of their land under conservation, but conservation that  
**[0:34:42-0:34:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:34:42):**  they have an eye on.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:34:45):**  They're not just letting the pasture go crazy, but conservation that they're helping a lot.  
**[0:34:52-0:35:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:34:52):**  And that's really our vision is a managed property that combines the wildness of conservation  
**[0:35:02-0:35:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:35:02):**  for the bringing back a lot of wildlife.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:35:05):**  And we were seeing a crazy wildlife rejuvenation on our lands.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:35:10):**  We see so many birds, species, and butterflies, and insects, and frogs, and lizards, and snakes  
**[0:35:17-0:35:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:35:17):**  that we didn't see when we moved here.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:35:21):**  So we know that we're doing something good.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:35:23):**  We've only been here three years, but we know we're doing something good.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:35:27):**  The amount of wildlife we've seen has, I'd say, quadruples with no exaggeration.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:35:32):**  No, I mean, to me that's probably the best feedback that you're doing something positive  
**[0:35:37-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:35:37):**  is when a whole bunch of life starts to come about your efforts that are non-direct sort  
**[0:35:45-0:35:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:35:45):**  of, yeah, cultivations by your own hand.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:35:48):**  It starts to compound larger than sort of the sum of its parts.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:35:52):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:35:53-0:36:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:35:53):**  I mean, and it really reduces, you know, you're reducing your need for inputs.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:36:02):**  You know, one of the ways, I think, you know, our vision has, it's grown from our experience.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:36:11):**  That's really the best way to put it.  
**[0:36:14-0:36:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:36:14):**  It's not just this idea of reading agroforestry books and reading permaculture books.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:36:19):**  I'm kind of like one of those people, like I read the book after I start.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:36:23):**  You know what I mean?  
**[0:36:24-0:36:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:36:24):**  I'm like, oh yeah, this is what I'm doing, you know?  
**[0:36:28-0:36:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:36:28):**  And I get like the validation and the feedback, but I'm like, oh yeah, I've been doing this.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:36:34):**  And you know, for example, like when you're first out there in the pasture, if you read  
**[0:36:39-0:36:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:36:39):**  the agroforestry and the permaculture books, you know, add a lot of biomass to your soil.  
**[0:36:44-0:36:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:36:44):**  Cut down, you know, but there's nothing to cut when you're in a pasture.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:36:47):**  Like you're just cutting grass.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:36:49):**  You know, there's just like, you're like, where am I going to get all this great foliage  
**[0:36:53-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:36:53):**  to put on the ground?  
**[0:36:54-0:36:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:36:54):**  Like where's my green fertilizer?  
**[0:36:56-0:36:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:36:56):**  You know?  
**[0:36:57-0:36:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:36:57):**  And that takes time.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:36:59):**  Luckily in a sub-tropical tropical area, even in the Eastern seaboard of the United States,  
**[0:37:04-0:37:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:37:04):**  I mean, you have hope weeds that grow four feet in one summer.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:37:08):**  I mean, there's always going to be some big scrubby weeds that are going to grow really  
**[0:37:12-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:37:12):**  fast that you can start using as green fertilizers, you know, pretty soon.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:37:19):**  And you put those on the ground around your new trees and you don't realize it, but what  
**[0:37:25-0:37:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:37:25):**  you're doing is you're calling forth all the life that's been underground, kind of like  
**[0:37:32-0:37:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:37:32):**  just waiting for something to eat, to come up and start digesting this stuff that you've  
**[0:37:39-0:37:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:37:39):**  put on the ground.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:37:40):**  To you it's mulch, right?  
**[0:37:42-0:37:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:37:42):**  But this whole like web of insect life and microorganism life in the ground, that's food.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:37:49):**  And the beetles come up and they start gnawing on it and the worms come up and then the ants  
**[0:37:54-0:37:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:37:54):**  start eating the worms.  
**[0:37:56-0:38:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:37:56):**  And you start getting this whole chain reaction starting around this tree, right?  
**[0:38:00-0:38:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:38:00):**  And all you're really trying to do is improve the soil.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:38:04):**  And then you have a bunch more insects.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:38:06):**  And then what happens?  
**[0:38:07-0:38:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:38:07):**  Lizards come to eat the insects and small birds come to eat those insects and then larger  
**[0:38:13-0:38:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:38:13):**  birds come to eat the lizards.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:38:15):**  So you know, just by putting down some mulch in an effort to improve your soil is like,  
**[0:38:23-0:38:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:38:23):**  wow, like now there's all these bugs and now there's these reptiles and now there's more  
**[0:38:28-0:38:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:38:28):**  predator birds and they're helping me.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:38:32):**  You know, I don't need to put chicken…  
**[0:38:33-0:38:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:38:33):**  You start to realize just how interconnected the whole process is.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:38:36):**  If you improve one part of an ecosystem, it starts to run away on you with all the other  
**[0:38:40-0:38:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:38:40):**  improvements that come out as a byproduct.  
**[0:38:44-0:38:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:38:44):**  Totally and it really helps when you're out there, you know, sweating your butt off with  
**[0:38:49-0:38:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:38:49):**  an acid on and then shedding day after day.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:38:52):**  You know what I mean?  
**[0:38:53-0:38:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:38:53):**  To see it.  
**[0:38:54-0:38:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:38:54):**  Like if we didn't have that feedback, I don't know how long I would last out here.  
**[0:38:57-0:38:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:38:57):**  Sure.  
**[0:38:58-0:39:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:38:58):**  But thank God that you have it because you hear that little bird chirp, that new little  
**[0:39:05-0:39:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:39:05):**  chirp and you're like, I never heard that bird chirp before.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:39:08):**  What is that?  
**[0:39:09-0:39:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:39:09):**  You know?  
**[0:39:10-0:39:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:39:10):**  And then you look up and you realize there's a whole army of tiny birds chasing off two  
**[0:39:15-0:39:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:39:15):**  toucans that just tried to rob their nest of their eggs.  
**[0:39:18-0:39:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:39:18):**  You know what I mean?  
**[0:39:19-0:39:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:39:19):**  There's a whole like squadron in the air.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:39:22):**  So you get a lot of entertainment out of it.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:39:25):**  You know, it's fantastic.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:39:26):**  I have a friend, she wants to do an off-grid project somewhere in Iceland and she's really  
**[0:39:32-0:39:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:39:32):**  worried about, you know, she's moving out of a city, moving out of DC.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:39:39):**  She wanted to ask me some questions and I was like, sure, go ahead.  
**[0:39:42-0:39:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:39:42):**  You know?  
**[0:39:43-0:39:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:39:43):**  And she's like, ask me all these like existential questions.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:39:46):**  I thought she was going to ask me how to do like a gravity fed water system or something.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:39:50):**  And she's like, how do you deal with the loneliness and the isolation?  
**[0:39:55-0:40:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:39:55):**  And I was like, look, these questions are so easy to answer because when you get out  
**[0:40:00-0:40:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:40:00):**  there, like you, these questions will disappear.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:40:04):**  You know, when you start to see an ecosystem rejuvenating and you're in it, that becomes  
**[0:40:11-0:40:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:40:11):**  your entertainment.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:40:13):**  You know, and the feeling you get from doing some purposeful, really like deliberate work  
**[0:40:20-0:40:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:40:20):**  that you see such a positive result from it is like sort of this, this existential on  
**[0:40:28-0:40:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:40:28):**  we are this malaise that everyone is suffering from that.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:40:32):**  Let me get on Amazon Prime and order some stuff to cure my malaise.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:40:36):**  It goes away.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:40:38):**  So the, it's not, you know, it is a very human thing I think for us to be doing is, you know,  
**[0:40:47-0:40:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:40:47):**  it's not so, it's not as selfless as people think is what I'm trying to say.  
**[0:40:52-0:40:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:40:52):**  Sure.  
**[0:40:53-0:40:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:40:53):**  It's like to get that feedback by seeing the wildlife is one thing, but also to cure your  
**[0:40:57-0:41:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:40:57):**  own, your own sort of urban boredom.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:41:02):**  Sure, just feel better about the impact that you're having on what you have access to.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:41:08):**  I know that was a big thing for me.  
**[0:41:10-0:41:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:41:10):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:41:12):**  So I think that there's a, you know, to kind of go back to where I started with the conservation  
**[0:41:18-0:41:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:41:18):**  on one side and like the human side on the other is to realize that these, these two  
**[0:41:23-0:41:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:41:23):**  sides really can be combined.  
**[0:41:25-0:41:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:41:25):**  It can really be one, you know, that you're not, because you're as a human then in the  
**[0:41:32-0:41:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:41:32):**  ecosystem and really in the ecosystem, you, you find yourself like really healing and  
**[0:41:39-0:41:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:41:39):**  curing yourself of a lot of, a lot of problems you didn't even know you had.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:41:44):**  Attention span, like maybe you didn't have a great group, good attention span, but you  
**[0:41:49-0:41:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:41:49):**  know, when you're out there doing things, I mean the last two days I've been harvesting  
**[0:41:52-0:41:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:41:52):**  cacao and you know, I have all these little mountains of cacao piled up in the, in the  
**[0:41:58-0:42:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:41:58):**  field and there's probably about 80 cacao piled up in each mountain and I have, you  
**[0:42:03-0:42:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:42:03):**  know, nine mountains piled up and each one weighs a pound or two.  
**[0:42:08-0:42:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:42:08):**  And I think that like, you know, I used to go to the gym.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:42:11):**  I mean, I can move 720 pounds, you know, and I'm, you know, and I'm running around  
**[0:42:19-0:42:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:42:19):**  and it resulted in something useful.  
**[0:42:22-0:42:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:42:22):**  It didn't just move something arbitrarily.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:42:24):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:42:25):**  You know, exactly.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:42:26):**  It's like, wow.  
**[0:42:28-0:42:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:42:28):**  I just like move 720 pounds around and I'm also like running around a 20,000 square meter  
**[0:42:34-0:42:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:42:34):**  area doing it.  
**[0:42:36-0:42:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:42:36):**  Yeah, exactly, and you're outside, you're not like in a building with air conditioning  
**[0:42:40-0:42:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:42:40):**  and yeah.  
**[0:42:41-0:42:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:42:41):**  You know, I was like, Oh yeah, sometimes I miss the gym, not cause it was hard, you know,  
**[0:42:47-0:42:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:42:47):**  it was easy.  
**[0:42:48-0:42:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:42:48):**  It was easy.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:42:49):**  It was easy.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:42:50):**  It was air conditioned.  
**[0:42:51-0:42:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:42:51):**  I have, you know, caterpillars in my shirt, you know, it's, I mean, you know, not sweating.  
**[0:42:56-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:42:56):**  I don't have like, you know, it's just, so there's a lot of, you know, get on the  
**[0:43:01-0:43:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:43:01):**  incline treadmill is a lot easier than climbing up and down a 40 degree incline, a cacao field  
**[0:43:07-0:43:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:43:07):**  hauling out the pods.  
**[0:43:09-0:43:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:43:09):**  You know what I mean?  
**[0:43:10-0:43:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:43:10):**  It's relatively, it's likely a lot easier to go to the gym.  
**[0:43:13-0:43:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:43:13):**  You know, but like I said, at the end of it, there's not that feeling of, of reward, real  
**[0:43:21-0:43:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:43:21):**  reward of what I see as being a much more real reward.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:43:25):**  Well, so let's explore that more because that is often what people either hesitate in, in  
**[0:43:31-0:43:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:43:31):**  getting something like this started or are kind of like their apprehensions is, is the  
**[0:43:36-0:43:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:43:36):**  lifestyle aspect.  
**[0:43:38-0:43:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:43:38):**  And you live quite simply.  
**[0:43:39-0:43:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:43:39):**  I know that your, your lifestyle is still completely off grid as far as I know.  
**[0:43:45-0:43:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:43:45):**  And you built your own house.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:43:46):**  I mean, you're responsible for a lot of your own consumption.  
**[0:43:50-0:43:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:43:50):**  Though I don't know of anybody who's, who's got a hundred percent down and I wouldn't  
**[0:43:55-0:43:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:43:55):**  advise someone to try, but tell me about how that kind of evolved because, you know, you  
**[0:43:59-0:44:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:43:59):**  said you started by living on tents on your land and talk about the evolution and some  
**[0:44:04-0:44:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:44:04):**  of the challenges to getting where you are now.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:44:07):**  Yeah.  
**[0:44:08-0:44:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:44:08):**  You know, we came with a tent.  
**[0:44:12-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:44:12):**  It was in the middle of our four trenches that we dug out for, you know, classic natural  
**[0:44:19-0:44:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:44:19):**  building style rubble trench foundations.  
**[0:44:22-0:44:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:44:22):**  And we had a single burner gas stove.  
**[0:44:27-0:44:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:44:27):**  And when I look back and I see how much more comfortable I am now, relatively to then,  
**[0:44:33-0:44:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:44:33):**  I don't really know how I got through it.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:44:35):**  I think it's just because we were working very, very hard.  
**[0:44:38-0:44:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:44:38):**  And by the time you hit the sleeping bag at night, you just conked out.  
**[0:44:43-0:44:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:44:43):**  The first four to five months.  
**[0:44:45-0:44:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:44:45):**  So it's really not anything else to think about except getting our first roof up over  
**[0:44:50-0:44:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:44:50):**  our head.  
**[0:44:51-0:44:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:44:51):**  We, we moved on to the land at the end of July and the rainy season starts in the middle  
**[0:44:55-0:44:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:44:55):**  of September.  
**[0:44:57-0:45:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:44:57):**  So we had August, September, October, November, we had five months to get our roof up.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:45:03):**  And like I said, we didn't, if we had started, if we followed the rules, you know, the natural  
**[0:45:07-0:45:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:45:07):**  building newbie rules and, you know, started with a nice small little structure, we would  
**[0:45:12-0:45:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:45:12):**  have been fine, but we didn't.  
**[0:45:13-0:45:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:45:13):**  We're like, no, we're going to build an ecological regeneration center.  
**[0:45:18-0:45:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:45:18):**  We have no idea what we're doing, but that's what we're going to do.  
**[0:45:22-0:45:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:45:22):**  And so we started with four, four structures.  
**[0:45:26-0:45:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:45:26):**  And by the beginning of December, we didn't have a roof on any of them.  
**[0:45:31-0:45:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:45:31):**  We had rings and rings of earth bags and we had bamboo pillars up to eventually hold the  
**[0:45:37-0:45:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:45:37):**  roof that was going to go up.  
**[0:45:40-0:45:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:45:40):**  And yeah, we were just filling bags every day, putting up, you know, earth bags.  
**[0:45:45-0:45:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:45:45):**  And that was, that was crazy.  
**[0:45:47-0:45:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:45:47):**  When I came back to that, I'm like, we were crazy.  
**[0:45:51-0:45:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:45:51):**  Like what were we thinking?  
**[0:45:53-0:46:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:45:53):**  I mean, you know, we didn't have a shower, but thankfully we have a very clean spring  
**[0:46:00-0:46:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:46:00):**  on our land with a natural lagoon that we could go down and we could bathe and swim  
**[0:46:06-0:46:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:46:06):**  and get clean water.  
**[0:46:08-0:46:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:46:08):**  So that was a light, a light of God's.  
**[0:46:11-0:46:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:46:11):**  One thing I just want to interject with people if they're doing any sort of off-grid living  
**[0:46:16-0:46:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:46:16):**  is make sure you have your water source and you know where it is and how you're going  
**[0:46:20-0:46:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:46:20):**  to get the water from it to where you're living.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:46:23):**  That should absolutely be your number one primary concern.  
**[0:46:26-0:46:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:46:26):**  Okay.  
**[0:46:27-0:46:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:46:27):**  Yeah, because like you mentioned the last time we spoke, it seems like people really  
**[0:46:32-0:46:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:46:32):**  over estimate or overcompensate for the energy portion of living off grid.  
**[0:46:37-0:46:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:46:37):**  That under plan for water.  
**[0:46:40-0:46:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:46:40):**  And tell me about how, is that how you thought of it from the beginning and what, like how  
**[0:46:45-0:46:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:46:45):**  quickly did that reality set in?  
**[0:46:48-0:46:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:46:48):**  You know, I had done a little bit of reading about, you know, why people abandon projects  
**[0:46:55-0:47:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:46:55):**  and the number one reason was not having a water source and not realizing how hard life  
**[0:47:01-0:47:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:47:01):**  would be that when, you know, you didn't have a faucet to turn on and water to come out  
**[0:47:06-0:47:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:47:06):**  of it, like just how impossible it is to live.  
**[0:47:11-0:47:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:47:11):**  You can't drink, you can't brush your teeth, you can't clean yourself, you can't wash clothes,  
**[0:47:14-0:47:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:47:14):**  you can't cook.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:47:15):**  That's it.  
**[0:47:16-0:47:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:47:16):**  You know, put out power.  
**[0:47:18-0:47:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:47:18):**  You have a little propane stove or a high efficiency rocket stove burner or something  
**[0:47:23-0:47:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:47:23):**  to get started and you're okay eating one pot meals for a couple of months.  
**[0:47:28-0:47:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:47:28):**  I mean, you're okay.  
**[0:47:30-0:47:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:47:30):**  You can get by.  
**[0:47:33-0:47:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:47:33):**  You know, also in terms of charging things, I mean a decent little fold out solar panel  
**[0:47:43-0:47:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:47:43):**  charger with a USB for phone and tablet.  
**[0:47:46-0:47:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:47:46):**  I mean, you can get by with that for a while too.  
**[0:47:50-0:47:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:47:50):**  We still do that now.  
**[0:47:51-0:47:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:47:51):**  We still put our fold out solar panels down to charge our phones and our tablets.  
**[0:47:58-0:48:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:47:58):**  We have a little bit of a bigger system now.  
**[0:48:00-0:48:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:48:00):**  I run my blender, but before that I ran my blender on the generator.  
**[0:48:06-0:48:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:48:06):**  So you know, we're much more comfortable now.  
**[0:48:09-0:48:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:48:09):**  We have a shower, we have three structures out of the four.  
**[0:48:12-0:48:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:48:12):**  We still haven't gotten around to building the fourth one, but we think now it might  
**[0:48:15-0:48:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:48:15):**  be a cow processing facility, but that's always evolving.  
**[0:48:20-0:48:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:48:20):**  So it's good to leave yourself some space to change your mind about things.  
**[0:48:24-0:48:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:48:24):**  And yeah, we're much more comfortable now.  
**[0:48:27-0:48:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:48:27):**  We're okay, but still, I mean in terms of lifestyle, I'm not really special.  
**[0:48:36-0:48:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:48:36):**  I mean, I've always been a big reader.  
**[0:48:39-0:48:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:48:39):**  I love to read, but I love social media.  
**[0:48:43-0:48:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:48:43):**  I love YouTube.  
**[0:48:45-0:48:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:48:45):**  I liked entertaining myself, like getting on Netflix and binge watching three seasons  
**[0:48:53-0:48:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:48:53):**  of the Sons of Anarchy in a day.  
**[0:48:56-0:48:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:48:56):**  I liked doing all that stuff.  
**[0:48:57-0:49:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:48:57):**  I mean, I wasn't like a monk living in a city.  
**[0:49:00-0:49:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:49:00):**  I was a city person.  
**[0:49:02-0:49:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:49:02):**  And I have to say that I don't think the adaptation is as difficult as a lot of people presume  
**[0:49:11-0:49:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:49:11):**  it's going to be and that they're going to need these things.  
**[0:49:15-0:49:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:49:15):**  Because like I said, there is entertainment if you're open to that style of entertainment  
**[0:49:20-0:49:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:49:20):**  to take the place of those other things.  
**[0:49:23-0:49:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:49:23):**  There are squadrons of birds flying overhead.  
**[0:49:25-0:49:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:49:25):**  There are toucans having fights with other birds.  
**[0:49:29-0:49:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:49:29):**  There are little electric lizards running around doing God knows what they're doing.  
**[0:49:34-0:49:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:49:34):**  There are ant colonies going around on highways with leaves constructing their houses, whatever  
**[0:49:42-0:49:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:49:42):**  it is they're doing.  
**[0:49:43-0:49:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:49:43):**  But there's all sorts of things to entertain you if you want to call it that and keep your  
**[0:49:49-0:49:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:49:49):**  mind occupied when you're doing a project like this.  
**[0:49:54-0:50:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:49:54):**  You're also problem solving intensively on a daily basis, which I think is something  
**[0:50:02-0:50:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:50:02):**  that people living in cities or suburbs where life is pretty much taken care of for you.  
**[0:50:10-0:50:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:50:10):**  Your water and your power and everything is brought in and all your waste is taken out.  
**[0:50:17-0:50:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:50:17):**  They don't get to problem solve.  
**[0:50:19-0:50:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:50:19):**  I think when people don't have an opportunity to problem solve in ways that it's not like,  
**[0:50:25-0:50:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:50:25):**  oh, let me do this strategy meeting for this whatever, whatever people do with their jobs.  
**[0:50:33-0:50:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:50:33):**  I have no idea what normal people do for work either.  
**[0:50:38-0:50:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:50:38):**  Whatever they do for a living.  
**[0:50:40-0:50:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:50:40):**  Not that type of problem solving, but real problem solving.  
**[0:50:44-0:50:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:50:44):**  My water source is a little bit down this hill and I want to get some pressure so that  
**[0:50:49-0:50:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:50:49):**  I can take a shower.  
**[0:50:52-0:50:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:50:52):**  What am I going to do?  
**[0:50:53-0:50:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:50:53):**  You know what I mean?  
**[0:50:55-0:50:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:50:55):**  That's a real problem to be solved.  
**[0:50:58-0:51:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:50:58):**  For sure.  
**[0:51:01-0:51:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:51:01):**  I don't have a lot of sand in my...  
**[0:51:03-0:51:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:51:03):**  I don't have a high clay content soil, but I want to make this cool mud plaster that  
**[0:51:08-0:51:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:51:08):**  I read about.  
**[0:51:09-0:51:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:51:09):**  Okay, what am I going to do?  
**[0:51:12-0:51:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:51:12):**  These questions come up all the time.  
**[0:51:16-0:51:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:51:16):**  I have this garden area that I want to close off a little bit and I've got some big rocks  
**[0:51:22-0:51:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:51:22):**  and okay, what am I going to do?  
**[0:51:24-0:51:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:51:24):**  It could be like the simplest thing.  
**[0:51:26-0:51:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:51:26):**  It could be from building a rock wall to making a gravity fed water system to finally putting  
**[0:51:32-0:51:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:51:32):**  up your first solar panel.  
**[0:51:34-0:51:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:51:34):**  Every day you have interesting problems to solve and you can solve them.  
**[0:51:40-0:51:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:51:40):**  You have an opportunity to solve them and that will engage your mind in a way, I think,  
**[0:51:46-0:51:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:51:46):**  that it did for me that you don't have this craving to watch all four seasons of The Wire  
**[0:51:53-0:51:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:51:53):**  in one day or Game of Thrones.  
**[0:51:56-0:52:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:51:56):**  Or whatever it might be.  
**[0:52:00-0:52:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:52:00):**  For me, what I learned when I first started to live very, very basically, it actually  
**[0:52:05-0:52:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:52:05):**  was well before I got into natural building or permaculture.  
**[0:52:07-0:52:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:52:07):**  I used to work on trail crews in the national parks and we'd go out on these backcountry  
**[0:52:13-0:52:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:52:13):**  tours where we weren't even allowed to bring any real machinery because they're protected  
**[0:52:17-0:52:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:52:17):**  zones and you had to use only hand tools.  
**[0:52:19-0:52:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:52:19):**  We were in tents for a month at a time.  
**[0:52:21-0:52:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:52:21):**  I camped in the Shoshone.  
**[0:52:23-0:52:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:52:23):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:52:24-0:52:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:52:24):**  You know what I mean.  
**[0:52:28-0:52:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:52:28):**  It turns out you don't need any of this stuff.  
**[0:52:31-0:52:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:52:31):**  There's an adjustment period and it's not like you don't still enjoy it when you have  
**[0:52:34-0:52:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:52:34):**  access to it, whether it be binge watching a show or hanging out on YouTube or any of  
**[0:52:41-0:52:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:52:41):**  these other conveniences that people have gotten really used to.  
**[0:52:43-0:52:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:52:43):**  Those are really recent and people were totally fine.  
**[0:52:47-0:52:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:52:47):**  They had socialized.  
**[0:52:48-0:52:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:52:48):**  You would trust.  
**[0:52:49-0:52:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:52:49):**  You were fine before.  
**[0:52:51-0:52:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:52:51):**  I mean, I know for myself personally, it was really eye-opening just to realize how little  
**[0:52:58-0:53:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:52:58):**  you actually need to be actually a lot happier than when you had so many conveniences.  
**[0:53:05-0:53:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:53:05):**  It really kind of meant a shift for me of not going back to a lot of these things or  
**[0:53:09-0:53:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:53:09):**  at least keeping in perspective that they're non-essential and when they're not around,  
**[0:53:15-0:53:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:53:15):**  it's not a reason to panic.  
**[0:53:16-0:53:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:53:16):**  It's just a reason to adjust.  
**[0:53:21-0:53:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:53:21):**  What I found to be much more challenging is the strain on the relationships that you have  
**[0:53:26-0:53:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:53:26):**  with people when you're in those tight quarters and many of you are not used to living in  
**[0:53:33-0:53:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:53:33):**  communal systems or in close-knit families.  
**[0:53:37-0:53:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:53:37):**  I grew up with five kids so it wasn't that hard for me.  
**[0:53:40-0:53:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:53:40):**  Right.  
**[0:53:41-0:53:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:53:41):**  I don't know.  
**[0:53:44-0:53:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:53:44):**  You don't have to get into any personal details, but was that a big aspect of the transition  
**[0:53:48-0:53:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:53:48):**  into this lifestyle?  
**[0:53:49-0:53:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:53:49):**  Was it just how much more time you spent with your partner?  
**[0:53:52-0:53:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:53:52):**  I mean, by my partner.  
**[0:53:55-0:53:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:53:55):**  I love Lauren so much, but we throw hammers at each other.  
**[0:53:59-0:54:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:53:59):**  When you've got two people off the grid in the middle of nowhere, there's all the filters.  
**[0:54:08-0:54:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:54:08):**  There's no filters.  
**[0:54:11-0:54:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:54:11):**  I can't even tell you how many times the expression, you're not the boss of me.  
**[0:54:16-0:54:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:54:16):**  Oh, yes, I am.  
**[0:54:17-0:54:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:54:17):**  I'm like, are we in the fourth grade?  
**[0:54:20-0:54:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:54:20):**  You're not the boss of me.  
**[0:54:23-0:54:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:54:23):**  Yes, I am.  
**[0:54:24-0:54:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:54:24):**  I mean, seriously.  
**[0:54:25-0:54:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:54:25):**  It can get really intense.  
**[0:54:26-0:54:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:54:26):**  Sure.  
**[0:54:27-0:54:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:54:27):**  I think the larger vision really helps to hold us together.  
**[0:54:43-0:54:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:54:43):**  We've really come to, as we've adjusted and it's taken some time, but holding on to that  
**[0:54:48-0:54:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:54:48):**  larger vision, we're doing something here that's bigger than us.  
**[0:54:53-0:54:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:54:53):**  One day, Oliver, we were having, to put that in a real perspective, what does that mean?  
**[0:54:58-0:55:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:54:58):**  We were having some stupid argument.  
**[0:55:01-0:55:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:55:01):**  It was getting pretty vocal when you're out in the middle of nowhere.  
**[0:55:06-0:55:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:55:06):**  Nobody's going to hear you.  
**[0:55:07-0:55:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:55:07):**  It's like, whatever.  
**[0:55:08-0:55:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:55:08):**  I'm just going to start screaming.  
**[0:55:10-0:55:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:55:10):**  This hummingbird comes down, this big hummingbird, one of those big jeweled ones that's red and  
**[0:55:16-0:55:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:55:16):**  green and gold.  
**[0:55:17-0:55:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:55:17):**  It just flew right in my face.  
**[0:55:20-0:55:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:55:20):**  I think it was like three inches from my nose and it was just hovering there, like looking  
**[0:55:26-0:55:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:55:26):**  at me, kind of annoyed.  
**[0:55:28-0:55:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:55:28):**  And then it went over to one and it was like humming in his face and then it just hummed  
**[0:55:33-0:55:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:55:33):**  off.  
**[0:55:34-0:55:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:55:34):**  We were like, wow.  
**[0:55:38-0:55:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:55:38):**  I guess we're just disturbing the birds.  
**[0:55:40-0:55:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:55:40):**  Maybe it's only you out there as far as people, but yeah, there are other things out here  
**[0:55:52-0:55:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:55:52):**  too.  
**[0:55:53-0:55:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:55:53):**  There are other things out here.  
**[0:55:54-0:56:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:55:54):**  This hummingbird was just like, hey, can you guys shut up?  
**[0:56:01-0:56:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:56:01):**  There definitely will be some strain.  
**[0:56:06-0:56:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:56:06):**  There's no distraction.  
**[0:56:09-0:56:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:56:09):**  You and your small group of people, your partner, whoever it is, day in and day out.  
**[0:56:18-0:56:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:56:18):**  There's no utopia out here.  
**[0:56:20-0:56:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:56:20):**  You bring all your stuff with you, all your issues and all your stuff comes with you.  
**[0:56:26-0:56:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:56:26):**  You might be in your own healing process.  
**[0:56:29-0:56:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:56:29):**  But it's like coming out of this self-care, yoga world.  
**[0:56:36-0:56:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:56:36):**  People ask me these questions, so was it a major healing process for you?  
**[0:56:41-0:56:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:56:41):**  And I'm like, well, yeah, I guess it was if I stopped to think about it.  
**[0:56:46-0:56:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:56:46):**  You know.  
**[0:56:47-0:56:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:56:47):**  Right.  
**[0:56:48-0:56:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:56:48):**  But at the time, that's not probably what was on your mind.  
**[0:56:50-0:56:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:56:50):**  No, at the time, that's not what's on my mind.  
**[0:56:52-0:56:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:56:52):**  And you know what?  
**[0:56:53-0:57:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:56:53):**  I think that the real deep down cellular level healing, it's just like what happens on those  
**[0:57:03-0:57:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:57:03):**  acres of land that you're not actively managing.  
**[0:57:06-0:57:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:57:06):**  You know, it's like maybe if I'm not in here and like my subconscious psyche meddling around  
**[0:57:11-0:57:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:57:11):**  all the time and I just get out here and do some good meaningful work, that I see the  
**[0:57:15-0:57:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:57:15):**  result and I problem solve and I'm in the dirt and I'm in the nature and I'm looking  
**[0:57:20-0:57:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:57:20):**  at the birds.  
**[0:57:21-0:57:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:57:21):**  Like maybe that stuff will start to take care of itself.  
**[0:57:25-0:57:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:57:25):**  And that really has been the outcome.  
**[0:57:27-0:57:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:57:27):**  Some people ask me about like being in nature and healing and using nature as healing.  
**[0:57:33-0:57:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:57:33):**  I'm like, yeah, but just like let go of thinking about it.  
**[0:57:37-0:57:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:57:37):**  Sure.  
**[0:57:38-0:57:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:57:38):**  Don't force it.  
**[0:57:39-0:57:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:57:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:57:40-0:57:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:57:40):**  Don't force it.  
**[0:57:41-0:57:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:57:41):**  Just go, go do what you need to do and let that, let that happen as it will.  
**[0:57:46-0:57:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:57:46):**  Cause it is an incredibly, I think that's one thing a lot of people are attracted to  
**[0:57:50-0:57:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:57:50):**  to be in nature.  
**[0:57:51-0:57:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:57:51):**  I want to be in nature, you know?  
**[0:57:54-0:57:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:57:54):**  I'm like, you know, okay here, I mean, I don't know about you, but like every form of nature  
**[0:57:59-0:58:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:57:59):**  either has its snakes, scorpions, mosquitoes, malaria, dengue, ischmaniasis, West Nile virus.  
**[0:58:07-0:58:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:58:07):**  I mean, there's all kinds of things that come out of nature when you're really in it every  
**[0:58:12-0:58:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:58:12):**  day.  
**[0:58:13-0:58:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:58:13):**  I'm certainly not out there working in flip flops and sundress.  
**[0:58:16-0:58:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:58:16):**  You know, I'm covered from head to toe.  
**[0:58:19-0:58:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:58:19):**  You know, I'm protecting myself from vegetation, from, you know, all sorts of things out there  
**[0:58:23-0:58:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:58:23):**  in the bush.  
**[0:58:25-0:58:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:58:25):**  And you know, working in nature a lot of times is not what people think it's going to be.  
**[0:58:30-0:58:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:58:30):**  You know, you're not just winding, making flower wreaths.  
**[0:58:34-0:58:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:58:34):**  You know what I mean?  
**[0:58:35-0:58:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:58:35):**  It's like, it's hard.  
**[0:58:36-0:58:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:58:36):**  Yeah.  
**[0:58:37-0:58:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:58:37):**  It's really hard work.  
**[0:58:38-0:58:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:58:38):**  There's a lot of drudgery to it.  
**[0:58:39-0:58:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:58:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:58:40-0:58:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:58:40):**  It's not.  
**[0:58:41-0:58:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:58:41):**  There's a lot of drudgery.  
**[0:58:42-0:58:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:58:42):**  And you know, and I think that, but at the end of it, and I'm not even talking about  
**[0:58:47-0:58:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:58:47):**  the end of the day, maybe it's at the end of the month or the end of the year.  
**[0:58:52-0:58:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:58:52):**  Like I sleep like a champ.  
**[0:58:54-0:58:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:58:54):**  I think I sleep like nine hours a day.  
**[0:58:57-0:59:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:58:57):**  My whole life I was lucky to sleep like six hours a day.  
**[0:59:01-0:59:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:59:01):**  You know what I mean?  
**[0:59:02-0:59:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:59:02):**  Five.  
**[0:59:03-0:59:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:59:03):**  You know, I was a terrible sleeper.  
**[0:59:05-0:59:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:59:05):**  I didn't have the best digestive system.  
**[0:59:07-0:59:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:59:07):**  I had a lot of like, sort of like weird little anxiety things.  
**[0:59:11-0:59:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:59:11):**  I can honestly say all that stuff is horrible.  
**[0:59:14-0:59:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:59:14):**  I eat like a champ.  
**[0:59:16-0:59:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:59:16):**  I digest like a champ.  
**[0:59:17-0:59:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:59:17):**  I sleep like a champ.  
**[0:59:18-0:59:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:59:18):**  You know, it's, yeah, you're so much closer to all those rhythms and the, you know, the  
**[0:59:23-0:59:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:59:23):**  correct processes.  
**[0:59:26-0:59:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:59:26):**  You know, I get up with the light, I go to bed with the light, you know, it's all those  
**[0:59:30-0:59:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:59:30):**  things they really, they really help you when you're in it.  
**[0:59:34-0:59:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:59:34):**  And that's what we were about to live like, you know, and then one thing I just want to  
**[0:59:40-0:59:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:59:40):**  mention as you know, cause I, I want to be all, I used to call people that were all like,  
**[0:59:44-0:59:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:59:44):**  you know, the yogi or the vow, like I'm yogi or the do, you know, we do live very simply.  
**[0:59:50-0:59:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:59:50):**  We do live very close to the earth, you know, we grow food, we harvest food.  
**[0:59:54-0:59:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:59:54):**  I cook food that I harvest the same day.  
**[0:59:58-1:00:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=0:59:58):**  You know, we probably consume, I'd say at this point about 40% of what we grow and the  
**[1:00:05-1:00:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:00:05):**  other 60% we buy that that number will, of course it'll change, you know, it'll, we'll  
**[1:00:10-1:00:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:00:10):**  start the longer we're here, the more we'll grow and you know, the more we'll live as  
**[1:00:15-1:00:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:00:15):**  good.  
**[1:00:16-1:00:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:00:16):**  And it's not to be a hundred percent self sufficient, like you said, that's really,  
**[1:00:21-1:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:00:21):**  it's not viable.  
**[1:00:22-1:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:00:22):**  You're going to, it's, it's, you're just going to be poor and depressed and you know, it's,  
**[1:00:27-1:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:00:27):**  it's not really, that's not the aim.  
**[1:00:29-1:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:00:29):**  The aim is not complete self-sufficiency.  
**[1:00:31-1:00:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:00:31):**  The aim is, you know, to have a lot of good things that we like to have around us and  
**[1:00:35-1:00:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:00:35):**  to enjoy it.  
**[1:00:36-1:00:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:00:36):**  And we want to go support our local markets, we go shopping.  
**[1:00:40-1:00:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:00:40):**  It's not a big deal.  
**[1:00:41-1:00:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:00:41):**  So I just want to be like really clear about the things that you need to do to get started  
**[1:00:49-1:00:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:00:49):**  and how things evolve is sometimes people like you have to put things in the perspective  
**[1:00:56-1:01:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:00:56):**  of how you were living before and then how likely it is that you're, you're living on  
**[1:01:01-1:01:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:01:01):**  your land or how likely it is you're living on the earth and, and realize that maybe having  
**[1:01:08-1:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:01:08):**  a gas powered pump to get the water from your spring up to your tank so that you can run  
**[1:01:14-1:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:01:14):**  it down the tube to have a gravity fed shower is not the end of the world.  
**[1:01:19-1:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:01:19):**  Yeah.  
**[1:01:20-1:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:01:20):**  That if you're, if you're putting a liter of gas in your gas powered pump twice a month,  
**[1:01:25-1:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:01:25):**  which is about what we do, you are not contributing to the fossil fuel crisis the same way you  
**[1:01:34-1:01:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:01:34):**  were when you drove your car to work every day.  
**[1:01:36-1:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:01:36):**  Absolutely.  
**[1:01:37-1:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:01:37):**  And even if you took a bus to work every day.  
**[1:01:39-1:01:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:01:39):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[1:01:40-1:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:01:40):**  I mean keeping that in perspective and not getting caught up on this idea of perfectionism  
**[1:01:44-1:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:01:44):**  or like, you know, there's no virtue unless you go all the way.  
**[1:01:48-1:01:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:01:48):**  I agree.  
**[1:01:49-1:01:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:01:49):**  All the way.  
**[1:01:50-1:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:01:50):**  Yeah.  
**[1:01:51-1:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:01:51):**  It's that zealous mindset that, that often can alienate other people who want to make  
**[1:01:55-1:01:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:01:55):**  progressive steps in that direction, but feel like they're not accepted by a community that's  
**[1:01:59-1:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:01:59):**  constantly criticizing every little thing that they didn't do yet.  
**[1:02:02-1:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:02:02):**  I completely agree.  
**[1:02:04-1:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:02:04):**  Exactly.  
**[1:02:05-1:02:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:02:05):**  You know, we have a gas powered pump.  
**[1:02:08-1:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:02:08):**  We still use it.  
**[1:02:10-1:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:02:10):**  I mean, you know, we're looking forward to the day we have a solar powered pump.  
**[1:02:15-1:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:02:15):**  But you know, these things, the newer technology, it costs more money.  
**[1:02:19-1:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:02:19):**  We're not there yet.  
**[1:02:21-1:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:02:21):**  Now we're harvesting cacao.  
**[1:02:23-1:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:02:23):**  So hopefully we will be.  
**[1:02:25-1:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:02:25):**  But I mean, we keep these things, like I said, like in perspective, we don't have a trash  
**[1:02:29-1:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:02:29):**  removal service.  
**[1:02:31-1:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:02:31):**  So we accumulate very little trash.  
**[1:02:34-1:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:02:34):**  Like one of those little, a tiny little shopping bag, like a plastic shopping bag.  
**[1:02:40-1:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:02:40):**  It takes me two weeks to accumulate enough trash to fill up a tiny little bag.  
**[1:02:47-1:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:02:47):**  Sometimes three.  
**[1:02:48-1:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:02:48):**  I mean, everything that I, it might look like a piece of trash, like a dead battery or a  
**[1:02:56-1:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:02:56):**  lid to a jar that's rusted and I can't reuse it anymore.  
**[1:03:00-1:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:03:00):**  It gets plastered into my walls.  
**[1:03:01-1:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:03:01):**  There is so much trash plastered into my back walls.  
**[1:03:04-1:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:03:04):**  It's like, cause I don't want to have to throw it away.  
**[1:03:07-1:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:03:07):**  I don't want to have to haul it out.  
**[1:03:10-1:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:03:10):**  You know, and I'll tell you what, like, I don't know.  
**[1:03:13-1:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:03:13):**  I mean, you know how it is.  
**[1:03:14-1:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:03:14):**  And you lived in Guatemala.  
**[1:03:16-1:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:03:16):**  I mean, people in South America are not really happy when you throw, put your trash in their  
**[1:03:20-1:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:03:20):**  garbage can.  
**[1:03:21-1:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:03:21):**  They don't have the luxury of like, you know, just like these massive trash pickup services.  
**[1:03:29-1:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:03:29):**  Like everybody's paying to have their trash picked up.  
**[1:03:31-1:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:03:31):**  So it's like, don't, you know, I've been yelled at.  
**[1:03:34-1:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:03:34):**  Don't put that there.  
**[1:03:35-1:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:03:35):**  That's private.  
**[1:03:36-1:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:03:36):**  You know what I mean?  
**[1:03:37-1:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:03:37):**  So I, we accumulate very little trash.  
**[1:03:40-1:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:03:40):**  We use very little gas.  
**[1:03:42-1:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:03:42):**  We leave our Finca once a week in our car.  
**[1:03:45-1:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:03:45):**  Yes, we have a car.  
**[1:03:46-1:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:03:46):**  We go out once a week.  
**[1:03:49-1:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:03:49):**  My partner Juan, he's a pretty good builder.  
**[1:03:52-1:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:03:52):**  He builds a lot of good, a lot of nice things by hand.  
**[1:03:54-1:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:03:54):**  He does a lot of work by hand and sometimes he gets out the circular saw and thanks to  
**[1:04:00-1:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:04:00):**  him being able to use a circular saw, we have nice bamboo structures.  
**[1:04:04-1:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:04:04):**  We're able to, and a jigsaw and he runs them on the generator.  
**[1:04:08-1:04:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:04:08):**  I mean, so like we're not perfect out here.  
**[1:04:11-1:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:04:11):**  You know what I mean?  
**[1:04:12-1:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:04:12):**  We have a generator, we have a pump, we have a car.  
**[1:04:16-1:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:04:16):**  You know, we use very little fuel relatively to people in urban or especially suburban  
**[1:04:22-1:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:04:22):**  lives where you're driving really far or you know, we don't go to Costco.  
**[1:04:29-1:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:04:29):**  We don't buy like 148 ounce containers of ketchup sheet wrapped together.  
**[1:04:36-1:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:04:36):**  You know, bring them home.  
**[1:04:37-1:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:04:37):**  Oh man, you don't do the ketchup?  
**[1:04:38-1:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:04:38):**  See, I would still be on that.  
**[1:04:39-1:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:04:39):**  I feel like you're going too far.  
**[1:04:40-1:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:04:40):**  You were going too far, you know?  
**[1:04:41-1:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:04:41):**  So it's like, I just want people to know that it's like, yeah, there isn't, there's  
**[1:04:52-1:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:04:52):**  there are compromises that you make along the way to get where you want to go.  
**[1:04:58-1:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:04:58):**  And if you're don't get paralyzed by thinking like, Oh, like, Oh, a gas pump.  
**[1:05:05-1:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:05:05):**  I mean, you know, people make faces.  
**[1:05:07-1:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:05:07):**  They're like, how do you get your water, you know, from here to there?  
**[1:05:09-1:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:05:09):**  And I'm like, well, we use the, we have a pump.  
**[1:05:11-1:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:05:11):**  Oh, how does it work?  
**[1:05:13-1:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:05:13):**  I'm like, yeah, you know, they make it.  
**[1:05:17-1:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:05:17):**  How does your life work?  
**[1:05:19-1:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:05:19):**  And I'm like, look, I can see how much gas I'm putting in that pump every, just because  
**[1:05:31-1:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:05:31):**  you can't see like everything that goes into the heating of your house, the cooling of  
**[1:05:36-1:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:05:36):**  your house.  
**[1:05:37-1:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:05:37):**  It doesn't mean it doesn't exist.  
**[1:05:40-1:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:05:40):**  It doesn't mean it doesn't exist.  
**[1:05:43-1:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:05:43):**  And because I can see it and because I have to pay for it very directly, I'm very open  
**[1:05:49-1:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:05:49):**  and aware of, and I'm very responsible for exactly how much I'm going to use.  
**[1:05:55-1:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:05:55):**  You know, and so I think that that's the, you know, that's the, where it comes in.  
**[1:06:00-1:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:06:00):**  And also like, we're doing a lot of things to make up for it.  
**[1:06:03-1:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:06:03):**  I mean, we're reforesting acres of land.  
**[1:06:06-1:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:06:06):**  Like I can actually walk into areas on my land right now and I can be like, wow, it's  
**[1:06:13-1:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:06:13):**  cooler here than it was three years ago.  
**[1:06:15-1:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:06:15):**  Oh, without a doubt.  
**[1:06:16-1:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:06:16):**  Yeah.  
**[1:06:17-1:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:06:17):**  It's shadier here than it was three years ago.  
**[1:06:20-1:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:06:20):**  Like I'm there, these trees are sequestering carbon.  
**[1:06:25-1:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:06:25):**  These trees are breathing oxygen.  
**[1:06:27-1:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:06:27):**  Like all these things that the climate scientists are telling us are the most effective terrestrial  
**[1:06:34-1:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:06:34):**  carbon sink on the planet are forests.  
**[1:06:36-1:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:06:36):**  Like I'm making a forest.  
**[1:06:39-1:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:06:39):**  So I'm not going to get to where, and I'm, you know, I'm also, you know, I have a composting  
**[1:06:44-1:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:06:44):**  toilet and I don't use a municipal water system and I don't use a municipal power system.  
**[1:06:48-1:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:06:48):**  So all these things that people sometimes get a little bit out of perspective and worked  
**[1:06:53-1:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:06:53):**  up about, it's like, you know what, it's okay.  
**[1:06:56-1:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:06:56):**  Like I'm okay with the fact that I put a liter of gas in my pump every month because I'm  
**[1:07:00-1:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:07:00):**  planting a forest and I poop into a bucket.  
**[1:07:03-1:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:07:03):**  Okay.  
**[1:07:04-1:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:07:04):**  So there.  
**[1:07:05-1:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:07:05):**  No, no, I completely agree with that.  
**[1:07:06-1:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:07:06):**  And like, it was, I think it was coming from Larry Santoyo in the LA area and his concept  
**[1:07:11-1:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:07:11):**  of paying more attention to your hand print than your footprint.  
**[1:07:15-1:07:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:07:15):**  And instead of focusing or like stressing too much about what you consume, obviously  
**[1:07:20-1:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:07:20):**  you don't want to over consume and you want to be conscious of, you know, the best ways  
**[1:07:24-1:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:07:24):**  of providing for your needs, but you should be putting at least as much effort or thought  
**[1:07:29-1:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:07:29):**  into what you're doing positively, not just to offset it, but to leave something that  
**[1:07:34-1:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:07:34):**  is, is bigger than your efforts or your consumption for later generations.  
**[1:07:39-1:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:07:39):**  And you know, I think, I think you have your priorities exactly in the right place.  
**[1:07:43-1:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:07:43):**  And with that in mind, like, can you kind of give us perhaps some advice for people  
**[1:07:48-1:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:07:48):**  who are listening and feel inspired by this project on some things that you've learned,  
**[1:07:52-1:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:07:52):**  especially through like the succession models of setting up something that, you know, when  
**[1:07:57-1:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:07:57):**  you start to plant trees or especially if you're primarily focused on perennial crops,  
**[1:08:02-1:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:08:02):**  you're not going to get a yield from that right away.  
**[1:08:05-1:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:08:05):**  It takes a while for the returns to come in about sort of planning through the stages.  
**[1:08:10-1:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:08:10):**  What are some of the most important things to consider first and how to overcome these  
**[1:08:17-1:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:08:17):**  this extended period of time before you start seeing, especially a monetary return from  
**[1:08:20-1:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:08:20):**  your investment?  
**[1:08:21-1:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:08:21):**  Right.  
**[1:08:22-1:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:08:22):**  You know, I would say definitely shelter first.  
**[1:08:28-1:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:08:28):**  I mean, if you're moving, if you're moving into a land where you don't, there's no house,  
**[1:08:33-1:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:08:33):**  you don't have to be a shed or anything, a place to live, shelter first.  
**[1:08:37-1:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:08:37):**  You can buy food until you have a roof over your head.  
**[1:08:41-1:08:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:08:41):**  But you know, have enough, have enough money in your little piggy bank that you can eat  
**[1:08:46-1:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:08:46):**  while you're building out a house or, you know, and, and I would say follow that rule.  
**[1:08:51-1:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:08:51):**  Like don't, don't break all the rules like we did.  
**[1:08:53-1:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:08:53):**  Follow the rule of like, if you don't have a house, like build something small.  
**[1:08:57-1:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:08:57):**  We should have done that.  
**[1:08:58-1:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:08:58):**  You know, that was, that was crazy.  
**[1:08:59-1:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:08:59):**  That was stupid.  
**[1:09:00-1:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:09:00):**  That was dumb.  
**[1:09:03-1:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:09:03):**  Yeah, definitely, you know, you know, build yourself out something that you can live in  
**[1:09:11-1:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:09:11):**  or if there's a shed or something that you could remake or a farmhouse, you know, do  
**[1:09:15-1:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:09:15):**  that first.  
**[1:09:18-1:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:09:18):**  Find out what, if you're moving into a new area, like it's a subtropical or tropical  
**[1:09:22-1:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:09:22):**  area or an area where you haven't lived.  
**[1:09:26-1:09:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:09:26):**  Find out what are the highest calorie, most satisfying things that you can grow in like  
**[1:09:33-1:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:09:33):**  say a three to nine month period and plant those things first.  
**[1:09:37-1:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:09:37):**  If it's, you know, potatoes or sweet potatoes or rutabaga if you're in a temperate climate  
**[1:09:43-1:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:09:43):**  or if it's, you know, cassava yucca or plantains that has like more of an eight to nine months,  
**[1:09:50-1:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:09:50):**  you know, turnover.  
**[1:09:51-1:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:09:51):**  Definitely plant those things first.  
**[1:09:55-1:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:09:55):**  Because those are major, you know, that's like a major food.  
**[1:09:59-1:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:09:59):**  It's not just something to eat, but it's filling and it's satisfying and it's nutritious and  
**[1:10:04-1:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:10:04):**  it's got fiber.  
**[1:10:05-1:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:10:05):**  And you know, these are like, as great as salad greens are, that is not the calorie  
**[1:10:10-1:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:10:10):**  count you need to be doing physical labor.  
**[1:10:13-1:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:10:13):**  No, like don't worry too much about your salads.  
**[1:10:15-1:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:10:15):**  I mean, really, like, you know, I have Malabar spinach now in containers and I have some  
**[1:10:21-1:10:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:10:21):**  tropical basil and I have like a nice little container garden of greens.  
**[1:10:24-1:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:10:24):**  You know, because I can keep that under the roof so it doesn't get battered by the rain.  
**[1:10:28-1:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:10:28):**  But you know, it's not like my, wasn't my, it's not like my major, huge major concern.  
**[1:10:36-1:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:10:36):**  It's nice to have those things, but that's, that's, that's it.  
**[1:10:38-1:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:10:38):**  It's good to have.  
**[1:10:39-1:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:10:39):**  So I would say, you know, figure out what those crops are and plant those and also understand  
**[1:10:46-1:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:10:46):**  that by planting those things first, you're also cultivating your soil.  
**[1:10:51-1:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:10:51):**  For example, here, the two things that you're working with, damaged soil, degraded soil,  
**[1:10:56-1:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:10:56):**  compacted soil.  
**[1:10:58-1:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:10:58):**  The first two things you need to really think about is shade because the only way you're  
**[1:11:03-1:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:11:03):**  going to actually compete with grass, compete with pasture is to shade it out.  
**[1:11:08-1:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:11:08):**  Unless you're going to use herbicides, which most people who listen to this probably aren't  
**[1:11:12-1:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:11:12):**  going to want to use herbicides.  
**[1:11:14-1:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:11:14):**  So plant something that provides a lot of shade, a fast growing wide canopy, big leaved  
**[1:11:20-1:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:11:20):**  tree.  
**[1:11:21-1:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:11:21):**  Whatever that is in your area, find out what it is and plant lots of them.  
**[1:11:25-1:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:11:25):**  If it provides food like a banana or a plantain, even better.  
**[1:11:30-1:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:11:30):**  And plant a good, healthy, robust, starchy root crop like a yucca or budabaga, sweet  
**[1:11:37-1:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:11:37):**  potato.  
**[1:11:39-1:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:11:39):**  Something that spreads out, doesn't require a lot of care that you got to, you get a lot  
**[1:11:42-1:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:11:42):**  of the bang for your buck.  
**[1:11:44-1:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:11:44):**  And also what these root crops do is they open soil for you.  
**[1:11:48-1:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:11:48):**  So it's like tilling without tilling.  
**[1:11:50-1:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:11:50):**  Yeah, because when I rip a big bunch of yucca out of the ground, I now have this nice aerated  
**[1:11:56-1:11:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:11:56):**  passage left for me that wasn't there before.  
**[1:11:59-1:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:11:59):**  So root crops make great...  
**[1:12:00-1:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:12:00):**  You didn't have to sweat for an hour to dig it out.  
**[1:12:02-1:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:12:02):**  I didn't have to sweat, exactly.  
**[1:12:03-1:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:12:03):**  It's great.  
**[1:12:04-1:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:12:04):**  It's like, wow, now I can put a coffee tree here or I can put a cacao plant here or something  
**[1:12:09-1:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:12:09):**  that's a little bit more fussy and I don't have to worry about it because it's got aeration,  
**[1:12:14-1:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:12:14):**  it's got drainage, it's good.  
**[1:12:17-1:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:12:17):**  So definitely plant your big biomass cover crops like a banana or plantain or some big  
**[1:12:25-1:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:12:25):**  leafy tree and plant a root crop first.  
**[1:12:31-1:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:12:31):**  From there, I call it working in chunks.  
**[1:12:36-1:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:12:36):**  Start from the center and start moving outwards from there because if you try to just do a  
**[1:12:42-1:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:12:42):**  big zone all at once, it's too much to manage at once.  
**[1:12:46-1:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:12:46):**  It's overwhelming.  
**[1:12:47-1:12:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:12:47):**  A lot of your small trees are going to die.  
**[1:12:49-1:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:12:49):**  They're going to get overwhelmed if you can't get to them.  
**[1:12:51-1:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:12:51):**  They'll get covered in vines.  
**[1:12:53-1:12:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:12:53):**  They'll be eaten by insects.  
**[1:12:55-1:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:12:55):**  So definitely go in chunks.  
**[1:12:58-1:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:12:58):**  Yeah, I mean, that's pretty much it.  
**[1:13:04-1:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:13:04):**  Once you've got your things that you get a turnover in less than a year, say anywhere  
**[1:13:10-1:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:13:10):**  from three to nine months, then you've got some soil opening and you've got some biomass  
**[1:13:18-1:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:13:18):**  started.  
**[1:13:19-1:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:13:19):**  And then the area where, say, my yucca and bananas were is now more, I've got more coffee,  
**[1:13:26-1:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:13:26):**  I've got more cacao, I've got some Brazil nut trees planted, I've got a whole bunch  
**[1:13:31-1:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:13:31):**  of things, not on Asia, different exotic fruits.  
**[1:13:35-1:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:13:35):**  So it doesn't have to stay that way.  
**[1:13:38-1:13:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:13:38):**  Whatever you're going to use as your soil tillers and soil fertilizers and canopy providers,  
**[1:13:45-1:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:13:45):**  that's temporary.  
**[1:13:47-1:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:13:47):**  And then you can plant those a little bit further out in their wake, plant the things  
**[1:13:53-1:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:13:53):**  that you want to focus on being more productive in, say, more of a three to five year future.  
**[1:14:00-1:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:14:00):**  And then put more bananas and yucca or sweet potatoes or whatever it is that you're planting  
**[1:14:05-1:14:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:14:05):**  your area a little bit further out.  
**[1:14:08-1:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:14:08):**  Harvest, cut it down, move a little bit further out.  
**[1:14:12-1:14:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:14:12):**  So that's how we work.  
**[1:14:13-1:14:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:14:13):**  We work with yucca in the ground to till the soil, bananas overhead to provide canopy and  
**[1:14:18-1:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:14:18):**  a lot of green matter.  
**[1:14:20-1:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:14:20):**  And then what was once all just bananas and yucca is now more of a polyculture, more of  
**[1:14:27-1:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:14:27):**  a perennial forest, and we just kind of keep moving in that way.  
**[1:14:32-1:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:14:32):**  That's like a kind of a tried and true sub-tropical agroforestry system that works.  
**[1:14:40-1:14:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:14:40):**  Sure, sure.  
**[1:14:41-1:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:14:41):**  Yeah, so.  
**[1:14:42-1:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:14:42):**  Yeah, those are all really good and very practical things that people can keep in mind, especially  
**[1:14:47-1:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:14:47):**  if they're starting a project with a similar context like the one that you have.  
**[1:14:51-1:14:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:14:51):**  Man, there's so many things that I would love to talk about.  
**[1:14:54-1:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:14:54):**  We covered a lot of ground the last time we chatted too about sort of the context in which  
**[1:14:58-1:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:14:58):**  people are growing and selling things in your area.  
**[1:15:01-1:15:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:15:01):**  And you know, let's plan on doing a follow up maybe in a year or so.  
**[1:15:05-1:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:15:05):**  I would love to hear how this continues to evolve and the new things that you're trying  
**[1:15:10-1:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:15:10):**  out.  
**[1:15:11-1:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:15:11):**  This is a really cool project I want to keep tabs on.  
**[1:15:13-1:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:15:13):**  So yeah, Kristin, thank you so much for making time for us today.  
**[1:15:17-1:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:15:17):**  It was a real pleasure and thanks again to Atulia for putting us in touch.  
**[1:15:22-1:15:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:15:22):**  It's been wonderful getting to know what you're doing down there.  
**[1:15:24-1:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:15:24):**  And man, I really miss that region of the world, though I'm having a great time in Spain  
**[1:15:28-1:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:15:28):**  too.  
**[1:15:29-1:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:15:29):**  I have to get back over there sometime, especially Ecuador.  
**[1:15:33-1:15:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:15:33):**  It's been like a year since I've been there.  
**[1:15:35-1:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:15:35):**  That place is gorgeous.  
**[1:15:36-1:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:15:36):**  Yeah, actually.  
**[1:15:37-1:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:15:37):**  Yeah.  
**[1:15:38-1:15:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:15:38):**  Let's stay in touch because maybe you can, you know, come help me teach a workshop or  
**[1:15:42-1:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:15:42):**  something.  
**[1:15:43-1:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:15:43):**  Oh, that'd be super fun.  
**[1:15:44-1:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:15:44):**  Likewise over here when I get established.  
**[1:15:46-1:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:15:46):**  Yeah.  
**[1:15:47-1:15:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:15:47):**  Yeah.  
**[1:15:48-1:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:15:48):**  Cool.  
**[1:15:49-1:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:15:49):**  Again, thanks so much for taking the time and we'll talk again soon.  
**[1:15:52-1:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:15:52):**  Okay, great.  
**[1:15:54-1:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:15:54):**  Ciao.  
**[1:15:55-1:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:15:55):**  Bye.  
**[1:15:56-1:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:15:56):**  All right, that wraps things up for this week's episode.  
**[1:15:59-1:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:15:59):**  If you enjoyed this interview and want to find more like it, as well as articles and

**[1:16:09-1:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:16:09):**  The best part is that you can search by topic rather than wading through more than 100 interviews  
**[1:16:13-1:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:16:13):**  by typing in any keyword or topic that you're looking for in the search function on the  
**[1:16:17-1:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:16:17):**  podcast page.  
**[1:16:19-1:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:16:19):**  I've spoken to experts on everything from growing your own food, building homes from  
**[1:16:22-1:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:16:22):**  natural materials, to beekeeping, vermicompost, permaculture design philosophy, and so much  
**[1:16:28-1:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:16:28):**  more.  
**[1:16:30-1:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:16:30):**  Thank you so much to those of you who've taken the time to reach out via comments and emails.  
**[1:16:34-1:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:16:34):**  Your contributions helped me to make this the conversation that it's intended to be  
**[1:16:38-1:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:16:38):**  and helps me create more of the content around the topics that you're interested in.  
**[1:16:42-1:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:16:42):**  If you have any insights, advice, questions, or suggestions, be sure to send them to me  
**[1:16:46-1:16:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:16:46):**  at info at abundantedge.com and I'll look forward to being in touch.  
**[1:16:51-1:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kristen-krash/#t=1:16:51):**  New episodes come out every Friday like clockwork, so I'll catch you on next week's show.

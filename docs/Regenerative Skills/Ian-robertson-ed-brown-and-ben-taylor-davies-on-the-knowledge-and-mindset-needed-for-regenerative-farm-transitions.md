**[0:00:48-0:00:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:00:48):**  Or do they take a gamble on new management methods that prioritize soil biology and multiple

**[0:00:59-0:01:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:00:59):**  for most growers who have relied on these inputs for years, if not decades, there will

**[0:01:12-0:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:01:12):**  out there with a track record of guiding farmers through the challenge of transitioning their

**[0:01:21-0:01:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:01:21):**  discussion. So in today's episode, I'll be speaking with Ian Robertson, Ben Taylor-Davies,  
**[0:01:27-0:01:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:01:27):**  and Ed Brown. Between these three fellas, they have decades of experience at the forefront  
**[0:01:32-0:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:01:32):**  of regenerative agriculture, and they continue to push the advancement of agroecological  
**[0:01:37-0:01:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:01:37):**  innovation at both the individual farm scale as well as the institutional level. All three  
**[0:01:43-0:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:01:43):**  of these guys are good friends who attest to speaking to one another just about every  
**[0:01:47-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:01:47):**  day, and you'll hear the characteristics of their friendship come out in this insightful  
**[0:01:52-0:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:01:52):**  and also light-hearted discussion. But I'll let them give their own introductions, and  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:01:56):**  so now I'll hand things over to Ben, Ian, and Ed.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:02:01):**  I'll start this off, gentlemen, by going around and let's get some introductions from everyone  
**[0:02:06-0:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:02:06):**  so that we can get the right voice to the right name. Starting with Ian, would you like  
**[0:02:12-0:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:02:12):**  to go first?  
**[0:02:13-0:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:02:13):**  Oh yeah, I'm Ian Robertson. I run a business called Sustainable Soil Management, which  
**[0:02:20-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:02:20):**  is looking at the soils in a lot more detail. I've been involved in soils since year 2000,  
**[0:02:29-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:02:29):**  and we've always, my background has been, grew up on an organic farm, so we've always  
**[0:02:36-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:02:36):**  been focused on soils, was very much involved in organic agriculture. However, the development  
**[0:02:43-0:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:02:43):**  over the last number of years has been about linking the best chemistry, the best technology,  
**[0:02:48-0:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:02:48):**  the best chemistry out there with standard organic practices. That all starts with soil,  
**[0:02:54-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:02:54):**  so we're spending a lot of time understanding soils' physical and chemical attributes, which  
**[0:02:58-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:02:58):**  then turn into biology. And we're doing more and more biological testing, right, because  
**[0:03:02-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:03:02):**  it's a lot more readily available at a sensible price for farmers to use, where before it  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:03:08):**  was always a kind of research tool in the biological area. Yes, that's what I've been  
**[0:03:13-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:03:13):**  doing for the last 20 years.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:03:16):**  Brilliant, thank you Ian. Ed, can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your work?  
**[0:03:21-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:03:21):**  Yeah, so I qualified as an agronomist eight years ago. I've spent the first two, three  
**[0:03:30-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:03:30):**  years learning the ropes as a traditional agronomist with answers in a can and a bag,  
**[0:03:39-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:03:39):**  and then became interested in soil health, mainly off the back of beginning to see more  
**[0:03:45-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:03:45):**  issues on my clients' farms around soils and how they were managed and problems that  
**[0:03:51-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:03:51):**  that then caused from an agronomic perspective. And from soil health then very much fell down  
**[0:03:57-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:03:57):**  the rabbit hole of regenerative agriculture, which is when I started speaking a lot with  
**[0:04:02-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:04:02):**  Ben and Ian. And then, yeah, really I've built up a sort of client base and a reputation  
**[0:04:09-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:04:09):**  based around that. And I spend my time practically implementing regenerative agriculture for  
**[0:04:17-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:04:17):**  farmers in the UK. I'm now head of agroecology for Hutchinson's, the company I work for. So  
**[0:04:24-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:04:24):**  that will basically be providing support to other agronomists, helping their clients navigate,  
**[0:04:31-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:04:31):**  you know, sort of new ways of doing things and also putting together a training programme  
**[0:04:35-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:04:35):**  for agronomists so that they can deliver what I do on farm as well.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:04:39):**  Wonderful. Thank you, Ed. And Ben, for those who haven't heard you on this show before,  
**[0:04:43-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:04:43):**  can you give them a little of your background?  
**[0:04:45-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:04:45):**  Yeah, so I'm very similar intro to Ed's actually. Trained as a, unfortunately I didn't see the  
**[0:04:53-0:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:04:53):**  light quite as quick as Ed did. So I was probably about 15 years into an agronomist, high input  
**[0:04:59-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:04:59):**  agronomy until I actually realised that perhaps we were shovelling water uphill with a pitchfork.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:05:07):**  And yeah, I'm also a farmer that tries to implement what I preach. So I practice what  
**[0:05:12-0:05:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:05:12):**  I preach and preach what I practice. And interesting enough, the reason that the three of us are  
**[0:05:18-0:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:05:18):**  here is probably we speak almost daily. We just happen to have this most wonderful rapport  
**[0:05:25-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:05:25):**  of bouncing ideas around. There is one thing I think in regenerative agriculture you need  
**[0:05:31-0:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:05:31):**  is a sounding board to talk to people, to bounce ideas off. And when you happen to have  
**[0:05:37-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:05:37):**  the right couple of people that you can bounce the ideas around, bring up and say, do you  
**[0:05:42-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:05:42):**  think I'm being absolutely stupid? Or do you think I'm absolutely onto something here?  
**[0:05:46-0:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:05:46):**  It's always handy to have a couple of people and Ian and Ed are people I speak to pretty  
**[0:05:52-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:05:52):**  much daily to just bounce these things around. And I think you end up also egging each other  
**[0:05:58-0:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:05:58):**  on a little bit to push and drive and that also helps. And yeah, so from my point of  
**[0:06:05-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:06:05):**  view, I'm a farmer, regen, agronomist, trading is regen then as most would know. And yeah,  
**[0:06:15-0:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:06:15):**  living the life.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:06:16):**  Fantastic. And it's that dynamic, it's that rapport and that exchange the three of you  
**[0:06:22-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:06:22):**  have that I'm hoping to get a window into here and share with the audience. But I want  
**[0:06:27-0:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:06:27):**  to start from the beginning with a statement that I hope will get us past some of the preliminary  
**[0:06:32-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:06:32):**  talks that would otherwise have us defining some basics. So let's begin with a general  
**[0:06:37-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:06:37):**  statement and then we can build on this throughout the discussion. And that would be that biologically  
**[0:06:44-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:06:44):**  dynamic healthy soil is one of, if not the key element in a profitable and regenerative  
**[0:06:50-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:06:50):**  farming enterprise to understand and manage effectively. Would we all agree on that so  
**[0:06:55-0:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:06:55):**  far? Yeah, it's a good place to start. All right. Well, with that said, then let's go  
**[0:07:00-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:07:00):**  into the first question, which is what are the most common reasons that farmers come  
**[0:07:05-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:07:05):**  to each of you for help? Or perhaps what are the most common predicaments that the growers  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:07:10):**  that you encounter are in? Ed, would you like to start us off?  
**[0:07:15-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:07:15):**  No pressure. Probably not the answer you wanted, but there are so there's always a different  
**[0:07:23-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:07:23):**  reason because farms and farmers are so specific to their, their land, their system, their

**[0:22:43-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:22:43):**  things that growers should look for to understand before needing to get advanced degrees or

**[0:23:10-0:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:23:10):**  testing. So I think it's important not to look at anything in isolation. So some people  
**[0:23:19-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:23:19):**  within this sphere would say, oh, everybody needs a spade to go out and dig holes. That's  
**[0:23:25-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:23:25):**  brilliant and is really, really important. I think every farmer should be armed with  
**[0:23:28-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:23:28):**  a spade and be digging holes on their farm on a regular basis. But it doesn't necessarily

**[0:23:43-0:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:23:43):**  to tell you why you've got that issue. So start off by digging holes, assessing soils.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:23:50):**  Farmers seem to quite enjoy engaging with counting worms, which is great. Have you got

**[0:24:01-0:24:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:24:01):**  structure are two really, really simple things. I think then it's important you can get bogged

**[0:24:15-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:24:15):**  for us the most kind of affordable, practical in order to complete, but actually what gives  
**[0:24:24-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:24:24):**  you not too much data, but data that you can use. So I think it's about picking a soil  
**[0:24:29-0:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:24:29):**  test that goes beyond just the basics of index, you know, looking at all of the nutrients  
**[0:24:38-0:24:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:24:38):**  because they're all important. Something that includes organic matter, perhaps explores  
**[0:24:43-0:24:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:24:43):**  organic matter in a bit more depth. And then I guess the last thing to add on would be  
**[0:24:48-0:24:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:24:48):**  some form of biological measure. And there are more of these coming to the market now.  
**[0:24:53-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:24:53):**  So we've looked at a few of them. So trying to get a grasp on biological activity in the  
**[0:25:00-0:25:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:25:00):**  soil as well. So I haven't got into specifics there because there's lots of stuff available.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:25:05):**  And obviously we use what we use. There are others out there. None of them are as good,  
**[0:25:12-0:25:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:25:12):**  but I think it's really about putting all the different elements of soil together, not  
**[0:25:19-0:25:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:25:19):**  just focusing on one different thing. It's the biology, it's the chemistry, it's the

**[0:25:27-0:25:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:25:27):**  I'd like to just add to that if that's okay. One of the most important things for me is  
**[0:25:33-0:25:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:25:33):**  all of a sudden understanding that most tests for soil are there to measure the availability  
**[0:25:41-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:25:41):**  of an element to feed a plant. That is a very, very different thing than what have I got

**[0:26:00-0:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ian-robertson-ed-brown-and-ben-taylor-davies-on-the-knowledge-and-mindset-needed-for-regenerative-farm-transitions/#t=0:26:00):**  the total level of calcium, the total level of potassium drove the way my soul actually

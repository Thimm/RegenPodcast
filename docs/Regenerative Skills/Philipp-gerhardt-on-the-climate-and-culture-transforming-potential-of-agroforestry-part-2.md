**[0:07:17-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:07:17):**  So the interception of rainwater in winter is less.

**[0:37:51-0:37:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:37:51):**  stuff and regional vegetables into the market.

**[0:38:16-0:38:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:38:16):**  So I mean, that's pretty vast.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:38:18):**  You can be in Eastern Brandenburg and get a regional cucumber from the border to the

**[0:38:25-0:38:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:38:25):**  And yeah, you need to really educate the consumers to look behind these fancy words.  
**[0:38:34-0:38:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:38:34):**  And it's the same, for example, with honey.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:38:36):**  And okay, people actually understood that it's not really good to have honey from Africa  
**[0:38:42-0:38:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:38:42):**  or Mexico.

**[0:38:49-0:38:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:38:49):**  Europe.

**[0:39:13-0:39:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:39:13):**  The same maybe with forestry.  
**[0:39:16-0:39:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:39:16):**  If you sell on a small scale special forest products like charcoal for grilling, I know  
**[0:39:25-0:39:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:39:25):**  that there's a kind of a market in Great Britain.  
**[0:39:30-0:39:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:39:30):**  The Forestry Commission has managed to get a lot of people to buy small forests again,

**[0:39:50-0:39:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:39:50):**  We're still focusing on getting all these small scale forest owners into producing big  
**[0:39:56-0:39:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:39:56):**  trees from the timber industry.  
**[0:39:58-0:40:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:39:58):**  That means in a small scale forest, every second generation can sell two or three trees  
**[0:40:04-0:40:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:40:04):**  to the industry.

**[0:40:15-0:40:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:40:15):**  a trailer or a tiny house in your forest and make a fireplace and spend your leisure time  
**[0:40:20-0:40:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:40:20):**  there, produce honey, harvest some bast and do some what's called basketry and maybe do  
**[0:40:34-0:40:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:40:34):**  some coppicing on like willow coppicing and do basketry or I don't know, make maple syrup  
**[0:40:45-0:40:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:40:45):**  or whatever, or harvest lime tree leaves and make flour out of them.  
**[0:40:52-0:40:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:40:52):**  I don't know.  
**[0:40:53-0:41:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:40:53):**  There's so many products from the forest that we haven't even looked at for 500 years.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:41:00):**  And they're actually very, very valuable.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:41:07):**  So that means you can have a business opportunity from forest as well.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:41:13):**  Or another thing would be if you have a forest, then you could plant fruiting varieties of  
**[0:41:20-0:41:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:41:20):**  chestnuts in the forest, for example, and collect them and sell them.  
**[0:41:25-0:41:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:41:25):**  There are some legal issues with that, but I know there are ways to be grounded.  
**[0:41:32-0:41:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:41:32):**  And it also depends on which country you are in, Europe, for example.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:41:37):**  Then other business opportunities.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:41:40):**  Of course, we need a lot of planning and advising to create this agroforestry landscape now and  
**[0:41:50-0:41:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:41:50):**  to do the forest restoration.

**[0:42:01-0:42:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:42:01):**  But I think it's not endless.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:42:06):**  There are a lot of people who want to advise in agroforestry now.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:42:11):**  There's a lot of young people.

**[0:42:21-0:42:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:42:21):**  And it's something where we deal with really big capital, with big forces, and there's  
**[0:42:28-0:42:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:42:28):**  a lot of risk in it.

**[0:42:34-0:42:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:42:34):**  Look at the responsibility you have.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:42:40):**  If you're planting trees and if you're reshaping the landscape and creating different patterns  
**[0:42:45-0:42:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:42:45):**  and you're making a farmer spend hundreds of hundreds of thousands of euros, that's  
**[0:42:52-0:42:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:42:52):**  a great responsibility.

**[0:43:01-0:43:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:43:01):**  Well in forestry, we have planning bureaus as well and freelance foresters that do all  
**[0:43:09-0:43:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:43:09):**  this stuff.  
**[0:43:10-0:43:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:43:10):**  They just need to reeducate themselves to incorporate these newer silviculture measures.

**[0:44:12-0:44:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:44:12):**  I'm doing it in my company.  
**[0:44:14-0:44:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:44:14):**  I have a lot of trainees and they're starting to do planning.  
**[0:44:18-0:44:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:44:18):**  And really, it's amazing how you can actually create a plan and a design for agroforestry  
**[0:44:29-0:44:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:44:29):**  that really looks nice.  
**[0:44:30-0:44:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:44:30):**  But from the expert point of view, I would say, wow, that's completely wrong.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:44:35):**  Like do it differently.  
**[0:44:37-0:44:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:44:37):**  So not every shiny map and plan of an agroforestry that looks nice will actually work.  
**[0:44:47-0:44:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:44:47):**  And so I think that's what we need to build up.  
**[0:44:49-0:44:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:44:49):**  We need to build up a few companies where young people can get into and learn on the

**[0:45:05-0:45:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:45:05):**  you will sell people your experiments.  
**[0:45:08-0:45:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:45:08):**  And that's something that I never did.  
**[0:45:10-0:45:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:45:10):**  I started to do agroforestry planning seven years ago and for the first four to five years,  
**[0:45:19-0:45:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:45:19):**  I didn't take any money.  
**[0:45:20-0:45:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:45:20):**  I just financed it by working on other projects.  
**[0:45:26-0:45:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:45:26):**  I did some nature conservation work.  
**[0:45:32-0:45:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:45:32):**  I was employed somewhere and earned my money there.  
**[0:45:35-0:45:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:45:35):**  And I did my agroforestry planning for free because I said, hey, we're learning together.  
**[0:45:42-0:45:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:45:42):**  I can't sell you my experiments.  
**[0:45:45-0:45:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:45:45):**  And that's a thing that I think is very important.  
**[0:45:49-0:45:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:45:49):**  It's the mindset of young planners to actually tell people, hey, it's a completely new business.  
**[0:45:59-0:46:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:45:59):**  And we can do educated guesses because we know something from forestry.  
**[0:46:05-0:46:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:46:05):**  We know how trees grow.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:46:06):**  We know something from fruit production.

**[0:46:18-0:46:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:46:18):**  structure.  
**[0:46:19-0:46:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:46:19):**  And so we're experimenting together.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:46:23):**  And only, yeah, well still, just be aware what you're selling to the people.  
**[0:46:32-0:46:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:46:32):**  And of course, you need to earn money, but you need to be very responsible.  
**[0:46:38-0:46:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:46:38):**  And then it's a business opportunity to do planning and advising as well.  
**[0:46:47-0:46:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:46:47):**  That's really good advice, especially because of how much of a lag time is involved with  
**[0:46:52-0:46:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:46:52):**  putting in long-term perennial systems.  
**[0:46:55-0:47:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:46:55):**  And you're not probably going to see how well they take for 10, 20 years in many cases,  
**[0:47:03-0:47:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:47:03):**  even more.

**[0:47:08-0:47:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:47:08):**  of time, you're right.  
**[0:47:11-0:47:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:47:11):**  Creating solid experience before having the confidence to go out there and charge good  
**[0:47:17-0:47:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:47:17):**  money for that type of design is crucial.  
**[0:47:21-0:47:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:47:21):**  And hopefully, there are more and more people out there with that experience that you can  
**[0:47:27-0:47:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:47:27):**  work with or find some sort of mentorship or coaching agreement with.

**[0:47:34-0:47:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:47:34):**  on with climate farmers.

**[0:47:39-0:47:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:47:39):**  It's going to take a while for an experienced workforce to be able to make this kind of  
**[0:47:46-0:47:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:47:46):**  stuff available, especially at competitive prices for people.

**[0:47:55-0:47:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:47:55):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:56-0:47:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:47:56):**  Yeah.

**[0:48:03-0:48:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:48:03):**  How do you become an experienced planner or advisor?  
**[0:48:06-0:48:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:48:06):**  You need to mess around with the stuff and make your experiences.  
**[0:48:10-0:48:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:48:10):**  And for example, especially in key lime design, it's really dangerous to mess around with  
**[0:48:17-0:48:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:48:17):**  huge quantities of water.  
**[0:48:19-0:48:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:48:19):**  And I've been messing around with huge quantities of water for a while, but I made it clear  
**[0:48:26-0:48:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:48:26):**  to the people with whom I work that we're messing around with this together.  
**[0:48:31-0:48:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:48:31):**  I did my first key lime design saying, hey, this is completely new, it's an experiment.  
**[0:48:37-0:48:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:48:37):**  And we had dams broken.  
**[0:48:39-0:48:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:48:39):**  We had the Grand Canyon on a field.  
**[0:48:43-0:48:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:48:43):**  But we knew that could happen.

**[0:48:52-0:49:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:48:52):**  But had I sold the system, had I planned the system to somebody, it would have been a disaster,  
**[0:49:01-0:49:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:49:01):**  I think.

**[0:49:08-0:49:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:49:08):**  don't do it.  
**[0:49:11-0:49:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:49:11):**  It will lead to a breaking dam.  
**[0:49:15-0:49:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:49:15):**  But it was a great experience.  
**[0:49:18-0:49:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:49:18):**  And we repaired the damage.  
**[0:49:21-0:49:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:49:21):**  But it's important to have these experiences.

**[0:49:37-0:49:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:49:37):**  advisory planning companies who have a workforce where you can get into, where you can learn

**[0:49:47-0:49:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:49:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:49:48-0:49:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:49:48):**  Yeah.  
**[0:49:49-0:49:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:49:49):**  Hopefully that becomes increasingly available, especially with the demand for these types  
**[0:49:51-0:49:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:49:51):**  of services and just how essential they are in a changing ecology.  
**[0:49:56-0:50:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:49:56):**  Now I want to wrap up this conversation with kind of a fun question.  
**[0:50:00-0:50:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:50:00):**  So if you were in charge of, let's say, a national forestry management department for  
**[0:50:06-0:50:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:50:06):**  a whole country, let's say Germany, or even at a grander scale, like for Europe, what  
**[0:50:11-0:50:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:50:11):**  policies or initiatives would you enact in order to turn the degraded trajectory of forest  
**[0:50:17-0:50:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:50:17):**  lands around and start to regenerate things?  
**[0:50:21-0:50:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:50:21):**  I would apply massive thinnings in younger coniferous plantations saying, hey, like I  
**[0:50:33-0:50:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:50:33):**  mean on the state level, I would put in money, like state money.  
**[0:50:38-0:50:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:50:38):**  I mean, we've just signed this bill putting 100 billion euros into the army.  
**[0:50:46-0:50:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:50:46):**  So there is money and we're doing all sorts of stuff.  
**[0:50:52-0:51:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:50:52):**  And I think it would be, and forestry is relatively cheap compared to buying new military equipment,  
**[0:51:02-0:51:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:51:02):**  for example.  
**[0:51:03-0:51:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:51:03):**  So I would, I don't know, pour in 1 billion euros or something to say, hey, let's just  
**[0:51:09-0:51:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:51:09):**  go in the forests and do massive thinning and replanting.  
**[0:51:15-0:51:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:51:15):**  For example, pine plantations, which are said to be not harvestable yet, but that means  
**[0:51:24-0:51:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:51:24):**  they're not harvestable yet from an economic perspective.  
**[0:51:28-0:51:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/philipp-gerhardt-on-the-climate-and-culture-transforming-potential-of-agroforestry-part-2/#t=0:51:28):**  That's just if you say, yeah, the dimension is too little to get the maximum price out

**[0:01:09-0:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:01:09):**  Hey there everybody, welcome back.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:01:14):**  With regenerative agriculture and agroforestry increasingly becoming popular topics in environmental  
**[0:01:19-0:01:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:01:19):**  and even political circles, I wanted to do a one-on-one session with one of my favorite  
**[0:01:24-0:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:01:24):**  speakers in this sphere, Patrick Worms.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:01:26):**  Now many of you frequent listeners will remember him from the panel discussion on agroforestry  
**[0:01:31-0:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:01:31):**  two weeks ago that I hosted with climate farmers.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:01:34):**  I got to know Patrick's work and perspective more intimately as part of the online course  
**[0:01:39-0:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:01:39):**  on ecosystem restoration design that we both teach on.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:01:44):**  Patrick is the Senior Science Policy Advisor at World Agroforestry, President of the European  
**[0:01:49-0:01:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:01:49):**  Agroforestry Federation, and Trustee on the International Union of Agroforestry.  
**[0:01:54-0:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:01:54):**  He's also a valued member of the Advisory Council with the Ecosystem Restoration Camps.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:02:00):**  Now in the courses and conversations that I've seen with him, I've always been struck  
**[0:02:04-0:02:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:02:04):**  by the stories and compassionate understanding of the people that Patrick has met in his  
**[0:02:08-0:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:02:08):**  work and his travels.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:02:10):**  In order to make some of these stories and insights available to you listeners, I let  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:02:14):**  go of the usual focus on just actionable information to let this chat take its own course.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:02:19):**  Though we still cover a lot of practical advice in this talk, what I often take away from  
**[0:02:23-0:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:02:23):**  listening to Patrick is a renewed reverence for the individual people who are working  
**[0:02:27-0:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:02:27):**  to manage their lands and produce food all around the world.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:02:31):**  It's easy to think of agriculture and the food industry as these monoliths without faces,  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:02:36):**  but the lives of the people who make up these systems, from those who tend the land all  
**[0:02:41-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:02:41):**  the way through the logistics, distribution, transportation, and all the way to our kitchens,  
**[0:02:46-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:02:46):**  are important to remember and pay attention to as well.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:02:49):**  To get us started off with some background though, Patrick sheds some light on the history  
**[0:02:53-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:02:53):**  of agroforestry and its deep traditions in Europe specifically.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:02:57):**  You know when you're in a spaceship and it's a long way away and you take a picture back  
**[0:03:02-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:03:02):**  of Earth and you see this little blue marble next to the sun?  
**[0:03:06-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:03:06):**  That's the scale at which agroforestry can happen, right?  
**[0:03:10-0:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:03:10):**  We have examples of agroforestry from the Arctic region right next to the tundra.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:03:18):**  It's reindeer herding, it's a classical silver pastoral system, it's been going for centuries,  
**[0:03:22-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:03:22):**  and it's working well.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:03:25):**  Archaeology is now showing us examples of agroforestry systems that were maintaining  
**[0:03:27-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:03:27):**  extremely high population densities in places as different as the Southwestern Amazon or  
**[0:03:33-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:03:33):**  the Papuan Highlands and that were doing so anywhere between 5 and 12,000 years ago.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:03:41):**  The old story we all heard at school that agriculture started 7,000 years ago when people  
**[0:03:45-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:03:45):**  domesticated some grasses in the Middle East and then spread around the world.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:03:49):**  It's just a tiny part of what history and the history of agriculture actually reveals.  
**[0:03:56-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:03:56):**  Thousands of plants and animals were domesticated around the world in hundreds of different  
**[0:03:59-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:03:59):**  locations over timescales that took millennia and started about 12,000 years ago.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:04:05):**  So it's an absolutely extraordinary story and the reason we're only just beginning to  
**[0:04:09-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:04:09):**  discover it is because not every civilization had the good idea of building a great big  
**[0:04:14-0:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:04:14):**  fat pyramid there so that we knew that something happened.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:04:18):**  Most of these things were disappeared in the landscape.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:04:21):**  Think of the Amazon for example, there's no stone there, there's only wood.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:04:25):**  So even if you build a massive structure out of wood 5,000 years ago, the likelihood that  
**[0:04:29-0:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:04:29):**  anything would be left 5,000 years down the road for an archaeologist to find its nail.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:04:34):**  So it took the more sophisticated technologies we have today to begin to discover that.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:04:38):**  Now let's zoom back from this deep history to today and from this whole globe to Europe.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:04:45):**  Agroforestry was a traditional farming practice across Europe as well, especially before the  
**[0:04:51-0:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:04:51):**  19th century, i.e. before we started having external inputs and mechanization.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:04:56):**  It was simply the way things were done, in particular for grazing systems.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:05:00):**  The idea that a grazing system is a pasture that is empty of trees and shrubs is a modern  
**[0:05:05-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:05:05):**  one.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:05:06):**  Traditional grazing systems around the world tended to include trees and shrubs all the  
**[0:05:09-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:05:09):**  time, not only because of the ecosystem services that these trees and shrubs provide to the  
**[0:05:14-0:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:05:14):**  grasses, but also because they themselves provide nutrition and micronutrients to your  
**[0:05:19-0:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:05:19):**  livestock in ways that the grasses don't always do.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:05:22):**  And it's not that people were using words like micronutrients to describe why they had  
**[0:05:29-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:05:29):**  these trees or their shrubs in their fields, of course.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:05:32):**  Those are modern words we use to describe the mechanics of the science underpinning  
**[0:05:36-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:05:36):**  these management practices.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:05:38):**  But these management practices evolved through trial and error over time, and were extremely  
**[0:05:42-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:05:42):**  successful.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:05:44):**  By extremely successful, I mean they fed our cities during the Industrial Revolution.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:05:49):**  They fed our armies, which proceeded to colonize the world.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:05:53):**  They were successful agricultural systems.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:05:56):**  The result of that productivity was not always used for good things.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:06:02):**  You know, I'm only thinking of Nazism or Fascism or Communism or Stalinism or colonialism here.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:06:10):**  But it was fueled by this agricultural productivity.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:06:16):**  And today, again, we find that agroforestry is coming back to the fore.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:06:21):**  And the reason for that is because we're beginning to realize the limitations of the wonderful  
**[0:06:27-0:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:06:27):**  suite of modern agricultural technologies we started deploying at scale after the First  
**[0:06:32-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:06:32):**  World War.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:06:33):**  Fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, irrigation, tractors, pumps, other forms of machinery,  
**[0:06:41-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:06:41):**  all those things very rapidly made the life of farmers a lot easier.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:06:46):**  But the limits are becoming obvious to all.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:06:48):**  And that's why we're having this conversation.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:06:50):**  And it turns out that you can replace a lot of these things simply by managing your landscape  
**[0:06:53-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:06:53):**  a little bit differently.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:06:54):**  And the first thing you can do in order to manage that landscape differently is to begin  
**[0:06:59-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:06:59):**  to add trees back into a landscape where the trees have been taken out.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:07:04):**  So there's a lot of criticism and perhaps analysis of trees being integrated back into  
**[0:07:10-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:07:10):**  annual based agricultural systems and saying that it'll take away from the amount of land  
**[0:07:16-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:07:16):**  able to be productive.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:07:19):**  And it could get in the way of the efficiency of the systems that use large machinery and  
**[0:07:23-0:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:07:23):**  chemical inputs in order to dominate an entire ecosystem for a single crop, perhaps.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:07:31):**  But we both know that it's not necessary to farm that way.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:07:35):**  And in fact, it's a very small percent of farming that is run that way, which actually  
**[0:07:40-0:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:07:40):**  contributes to the global food supply.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:07:43):**  Well, there is that.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:07:44):**  But I'd like to get back to the way you phrased this question.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:07:48):**  There's less land available for crops.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:07:51):**  It is less efficient.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:07:52):**  By using these words, you've already decided that the only way to farm is in large monocrops.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:07:59):**  Any farmer that thinks along these ways is a farmer that will eventually go bankrupt.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:08:06):**  Because the thing that matters to a farmer is not the efficiency of production.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:08:11):**  And it's not the yield.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:08:12):**  And it's not the amount of land that is under a particular crop.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:08:15):**  The thing that matters to a farmer is how much money is in the bank after he's paid  
**[0:08:19-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:08:19):**  all his costs and sold all his products.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:08:23):**  And it turns out that time and time again, this resource intensive industrial farming  
**[0:08:31-0:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:08:31):**  systems that have become prevalent across Europe are not very profitable.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:08:36):**  They only work at very large scales, which is why family farms are disappearing, which  
**[0:08:40-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:08:40):**  is why small farms are disappearing.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:08:42):**  And because they only work at very large scales, they are destroying local communities, because  
**[0:08:48-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:08:48):**  they are efficient enough so that you need one unit of labor in some of the most productive  
**[0:08:52-0:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:08:52):**  areas of Europe per 250 hectares of land.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:08:56):**  That means that the population density across the landscape is so low that there are no  
**[0:09:00-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:09:00):**  villages anymore.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:09:01):**  There are no shops, there are no churches, there are no schools, there are no cafes,  
**[0:09:05-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:09:05):**  there is nothing.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:09:06):**  Which means that no young person wants to farm there, which means that as the old farmers  
**[0:09:10-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:09:10):**  die out, the land is taken over by people who are doing corporate farming.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:09:14):**  And corporate farmers, they don't care about the social network.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:09:17):**  All they care about is reducing their costs and employing cheap labor and replacing that  
**[0:09:23-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:09:23):**  cheap labor, because it's still more expensive than machinery, with machinery and inputs  
**[0:09:26-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:09:26):**  wherever they can.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:09:28):**  So at very large scale, it works.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:09:29):**  You can make money in that way.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:09:30):**  But at any scale but the very large one, you cannot.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:09:33):**  However, if you focus on profit, if you focus on reducing your costs, if you focus on the  
**[0:09:39-0:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:09:39):**  difference between what you pay and what you get, then it is extremely possible to be a  
**[0:09:45-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:09:45):**  family farmer on 10 or 20 or 30 or 100 or 150 hectares and still make a decent living.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:09:52):**  So don't focus on the yield, don't focus on the efficiency, don't focus on the amount  
**[0:09:56-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:09:56):**  of land under your monocrop, focus on how much money you're making.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:00):**  And once you focus on how much money you're making, you'll start tinkering with the system,  
**[0:10:04-0:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:04):**  because you realize that diesel is bloody expensive.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:07):**  So why do you want to plow that deep soil every year, right?  
**[0:10:11-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:11):**  You will realize that herbicides are expensive, pesticides are expensive, fertilizer is expensive,  
**[0:10:15-0:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:15):**  irrigation is expensive.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:16):**  Everything is a cost.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:18):**  And you'll try to cut down on some of them.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:20):**  Because some of these services will be replaced by trees.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:23):**  Some of these services will be replaced by no till.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:25):**  Some of these services will be replaced by cover crops.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:27):**  Some of these services will be replaced by other kinds of trees.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:30):**  Some of these services will be replaced by direct seeding into a cover crop, etc, etc,  
**[0:10:35-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:35):**  etc.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:36):**  And you start experimenting.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:37):**  And as you start experimenting, some things will work and some things will not work.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:39):**  but you'll keep the things that work and your profitability is just going to go up year  
**[0:10:45-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:45):**  after year after year after year.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:47):**  And eventually you're just not going to have to go to the bank any longer except to check  
**[0:10:53-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:53):**  how much money you've got.  
**[0:10:55-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:55):**  You certainly don't need to ever again have that really difficult conversation about borrowing  
**[0:11:00-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:00):**  yet more money to try to keep a failing business afloat.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:04):**  Can you explain that a little further about how farmers have been incentivized to manage  
**[0:11:08-0:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:08):**  their production systems in a way that is not congruent with their own profitability?  
**[0:11:14-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:14):**  The objective has always got to be the fundamental objective.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:17):**  Farm is a business.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:18):**  The fundamental objective of any farm has got to be to make a profit.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:22):**  And if your goal is not to increase your profit margin, then you've got the wrong goal.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:27):**  And in farming, industry has convinced farmers that the only goal that matters is yield and  
**[0:11:32-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:32):**  efficiency.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:33):**  That's great for industry, but it's disaster for farmers.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:37):**  I see that everywhere.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:38):**  I have a friend in Belgium.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:40):**  I'm in Belgium.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:41):**  I have a friend in the Belgian Ardennes who is doing regenerative grazing.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:44):**  And he started 10 years ago with 6,000 euros in his pocket.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:47):**  He's now the most profitable beef grower in his region.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:51):**  All around, people are intensively growing this monstrosity called the Blain Bleu Belgé.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:58):**  It's a breed whose muscles are so hypertrophied that it cannot give birth naturally anymore.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:12:05):**  And the cows need to be born by cesarean section.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:12:09):**  And at the bar on a Friday evening, what the farmers are talking about is how they managed  
**[0:12:14-0:12:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:12:14):**  to put another three pounds onto the maximum carcass weight of their cow, of this particular  
**[0:12:22-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:12:22):**  cow.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:12:23):**  How they bred him to be a little bit heavier still.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:12:26):**  And they're drowning in debt because it's an extremely expensive, very, very input-demanding  
**[0:12:34-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:12:34):**  management system.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:12:35):**  Just imagine, your cows are so fragile.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:12:40):**  A cesarean section for every calf.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:12:45):**  It's madness.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:12:46):**  But they are convinced that this is the way of farming.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:12:48):**  And to begin with, my friend who was doing the regenerative grazing was actually attacked  
**[0:12:52-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:12:52):**  in the street, not physically, but shouted at in the street by people who said it was  
**[0:12:56-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:12:56):**  disgusting.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:12:57):**  He was putting trees back in his fields and their grandfathers had broken their backs  
**[0:13:01-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:01):**  to pull all these trees out.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:04):**  And there he was putting them back and damaging these fields again.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:08):**  That was 10 years ago.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:09):**  Now they come to ask him for advice.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:12):**  Tell me some other stories that you've got from the practitioners that you've worked  
**[0:13:15-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:15):**  with and you've helped to guide into systems that work for their context.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:20):**  Because it really is specific to where everybody is, what their personal goals on their land  
**[0:13:24-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:24):**  are.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:25):**  And you know this much better than I do, that there is no one-size-fits-all prescription  
**[0:13:30-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:30):**  for how agroforestry can work on a site.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:34):**  There is one.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:35):**  There is one prescription.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:38):**  Be a geek.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:40):**  The farmers who are geeks always make it.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:44):**  And sometimes the geeks have to hide themselves.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:47):**  I'm thinking back to this woman I met in the Ruwenzori Mountains.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:52):**  It's a mountain range that's in the humid tropic bits of Uganda and forms the boundary  
**[0:13:57-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:57):**  to the Democratic Republic of Congo.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:00):**  And there the farmers of the village who grow a lot of coffee had received three years previously  
**[0:14:09-0:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:09):**  better coffee stock, better banana stock, better cassava stock, so better genetics,  
**[0:14:15-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:15):**  and a little bit of agronomic advice.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:17):**  Get there three years later, I look around, and most of the coffee bushes are like this  
**[0:14:21-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:21):**  high and the leaves are a bit yellow and there's not many cherries on them.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:25):**  And the cassava is okay, but the bananas are not doing great either.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:27):**  And the people are obviously poor.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:29):**  And then I see over there a place that's full of trees.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:33):**  And I ask them, oh, is that the graveyard?  
**[0:14:36-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:36):**  Because in Africa, usually the only place that has lots of trees is the graveyard because  
**[0:14:40-0:14:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:40):**  that's the one place you don't go and cut the trees down in because people might get  
**[0:14:43-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:43):**  angry.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:45):**  The dead might get angry.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:48):**  So they said, no, no, that's a farm that belongs to this lady.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:50):**  So I walk over there and indeed it's a farm.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:53):**  I walk in there, so lots of shade trees and coffee trees.  
**[0:14:57-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:57):**  Boom!  
**[0:14:58-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:58):**  Three meters high.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:59):**  Overloaded with cherries.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:01):**  Same genetics planted at the same time.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:05):**  And the soil was black.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:06):**  There were chickens running around.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:08):**  There were lots of cover crops.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:09):**  There were lianas growing along the trees.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:11):**  There was a variety of different trees, including those coffees, those cassava and that banana,  
**[0:15:15-0:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:15):**  but a lot more than that.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:16):**  And then this lady comes to me and she's shy.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:20):**  She's looking down at the ground, but she's obviously not poor.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:23):**  She's dressed in new clothes and she's fat when everybody else there is kind of scrawny,  
**[0:15:29-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:29):**  and I start asking her a question.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:32):**  She's just shy.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:33):**  She looks down on the ground.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:34):**  It took a while to get the story out of her.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:36):**  You know why she was shy?  
**[0:15:39-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:39):**  Because she was ashamed.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:40):**  And you know why she was ashamed?  
**[0:15:41-0:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:41):**  Because she totally ignored what the agronomist said three years previously.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:45):**  She found the way her grandmother had taught her to farm.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:50):**  And so I start asking questions.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:53):**  Why is nobody else doing what she's doing?  
**[0:15:54-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:54):**  It's obviously working so well, right?  
**[0:15:56-0:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:56):**  And I hear, well, she's a sorceress.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:01):**  Or the story I heard is, well, she had the help of a white man.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:06):**  What's the story there?  
**[0:16:07-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:07):**  Well, it turned out that a few years previously, like five or six years previously, some hippie  
**[0:16:12-0:16:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:12):**  kid with a backpack came through the village and stayed with her.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:16):**  And apparently he was a permaculture geek.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:20):**  And he shared some of this permaculture knowledge with this woman who was already farming quite  
**[0:16:23-0:16:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:23):**  well.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:24):**  And this woman was obviously a geek, right?  
**[0:16:25-0:16:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:25):**  She picked it all up.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:26):**  She integrated it into her farm.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:27):**  And her farm was amazingly productive.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:30):**  But she was ashamed because she was not doing what the university-educated outsider had  
**[0:16:35-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:35):**  told her she should do.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:38):**  And what do you say to farmers who, I mean, I've gone and talked to certain people and  
**[0:16:43-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:43):**  even introduced the ideas of not tilling the soil and gotten responses like, well, this  
**[0:16:48-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:48):**  is how we've always done it.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:49):**  This is how my father or my grandfather does it.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:52):**  This is a part of our culture.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:53):**  And it's always been done this way.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:54):**  Why would I change that now?  
**[0:16:56-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:56):**  What do you say to that?  
**[0:16:58-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:58):**  Nothing.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:59):**  I sympathize.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:17:02):**  I sympathize because I have, that reminds me of the story of a friend of mine, Indiana.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:17:10):**  Two brothers, one stayed on the land, one went off to the city.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:17:14):**  The one who went off to the city made a little bit of money and learned about, you know,  
**[0:17:18-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:17:18):**  was always interested but learned about regenerative agriculture and decided to go back to the  
**[0:17:24-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:17:24):**  land and pick up his part of the inheritance that was managed by his own brother to do  
**[0:17:29-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:17:29):**  his own stuff on it.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:17:31):**  His brother, meanwhile, had stayed on that land and for 30 years had farmed that land  
**[0:17:35-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:17:35):**  using the best advice that agro-industry gave him.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:17:41):**  Ever bigger, ever more, more inputs, better seeds, better everything.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:17:47):**  The poor man was working 18-hour days, seven days a week with a day off for Christmas if  
**[0:17:52-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:17:52):**  he was lucky, and he was still drowning in debt.  
**[0:17:56-0:18:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:17:56):**  Then his brother comes back from the city, takes over half the land and does regenerative  
**[0:18:00-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:18:00):**  grazing.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:18:01):**  He's working maybe three, four hours a day and he has no debt and he's making money.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:18:07):**  You know that almost broke that family because the brother who stayed on the land, who was  
**[0:18:14-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:18:14):**  in his 50s by then, who had spent his entire life running around, in effect being exploited  
**[0:18:23-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:18:23):**  worse than a slave, suddenly had to realize that he had wasted his life, that he'd been  
**[0:18:29-0:18:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:18:29):**  sold a bill of goods, that everything he had done and believed in and worked so hard for,  
**[0:18:37-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:18:37):**  the only thing he could show for it was poisoned soil and a big mountain of debt.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:18:42):**  Just imagine what that does to your head.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:18:43):**  I mean, you are still a young man Oliver, but just imagine, I'm the age of that guy.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:18:48):**  Just imagine what it does to your head to realize that you have worked harder than anybody  
**[0:18:55-0:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:18:55):**  else you know to pour your life down the drain.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:18:58):**  It's so hard.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:19:00):**  That's why when somebody tells me that this is the way we've always done it and I intend,  
**[0:19:05-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:19:05):**  fine, continue.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:19:07):**  It's your life, it's your fault.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:19:08):**  You do it the way you want.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:19:10):**  You know, it has to be the next generation sometimes.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:19:13):**  It doesn't always have to be the existing farmers.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:19:15):**  And in Europe, of course, that's a problem because the average age of farmers is what,  
**[0:19:19-0:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:19:19):**  56 or 57 or whatever it is now, old.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:19:23):**  That's the average.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:19:24):**  Yeah, even higher in the States, I think it's getting up in the 60s.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:19:28):**  Right.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:19:29):**  Which means it's, of course, you're not going to change.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:19:31):**  You know, I mean, at my age, you don't learn foreign languages anymore, right?  
**[0:19:37-0:19:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:19:37):**  You are set in your ways and you've acquired a certain expertise and people who've done  
**[0:19:43-0:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:19:43):**  industrial farming for 30 years and are still in that business have not yet been pushed  
**[0:19:47-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:19:47):**  off the land.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:19:49):**  They have acquired a certain expertise on how to farm that way.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:19:54):**  You know, you and I know that that expertise is a voix sans-d'issou.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:19:59):**  You can't, you know, it doesn't lead anywhere and that eventually farming has to change  
**[0:20:03-0:20:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:20:03):**  and that their sons and daughters will have to do things differently.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:20:07):**  But if they don't want to change, I'm in no position to tell them that they have to.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:20:12):**  I want to take a minute to point out how important this reflection is.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:20:16):**  I myself work in restoration design and regenerative agriculture consulting, and I'm increasingly  
**[0:20:21-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:20:21):**  seeing things like YouTube videos, Netflix documentaries, and blog articles from peers  
**[0:20:26-0:20:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:20:26):**  and others involved in this type of work that are pressing a message that we need to transform  
**[0:20:30-0:20:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:20:30):**  the food and health system all the time, especially at the farming level.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:20:35):**  Like I mentioned in the beginning, it's a very popular subject right now, and while  
**[0:20:39-0:20:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:20:39):**  I of course advocate for more ecological production methods, and I agree with a lot of the change  
**[0:20:44-0:20:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:20:44):**  that is needed in these industries, I'm increasingly left with a feeling from some of those prominent  
**[0:20:49-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:20:49):**  voices that it's so simple to make a change that, if it weren't for negligence or for  
**[0:20:54-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:20:54):**  ignorance or even some bad actors in the field sometimes, that we'd be able to turn this  
**[0:21:00-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:21:00):**  all around overnight.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:21:02):**  It often comes off to me as a little bit pretentious and pious, especially when it comes from people  
**[0:21:06-0:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:21:06):**  who've never worked directly in agriculture and only know about it from what they hear  
**[0:21:11-0:21:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:21:11):**  from the outside.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:21:12):**  For this and many other reasons, I'm careful not to single people out and try to talk about  
**[0:21:17-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:21:17):**  farmers as if they were a single demographic.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:21:20):**  The idea that we know more or know better how to run a farm or other ag business from  
**[0:21:24-0:21:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:21:24):**  the outside perspective, when we're just armed with some catchy Instagram slogan about  
**[0:21:29-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:21:29):**  sequestering carbon in soils, to me is representative of the presumptions and the old paradigm of  
**[0:21:34-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:21:34):**  tackling problems that I really hope this movement can move away from, because it serves  
**[0:21:39-0:21:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:21:39):**  to alienate us from the people that we hope to support and can make communication between  
**[0:21:44-0:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:21:44):**  multiple sides that much harder.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:21:46):**  I genuinely believe that we're all doing the best that we can with the knowledge, experience,  
**[0:21:52-0:21:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:21:52):**  and influences and resources that we've been given, and for any of us to push our ideas  
**[0:21:57-0:22:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:21:57):**  on others without taking the time to understand how someone arrived at the conclusions and  
**[0:22:02-0:22:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:22:02):**  the viewpoints that they have is not indicative of the compassion and the humanity that I  
**[0:22:06-0:22:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:22:06):**  would hope to aspire to personally.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:22:10):**  So let's now talk about what transition to regenerative agroforestry looks like coming  
**[0:22:15-0:22:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:22:15):**  from a common industrial model, because we can analyze the efficacy of any given method  
**[0:22:20-0:22:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:22:20):**  or practice on its own, but transition takes time, especially in risk adverse business  
**[0:22:25-0:22:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:22:25):**  models like farming.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:22:27):**  So how might this play out?  
**[0:22:29-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:22:29):**  Let's take a very common farming system.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:22:33):**  Let's suppose it's an arable system.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:22:35):**  And you know, let's say wheat.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:22:39):**  It's a wheat arable system.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:22:42):**  Wheat is a winter crop.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:22:44):**  So you're typically sowing your crop in the late summer and you're harvesting in, sorry,  
**[0:22:51-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:22:51):**  it depends where, but okay, you're sowing your crop in the fall and you're harvesting  
**[0:22:57-0:22:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:22:57):**  in the early summer too.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:22:59):**  And then what you have is a system where the most light intensive part of the year, your  
**[0:23:08-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:23:08):**  land is more or less bare.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:23:10):**  So already for that reason, you have a strong interest in using a cover crop, because that  
**[0:23:16-0:23:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:23:16):**  cover crop is going to grow and produce green manure and hold your soil in place when the  
**[0:23:22-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:23:22):**  summer storms come while your main crop is not growing.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:23:28):**  Simply by having that, you're already going to see that certain things are going to happen.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:23:31):**  You're going to need less fertilizer.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:23:34):**  And you might have, you might notice that you need fewer fungicides, that your need  
**[0:23:41-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:23:41):**  for those products are simply going down because you have begun to rekindle some eucharic  
**[0:23:46-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:23:46):**  systemic processes.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:23:47):**  You also have the pleasure of seeing that less soil is running off your land into the  
**[0:23:53-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:23:53):**  ditch or the road when a storm comes than your neighbors, simply because you have that  
**[0:23:57-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:23:57):**  cover crop in place.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:23:58):**  Now once you have that, that's money in the bank.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:24:03):**  You need to buy less fertilizer, you need to buy fewer fungicides, you need less diesel  
**[0:24:07-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:24:07):**  because you don't need to go around so often with your sprayer, and you're keeping your  
**[0:24:11-0:24:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:24:11):**  capital base because your soil is not running away.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:24:14):**  You can notice that and you'll see the financial results of that fairly rapidly.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:24:18):**  Within the first season you're going to see the financial results of that.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:24:20):**  It's not going to be massive, it's not going to trouble your income, but it's going to  
**[0:24:22-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:24:22):**  be measurable, it's going to be visible.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:24:24):**  Then you can move on.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:24:25):**  You can move to the next stage.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:24:27):**  Then why kill your cover crop with a glyphosate before you put your seed down?  
**[0:24:33-0:24:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:24:33):**  Why not do direct seeding after having gone through with a crusher?  
**[0:24:36-0:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:24:36):**  You also save some diesel there because you can have the crusher in front and the seeder  
**[0:24:39-0:24:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:24:39):**  in the back and so you only need to go through the field once as opposed to going through  
**[0:24:42-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:24:42):**  the field several times.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:24:45):**  The crusher produces a wonderful green manure that sits right on top of the soil and prevents  
**[0:24:50-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:24:50):**  that soil from drying out when there was a little bit of a late summer drought.  
**[0:24:54-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:24:54):**  So you suddenly have other advantages that are coming up, right?  
**[0:25:00-0:25:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:25:00):**  Again, then you notice that the wind is always coming from the west and because of the orientation  
**[0:25:05-0:25:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:25:05):**  of your field that wind always does drop at the wrong time.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:25:11):**  Put some trees down, put a wind break down there.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:25:15):**  If you choose a species well, that wind break is going to make you money when you harvest  
**[0:25:19-0:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:25:19):**  it 20 years down the road.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:25:21):**  Again, you're going to begin to see other benefits, right?  
**[0:25:26-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:25:26):**  Once you start down that particular thread mill, you see your revenues go up and you  
**[0:25:30-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:25:30):**  see your costs go down, then you become really interested and you start doing something else.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:25:37):**  More mixes in your cover crops.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:25:40):**  Planting them straight into a living understory rather than crushing it first.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:25:45):**  Putting alleys of trees down there.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:25:47):**  Putting alleys of small fruit in the middle of the alleys of trees.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:25:51):**  Beginning to understand how to bring animal manure in.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:25:53):**  And before you know it, you're having fun because you're managing an extremely complex  
**[0:25:57-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:25:57):**  farming system with lots and lots of different products, some of which will fail, some of  
**[0:26:02-0:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:26:02):**  which won't, but all of which will mean that you can afford the failure, which before that  
**[0:26:08-0:26:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:26:08):**  you couldn't do.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:26:10):**  Before that, when you only had one crop, if that one crop failed, it was a bloody catastrophe.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:26:14):**  Now when you have a number of different things happening on that land, when one bit of the  
**[0:26:18-0:26:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:26:18):**  system is operating as well, the other bits of the system will operate well.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:26:22):**  And all together, the productivity of that piece of land, the financial productivity,  
**[0:26:26-0:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:26:26):**  the profit and loss, it's going to be better than before.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:26:30):**  At this point, you must be, at least if not overwhelmed, somewhat discouraged by this  
**[0:26:36-0:26:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:26:36):**  breaking down at the final stage.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:26:38):**  Can you tell me about some of the things that really give you hope at this point?  
**[0:26:42-0:26:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:26:42):**  No, not yet.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:26:43):**  Well, you give me hope.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:26:44):**  The fact that the climate farmers exist gives me hope.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:26:47):**  The fact that the whole idea of regenerative farming, which was simply not an issue ten  
**[0:26:53-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:26:53):**  years ago, is now dominating some discourses.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:26:59):**  The fact that the Standard Farming magazine by the National Farmers Union in the UK now  
**[0:27:07-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:27:07):**  has at least one decent article about soils in every single issue, all that gives me hope,  
**[0:27:15-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:27:15):**  because this is not something, it's not about being an activist or being a militant.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:27:22):**  It's simply about reality.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:27:24):**  And the reality is, here is a wonderful tool, it's called agro ecosystems, and use that  
**[0:27:29-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:27:29):**  tool to make your farming system efficient.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:27:32):**  And after that, you should continue using whatever chemicals you think you need to use.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:27:36):**  We all know over time that demand for those is going to go down from your particular farm,  
**[0:27:41-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:27:41):**  because your farm is going to be better run.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:27:44):**  Let your inner geek go free.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:27:46):**  That gives me hope.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:27:48):**  What also gives me hope, interestingly enough, is the fact that some of the large corporate  
**[0:27:51-0:28:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:27:51):**  players are now investing serious money in trying to figure out how they set their state.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:28:02):**  Because right now they're doing it mostly because of their need for corporate social  
**[0:28:10-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:28:10):**  responsibility brownie points.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:28:13):**  But they really quite like to figure out a way of doing it at scale without destroying  
**[0:28:18-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:28:18):**  their business model.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:28:21):**  Now how quickly will they get there on their own through a market-driven mechanisms?  
**[0:28:29-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:28:29):**  I am not that optimistic that they can, which is why I'm a strong, unlike most Americans,  
**[0:28:35-0:28:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:28:35):**  I'm a very strong believer in regulations, right?  
**[0:28:38-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:28:38):**  Level playing field.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:28:39):**  But the fence around that level playing field is regulation, and it has to be properly designed  
**[0:28:43-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:28:43):**  by politicians using not only the input of people who understand what they understand  
**[0:28:49-0:28:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:28:49):**  from a dispassionate scientific perspective, but also people understand what they understand  
**[0:28:53-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:28:53):**  because somebody is paying the piper.  
**[0:28:57-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:28:57):**  And that I'm afraid we'll never get out of.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:28:59):**  It's a debate that's old.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:29:01):**  Plato was already pointing out 2,500 years ago how dangerous democracy was and how the  
**[0:29:06-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:29:06):**  best rule was ruled by experts.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:29:07):**  And that's what we have.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:29:08):**  European Commission is ruled by experts, right?  
**[0:29:11-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:29:11):**  But we also know what the issues with that can be, which is why we always get back to  
**[0:29:16-0:29:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:29:16):**  the sausage factory.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:29:17):**  I hope this episode today has helped to broaden your understanding of agroforestry and the  
**[0:29:21-0:29:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:29:21):**  stories from people involved at the ground level.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:29:25):**  Just like every week, I want to pose a couple of questions to you listeners.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:29:29):**  What tree and perennial food growing traditions are there in your part of the world?  
**[0:29:34-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:29:34):**  And how far back can you look to find models of mixed agroforestry in your climate and  
**[0:29:38-0:29:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:29:38):**  your culture?  
**[0:29:40-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:29:40):**  There are so many rich cultures and traditions that have been linked to forest food production,  
**[0:29:45-0:29:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:29:45):**  and I'm only starting to uncover the wisdom and insights in their different expressions  
**[0:29:49-0:29:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:29:49):**  around the world.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:29:50):**  As always, you can post your answers to join the conversation in our Discord server, and

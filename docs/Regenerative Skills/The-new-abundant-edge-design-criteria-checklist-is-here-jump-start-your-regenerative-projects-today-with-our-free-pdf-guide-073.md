**[0:02:30-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:02:30):**  Those of you who have been following us since the first season will know that I put out  
**[0:02:33-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:02:33):**  a design criteria list that we here at Abundant Edge follow ourselves when we're working with  
**[0:02:38-0:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:02:38):**  clients and organizations.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:02:40):**  Now we've updated it and completely overhauled the document that you can download for free  
**[0:02:46-0:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:02:46):**  in the accompanying PDF that goes along with this podcast.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:02:50):**  Today Neil Haggerty and I will be working through this criteria list to explain and  
**[0:02:55-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:02:55):**  give you a better understanding of how we work through information gathering, visioning,  
**[0:03:00-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:03:00):**  strategy, design and all of the other necessary steps to make sure that projects and visions  
**[0:03:06-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:03:06):**  actually come to fruition.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:03:08):**  The biggest challenge for our team here at Abundant Edge when it comes to holistic design  
**[0:03:12-0:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:03:12):**  is that there are just so many different considerations.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:03:15):**  Climate and landscape data, clients wants and needs, economic constraints and many more  
**[0:03:20-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:03:20):**  can seem overwhelming but are crucial to creating designs that work in harmony with nature and  
**[0:03:25-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:03:25):**  solve real problems.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:03:27):**  Now this is why we've put together our design criteria checklist to help us remember some  
**[0:03:31-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:03:31):**  of the most important considerations and questions to ask when designing for individuals and  
**[0:03:36-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:03:36):**  organizations alike.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:03:38):**  Now this list isn't meant to be a replacement for your own judgment or creativity as a designer  
**[0:03:42-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:03:42):**  but it reflects many of the criteria that have helped us the most and what we consider  
**[0:03:47-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:03:47):**  to be the most essential bits of information and observations that can be expanded on based  
**[0:03:52-0:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:03:52):**  on the needs of your clients or your own projects.  
**[0:03:55-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:03:55):**  We are constantly updating and revising this list so feel free to let us know if there  
**[0:03:59-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:03:59):**  are any other essential criteria missing from the list or considerations that you think  
**[0:04:03-0:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:04:03):**  are important.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:04:04):**  So in this episode Neil and I will be going through the criteria in order and explaining  
**[0:04:08-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:04:08):**  some of the ways that we've used it in designs for ourselves here on our farm and for clients  
**[0:04:13-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:04:13):**  and organizations that we've worked with in the past.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:04:16):**  We've got some great stories for how this has become relevant in our own practice and  
**[0:04:20-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:04:20):**  hopefully this will illustrate some of the ways that you can use it for yourself and  
**[0:04:24-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:04:24):**  give you some insight into why the items on this list are really important.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:04:29):**  We really hope that you enjoy this and get something out of it and we look forward to  
**[0:04:32-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:04:32):**  hearing your feedback as well as we continue to develop this document which will continue  
**[0:04:36-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:04:36):**  to be free for everybody and will continue to grow as we improve our own process.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:04:41):**  Now this list was a little bit long so we've split it up into two parts.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:04:46):**  In this episode we'll be going through the visioning and goal setting exercise all the  
**[0:04:51-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:04:51):**  way to the end of your site analysis.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:04:53):**  In next week's episode we'll take things back up from invisible structures all the way to  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:04:57):**  strategy and planning so that you can move forward in an organized and a prepared manner  
**[0:05:02-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:05:02):**  to get your designs done right the first time.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:05:05):**  Now like I mentioned before the design criteria list is available in the show notes for this  
**[0:05:09-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:05:09):**  episode at AbundantEdge.com and you can feel free to read ahead and get ahead of us before  
**[0:05:14-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:05:14):**  next week's episode.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:05:15):**  All of the resources are in the same PDF.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:05:18):**  So let's jump right on in.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:05:19):**  So let's start at the beginning and talk about defining your visions and goals.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:05:24):**  Neil, why is this so essential for us when we're working with clients to get everybody  
**[0:05:28-0:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:05:28):**  on the same page here in the beginning?  
**[0:05:30-0:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:05:30):**  Yeah, I mean I think this approach to design and setting goals is nothing unique to permaculture  
**[0:05:37-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:05:37):**  holistic design.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:05:38):**  A lot of people who work in design use this, a similar kind of a platform to this that  
**[0:05:44-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:05:44):**  starts with visioning and clear articulation of goals because the thing is you meet the  
**[0:05:51-0:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:05:51):**  vast majority of clients that I meet when I talk to them about goals they don't really  
**[0:05:55-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:05:55):**  have clear goals.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:05:56):**  They've maybe heard about permaculture, heard about regenerative farming and that's about  
**[0:06:00-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:06:00):**  it.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:06:01):**  They say like I want to have an organic farm or I want to have a permaculture garden or  
**[0:06:07-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:06:07):**  something like that and it's really not much of a clear goal so it's hard to set any kind  
**[0:06:12-0:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:06:12):**  of design criteria around.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:06:14):**  Sort of what inevitably happens in those situations when goals aren't clearly defined is that  
**[0:06:19-0:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:06:19):**  too much of the designer's bias gets put into the design or you end up with something that  
**[0:06:26-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:06:26):**  doesn't get properly run or whatever.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:06:28):**  So really spending your time to clearly and very specifically articulate your goals is  
**[0:06:34-0:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:06:34):**  very important and that's kind of a process you know.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:06:38):**  Yeah, I've always found that it's really worth taking your time on this stage.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:06:42):**  So though many of the answers that you're likely to get from these questions might be  
**[0:06:45-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:06:45):**  kind of abstract it's one of the most important categories to take your time with.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:06:50):**  Until you can define your vision and goals and get everyone involved on the same page  
**[0:06:54-0:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:06:54):**  you're likely to stumble over things like miscommunication and conflicting agendas.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:06:59):**  Like Neil just said you know a lot of people come to us or start projects with these vague  
**[0:07:04-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:07:04):**  ideas of like I want to produce a certain amount of my food and are not very specific  
**[0:07:11-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:07:11):**  on like where those calories are going to come from what species are most appropriate  
**[0:07:15-0:07:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:07:15):**  to their place in their region and getting the specifics of what it is you're actually  
**[0:07:20-0:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:07:20):**  trying to achieve can make everything later along the process so much easier.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:07:25):**  And this is also for me one of the most fun categories to work through.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:07:29):**  I would really encourage clients and organizations to dream as big as possible at this stage.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:07:34):**  This is where you're kind of unlimited by environmental factors, budget and other things  
**[0:07:40-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:07:40):**  and can really just come up with whatever it is that you want.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:07:44):**  As we move further in the design process we'll start to put limitations on this and some  
**[0:07:48-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:07:48):**  constraints on what is possible.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:07:50):**  But here is when you can be really creative.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:07:53):**  Yeah it's a time to it's a time to dream big right.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:07:58):**  And yeah do just that vision sit down with all the interested parties and the designer  
**[0:08:05-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:08:05):**  brainstorm until you can come up with a vision that you're all happy with and some really  
**[0:08:10-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:08:10):**  really specific goals right.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:08:12):**  Like I saw Oliver you're reading that book at the moment by Eric Thossenmeyer-Heimer  
**[0:08:18-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:08:18):**  how do you pronounce his name Paradise Lots.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:08:23):**  You know about him and his friend who started this like urban garden and what was their  
**[0:08:27-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:08:27):**  goal we want to have five heaped handfuls of fruit all year round from this garden.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:08:35):**  You know that's a great goal really really specific.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:08:40):**  And you know then they do then they go on and do their site analysis and they decide  
**[0:08:45-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:08:45):**  if this is actually realistic or not.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:08:47):**  So you know that can be a goal we want to have we want to have 70 percent of our diet  
**[0:08:56-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:08:56):**  provided for from this land when we want it plus extra food left over to sell plus loads  
**[0:09:03-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:09:03):**  of support plants that provide extra fertility habitat for animals that seep water into the  
**[0:09:12-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:09:12):**  soil.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:09:13):**  You know something like that is kind of like our goal for this farm for example.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:09:18):**  And so and then we you know we then go on to our site analysis and we decide is this  
**[0:09:25-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:09:25):**  realistic or not right.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:09:28):**  Basically and aside from just what the land can carry there are a lot of kind of invisible  
**[0:09:34-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:09:34):**  things that you need to work into your plan at this point.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:09:37):**  A lot of it comes along with things like lifestyle design.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:09:42):**  How do you want your lifestyle to look later along in the process of developing your site  
**[0:09:47-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:09:47):**  especially if you're keen on doing some sort of farming gardening animal raising or things  
**[0:09:55-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:09:55):**  along that line.  
**[0:09:56-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:09:56):**  It comes with a lot of maintenance.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:09:57):**  We'll get into a lot more detail about figuring out your maintenance schedule and factoring  
**[0:10:02-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:10:02):**  that into your designs later along on this criteria list.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:10:05):**  But this is when you can start to think about and design what you want your actual lifestyle  
**[0:10:10-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:10:10):**  to look like around the systems that you put in.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:10:15):**  Yeah and I think that's where a lot of these things go wrong because a lot of people fail  
**[0:10:22-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:10:22):**  to take into account their their need for social interaction.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:10:25):**  So there's definitely a big thing that I've seen.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:10:27):**  I notice it a lot with people who pass through here in in Atid Llan because here in Sunun  
**[0:10:33-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:10:33):**  now we have a wonderful community around us.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:10:35):**  We're sort of in an urban area but we're also supported by we have a lot of neighbors who  
**[0:10:40-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:10:40):**  are like-minded who are doing similar kind of things.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:10:43):**  So that that's very important and it's something I see a lot of permaculturist get wrong.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:10:49):**  They like head off to the hills with all this enthusiasm and energy to to be off the grid  
**[0:10:54-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:10:54):**  and to be sustainable and all the rest of it but because they haven't thought okay what  
**[0:10:59-0:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:10:59):**  kind of lifestyle do I want to do I want to go to a concert every now and again do I want  
**[0:11:03-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:11:03):**  to chill out with friends and they sometimes end up I've heard this from numerous people  
**[0:11:08-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:11:08):**  who end up living in very remote areas with systems that completely depend on you know  
**[0:11:15-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:11:15):**  30 40 hours of labor a week from them to keep the thing going.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:11:20):**  But then it it actually can become kind of a drag because there isn't really a business  
**[0:11:25-0:11:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:11:25):**  plan in place.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:11:26):**  There's no sort of like entrepreneurial work to go like okay can you get this to the point  
**[0:11:31-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:11:31):**  in a few years where there's profits coming in so you can maybe employ people to run some  
**[0:11:35-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:11:35):**  of the systems so you can give yourself less responsibility.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:11:37):**  Have you thought about your sort of social circle how that's going to look like because  
**[0:11:41-0:11:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:11:41):**  if you end up producing all your food but you're living in the middle of nowhere and  
**[0:11:45-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:11:45):**  then you're like driving three hours once a week or twice or once once every two weeks  
**[0:11:52-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:11:52):**  you know just to hook up with some friends or do something social or get out of the you  
**[0:11:57-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:11:57):**  know get out of this rural area where you're not met socially then suddenly all the kind  
**[0:12:03-0:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:12:03):**  of energy that you're saving by having your your lovely garden all the rest of it you're  
**[0:12:08-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:12:08):**  losing by having to travel somewhere else so you know these things really are super  
**[0:12:14-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:12:14):**  important.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:12:17):**  So with those things in mind let's work through a little bit of the list that we have here  
**[0:12:21-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:12:21):**  for the visioning exercise.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:12:23):**  Now this is just a guideline but some very useful questions that we have utilized to  
**[0:12:29-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:12:29):**  ask clients even ourselves and organizations that we've worked with to get to some of the  
**[0:12:35-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:12:35):**  most important information to set us up on the right foot.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:12:38):**  So starting from the beginning what do you see as the biggest and best potential for  
**[0:12:43-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:12:43):**  your site or your program.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:12:45):**  Oftentimes people don't think of what the maximum could be.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:12:49):**  People start thinking pragmatically from the beginning.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:12:52):**  There's plenty of time to start limiting down and being realistic later along in this criteria.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:12:58):**  Here is when I would encourage you to dream as big as possible.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:13:02):**  Second question.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:13:03):**  What do you and your team bring to the table as far as abilities and expertise.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:13:07):**  This is your human capital.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:13:09):**  These are the resources that you can't lose.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:13:12):**  These are your skill sets and things that will always be with you barring some sort  
**[0:13:16-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:13:16):**  of tragic injury.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:13:18):**  Write about what you see as the vision for the finished product of your efforts and your  
**[0:13:23-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:13:23):**  resources.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:13:24):**  Now later in this list we'll work more through timelines and figuring out what can be accomplished  
**[0:13:30-0:13:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:13:30):**  within reasonable timelines.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:13:32):**  But right now you want to think of what the finished product is.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:13:35):**  Now this can be a little bit tricky because we're dealing with living systems here which  
**[0:13:38-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:13:38):**  are dynamic and constantly evolving.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:13:42):**  But if you have a vision or an idea for what your end result looks like it will help to  
**[0:13:47-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:13:47):**  prevent this trap that many of us who are seeking success in one form or definition  
**[0:13:54-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:13:54):**  or another often fall into.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:13:56):**  Which is as soon as you reach a certain checkpoint you immediately set another target and you  
**[0:14:01-0:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:14:01):**  are never satisfied with the results that you come with.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:14:04):**  This is really important because if you can give yourself an idea of what you're working  
**[0:14:08-0:14:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:14:08):**  towards you can break out of this trap of constantly wanting more.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:14:13):**  Now that isn't to say that you're not going to be improving the efficiency and the comfort  
**[0:14:20-0:14:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:14:20):**  and the details of your site but it will help you not run away and just constantly be chasing  
**[0:14:26-0:14:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:14:26):**  the next idea of a greener pasture.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:14:30):**  You know I think in terms of farming the way I would sum that up is like dial in one system  
**[0:14:34-0:14:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:14:34):**  at a time especially if you want a profitable farm that's sort of sustaining itself.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:14:41):**  You sort of have to do this counterintuitive thing for permaculturists who always are told  
**[0:14:47-0:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:14:47):**  these things like the yield of the system is only limited by the imagination of the  
**[0:14:52-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:14:52):**  designer.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:14:53):**  You know that's true but it's also like a half truth it's limited by the time it's limited  
**[0:14:58-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:14:58):**  by the imagination and also the time and resources of the designer.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:15:03):**  So you can have a farm and you can have 10 different products that you sell from the  
**[0:15:07-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:15:07):**  farm but the best way to do it if you want it to be sustainable and if you really want  
**[0:15:11-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:15:11):**  it to work is get one thing like a market garden like an animal system.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:15:19):**  You know for us on our farm it's been the goats it's like okay we get the goats they're  
**[0:15:23-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:15:23):**  happy they're healthy.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:15:26):**  Now it's you know they give this much milk so we're going to make this much cheese and  
**[0:15:30-0:15:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:15:30):**  this much yogurt and we got to get a label on it and get it into stores and actually  
**[0:15:34-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:15:34):**  get that coming in paying its own all of its own expenses and generating extra revenue  
**[0:15:40-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:15:40):**  to put back into the farm.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:15:41):**  When it's really dialed in and it's really working then we can get the next thing going  
**[0:15:48-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:15:48):**  which for us would probably be our garden our hens are coming along now but you know  
**[0:15:52-0:15:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:15:52):**  each thing one at a time and then you create links between those things.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:15:58):**  So we'll get a lot more into that in detail as we start to figure out the strategy and  
**[0:16:03-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:16:03):**  the pragmatism of our designs.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:16:05):**  At this point we can still dream really big.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:16:08):**  This is where you can put all your kind of outlandish fantasies out there and as we move  
**[0:16:13-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:16:13):**  forward in the pragmatic parts of this criteria we'll whittle them down to what can be realistically  
**[0:16:19-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:16:19):**  achieved.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:16:20):**  So now let's start talking about some of the questions that identify some of the limiting  
**[0:16:27-0:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:16:27):**  factors and some of the expansive factors that we're working with.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:16:31):**  So what is the best case scenario?  
**[0:16:33-0:16:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:16:33):**  Now this is a bit of an abstract question because it can be answered and thought about  
**[0:16:36-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:16:36):**  in a lot of different ways.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:16:38):**  Answer it how it relates to you and your project.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:16:41):**  There's no wrong answers here this is really just information gathering so that people  
**[0:16:44-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:16:44):**  can get on the same page.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:16:46):**  Now the flip side the question would be what is the worst case scenario?  
**[0:16:50-0:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:16:50):**  What if a hurricane rolls through your site and trashes what you've been building?  
**[0:16:55-0:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:16:55):**  What if some other unforeseen way of damaging progress or limiting progress comes up?  
**[0:17:06-0:17:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:17:06):**  What are your fears and hesitations?  
**[0:17:08-0:17:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:17:08):**  Now this to me was one of the most profound questions when I started to really dial in  
**[0:17:12-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:17:12):**  the business aspect of what we do and I'm confident that this would apply to any other  
**[0:17:17-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:17:17):**  business venture as well.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:17:19):**  Often times the things holding us back most are internal our personal fears and hesitations  
**[0:17:25-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:17:25):**  are harder to name but can be much more limiting than perhaps the capacity of a piece of land  
**[0:17:32-0:17:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:17:32):**  which we can work to develop to increase the holding capacity of.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:17:36):**  This is where you've got to do a little bit of internal work.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:17:39):**  Figure out within yourself what it is that is causing you to put up roadblocks which  
**[0:17:46-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:17:46):**  are not objective but subjectively come from your own experience and your own hang-ups.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:17:52):**  I mean I think the guy who summed this up best was Darren Dougherty when he was at the  
**[0:17:57-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:17:57):**  podcast is well worth listening to it Oliver did with him with Darren Dougherty because  
**[0:18:01-0:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:18:01):**  he talks about his scale of permanence which in convention in permaculture starts with  
**[0:18:06-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:18:06):**  climate but you know he says that actually the most complex thing and the thing you have  
**[0:18:11-0:18:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:18:11):**  to put most energy into to get change is interpersonal dynamics and agreements between people and  
**[0:18:20-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:18:20):**  definitely this is another area that's hugely overlooked our own personal blocks our own  
**[0:18:25-0:18:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:18:25):**  fears it's very easy to sweep those under the carpet but they will come up and they  
**[0:18:31-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:18:31):**  will they will bite you in the butt if you don't sort them out from the get-go.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:18:39):**  So you know a business plan and agreements between partners which avoid conflicts later  
**[0:18:46-0:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:18:46):**  on are hugely hugely important things to look at and being honest with yourself and you  
**[0:18:55-0:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:18:55):**  know being willing actually to go into the places in yourself that are that are frightening  
**[0:19:01-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:19:01):**  for you to look at absolutely important because if you're going to get to the point where  
**[0:19:06-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:19:06):**  you're leading other people you really need to be centered and so yeah that that that  
**[0:19:14-0:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:19:14):**  kind of stuff that subjective stuff as Oliver says it's it's more complex and it's trickier  
**[0:19:20-0:19:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:19:20):**  so that's why it needs to be paid attention to from the start and worked on continuously  
**[0:19:25-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:19:25):**  throughout the process.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:19:27):**  Yeah definitely one of the things that is most overlooked when it comes to planning  
**[0:19:32-0:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:19:32):**  and organizing for a project people do all this external work and forget to take care  
**[0:19:37-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:19:37):**  of some of their own limiting factors as far as the visioning exercise the last two questions  
**[0:19:42-0:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:19:42):**  here are what are your organization's limiting factors or for yourself and what could come  
**[0:19:47-0:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:19:47):**  up that would prevent you from achieving your ambitions they're kind of different ways of  
**[0:19:52-0:20:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:19:52):**  coaxing out what at this point might be hard to see from from a distance but could really  
**[0:20:01-0:20:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:20:01):**  hold you back as you move forward so let's move on to defining our goals in the beginning  
**[0:20:06-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:20:06):**  there are two categories needs and wants and it's very important to understand the difference  
**[0:20:11-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:20:11):**  between these two needs are things that you must have in order to live and continue to  
**[0:20:17-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:20:17):**  be productive I count things like cooking cleaning and sleeping you can get into much  
**[0:20:24-0:20:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:20:24):**  further detail within each of those but especially as far as your buildings in your shelter if  
**[0:20:30-0:20:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:20:30):**  you can accommodate these three things cooking cleaning and sleeping the rest is kind of  
**[0:20:36-0:20:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:20:36):**  like you know storage space and comfort issues once things like comfort convenience having  
**[0:20:42-0:20:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:20:42):**  more options etc again have tons and tons of subcategories within these but making sure  
**[0:20:49-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:20:49):**  that you understand the difference between needs and wants will help you make good decisions  
**[0:20:54-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:20:54):**  moving forward when you start to reach the limit of your resources or your budget and  
**[0:20:59-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:20:59):**  you have to make difficult choices as to where to put your resources in in order to move  
**[0:21:03-0:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:21:03):**  forward next would be what would you most like to complete in one year's time five years  
**[0:21:11-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:21:11):**  ten years and twenty years now obviously these later time frames can be very hard to look  
**[0:21:17-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:21:17):**  that far forward into but try and set a loose framework you can always go back and add detail  
**[0:21:24-0:21:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:21:24):**  and redefine the direction as you get closer to those time frames but really try and put  
**[0:21:29-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:21:29):**  some detail into your first year goals and what you think is likely to be completed within  
**[0:21:36-0:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:21:36):**  that time frame yeah and I think you know in terms of looking at a farm putting in outputs  
**[0:21:46-0:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:21:46):**  from the farm as a need especially if you're looking at a farm that is designed to feed  
**[0:21:54-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:21:54):**  you first and be profitable second you know there's that like famous saying in permaculture  
**[0:22:01-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:22:01):**  that every important function should be supported by at least three elements and every important  
**[0:22:07-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:22:07):**  element should or every yeah every major element should perform at least three functions you  
**[0:22:12-0:22:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:22:12):**  know another way of looking at that is like in our case if we're deciding that we want  
**[0:22:16-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:22:16):**  to feed ourselves when we're here you know supply sixty seventy percent of our diet from  
**[0:22:24-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:22:24):**  this farm for when we're here you know we need to look at things like okay what's our  
**[0:22:28-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:22:28):**  diet comprised of we want you know this amount of protein this amount of carbohydrate those  
**[0:22:34-0:22:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:22:34):**  are like extremely important functions so a resilient farm should provide those from  
**[0:22:40-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:22:40):**  various different elements right so you know we've got our garden we're gonna grow a lot  
**[0:22:44-0:22:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:22:44):**  of beans we're gonna grow a lot of like high iron leaves and that kind of things but that's  
**[0:22:50-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:22:50):**  really only one element supporting that need that you know that supplying that need for

**[0:25:36-0:25:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:25:36):**  and expansion of enterprises in whatever your project is aiming to accomplish this is where  
**[0:25:42-0:25:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:25:42):**  you actually need to start looking into things like business plans doing some accounting  
**[0:25:46-0:25:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:25:46):**  and some of the more kind of nerdy or boring aspects of planning ahead but it's absolutely  
**[0:25:53-0:25:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:25:53):**  essential for putting in a game plan and having some numbers to reference so you can see if  
**[0:25:58-0:26:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:25:58):**  you're making progress or not and lastly how would you define resilience and stability  
**[0:26:03-0:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:26:03):**  within the context of your ambitions it's very easy to define these if you have some  
**[0:26:08-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:26:08):**  training in permaculture especially if these are land-based projects you can define resiliency  
**[0:26:13-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:26:13):**  as its ability to thrive in the changing of seasons and different climactic events including  
**[0:26:19-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:26:19):**  storms earthquakes whatever it might be and the redundancy within your systems in case  
**[0:26:25-0:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:26:25):**  a failure while inevitably a failure of one of them comes up your systems don't collapse  
**[0:26:30-0:26:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:26:30):**  yeah I think this the the business plan aspect for me is is also hugely overlooked in in  
**[0:26:38-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:26:38):**  designing because it's it really is such an important part of it and I know speaking from  
**[0:26:42-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:26:42):**  my own experience I've kind of come full circle a little bit with this sort of stuff having  
**[0:26:47-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:26:47):**  started out working in the private sector and then very much going away from it you  
**[0:26:53-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:26:53):**  know being involved with a few different NGOs and doing development kind of work but then  
**[0:26:59-0:27:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:26:59):**  you really and I really have seen how a lot of the people I talk to sort of have like  
**[0:27:05-0:27:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:27:05):**  an aversion to business it's kind of like see it as this oh you know that's like capitalism  
**[0:27:11-0:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:27:11):**  and that's bad and you know I want to like live in permaculture and be in harmony with  
**[0:27:16-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:27:16):**  nature but there's actually nothing to say you can't do both and unless we're you know  
**[0:27:23-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:27:23):**  I would love to see a restructuring of the economy and a switch to a sort of resource-based  
**[0:27:29-0:27:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:27:29):**  economy and anyone who's ever read any Charles Eisenstein stuff will know exactly what I'm  
**[0:27:34-0:27:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:27:34):**  talking about but for the meantime we sort of have to play by certain rules and the thing  
**[0:27:42-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:27:42):**  about this stuff is you know good permaculture design is so much more energy efficient that  
**[0:27:48-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:27:48):**  there's no reason it shouldn't be profitable if that's something that's important to you  
**[0:27:55-0:28:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:27:55):**  but taking the time and learning some learning from some of the amazing the amazing coaches  
**[0:28:03-0:28:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:28:03):**  and and and business experts that are out there really well worth your while.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:28:11):**  And it's important to note that there's a lot of different ways that you can actually  
**[0:28:14-0:28:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:28:14):**  gain a profit if anybody's interested in looking up I forget the resource or where to find  
**[0:28:19-0:28:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:28:19):**  it but the eight forms of capital and different ways that you can actually create a surplus  
**[0:28:25-0:28:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:28:25):**  within different types of enterprises you know the obvious ones would be in a farming  
**[0:28:29-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:28:29):**  context the harvest that you get either from animal products plant-based products or even  
**[0:28:35-0:28:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:28:35):**  fertility for your soil you want to always be having a surplus now it might not be your  
**[0:28:40-0:28:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:28:40):**  personal motivation to make money out of these enterprises though I would encourage you to  
**[0:28:44-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:28:44):**  at least entertain the option because money is an extremely useful tool you may have an  
**[0:28:50-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:28:50):**  aversion to it for a number of different reasons for staying away from kind of predatory business  
**[0:28:56-0:29:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:28:56):**  models and I completely agree with that I sympathize with those feelings but in our  
**[0:29:01-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:29:01):**  own experience I've noticed that by getting rid of the idea of profitability you're really  
**[0:29:07-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:29:07):**  kind of tying one of your hands behind your back as far as a resource that can help you  
**[0:29:11-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:29:11):**  to grow in a way that's equitable and I'm convinced that socially motivated and community  
**[0:29:18-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:29:18):**  motivated enterprises with a profitable business model can actually be a lot more effective  
**[0:29:24-0:29:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:29:24):**  and can spend more of their time and resources on increasing the efficiency and the abundance  
**[0:29:29-0:29:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:29:29):**  of their systems rather than constantly going and you know either begging for funds begging  
**[0:29:35-0:29:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:29:35):**  is kind of a harsh word or looking for donations or constantly be doing some sort of fundraising  
**[0:29:41-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:29:41):**  just to keep them afloat if you have a profitable business model that isn't to say that you  
**[0:29:46-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:29:46):**  have to use those funds or those resources to enrich your own life you can choose how  
**[0:29:51-0:29:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:29:51):**  you use them and I'm convinced that these socially motivated enterprises have much more  
**[0:29:59-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:29:59):**  potential in restructuring the economy in a positive way in an equitable way for all  
**[0:30:04-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:30:04):**  people if they're leveraged correctly and people use the resources in a socially responsible  
**[0:30:09-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:30:09):**  way yeah definitely I think and it helps to have a sound business model as well to to  
**[0:30:17-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:30:17):**  get people out of scarcity mode you know you can really start giving if you have this attitude  
**[0:30:23-0:30:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:30:23):**  which I think a lot of permaculturists have of wanting to give more than you're receiving  
**[0:30:28-0:30:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:30:28):**  it was a lovely concept I was introduced to when I was working in EMAP the Mesoamerican  
**[0:30:38-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:30:38):**  Permaculture Institute and the guys who run that place teach their their Mayan farmers  
**[0:30:45-0:30:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:30:45):**  and they teach permaculture as a sort of a way of maintaining their their own heritage  
**[0:30:49-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:30:49):**  but one of the things Ronnie the director always talks about there is how previously  
**[0:30:54-0:30:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:30:54):**  in Mayan cultures the the person who was wealthiest in the economy was the one who who gave the  
**[0:30:59-0:31:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:30:59):**  most not who had the most because if you're living in a in a healthy community you know  
**[0:31:06-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:31:06):**  the more you give the more you will you will receive back in kind that's what we see from  
**[0:31:11-0:31:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:31:11):**  how symbiosis works in nature and and all the rest of it but to set yourself up into  
**[0:31:16-0:31:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:31:16):**  in that position where you can really be a positive influence in your community and your  
**[0:31:21-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:31:21):**  ecosystem it has to be from a sound base you can't you you will very quickly slip back  
**[0:31:26-0:31:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:31:26):**  into a scarcity mindset if if your basic needs are not being met or if you're panicking about  
**[0:31:34-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:31:34):**  being able to pay your bills for the upcoming month you know and we say all of this not  
**[0:31:40-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:31:40):**  to get people kind of discouraged or overwhelmed with the idea that their enterprises have  
**[0:31:45-0:31:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:31:45):**  to be profitable immediately frankly our own isn't yet and we're six months into developing  
**[0:31:50-0:31:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:31:50):**  this farm but we do have a plan to switching over from coming out of our savings and our  
**[0:31:56-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:31:56):**  investment fund in this place to as quickly as possible paying for the development of  
**[0:32:02-0:32:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:32:02):**  this place as well as the salaries of the people who are supporting us through the earnings  
**[0:32:06-0:32:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:32:06):**  of the products that we are putting out yeah and it's a very important process for us to  
**[0:32:12-0:32:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:32:12):**  to go into and it's why like as designers and consultants you know eighty percent of  
**[0:32:17-0:32:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:32:17):**  our time for the next year or two will actually be in developing our own systems because what  
**[0:32:22-0:32:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:32:22):**  i'm finding with this and i think you too oliver is that our own the quality of our  
**[0:32:28-0:32:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:32:28):**  own services is evolving and improving as we're seeing our own farm evolve right so  
**[0:32:37-0:32:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:32:37):**  really our main goal for our place is to develop this resiliency and this profitability in  
**[0:32:44-0:32:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:32:44):**  our farm so that we can then go out and help our clients do the same thing yeah i think  
**[0:32:50-0:32:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:32:50):**  that's really well said now let's move on to the next section which is site analysis  
**[0:32:55-0:33:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:32:55):**  and inventory of resources and limitations so anyone who's been through a pdc or has  
**[0:33:02-0:33:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:33:02):**  learned much about permaculture knows that gathering information from the beginning and  
**[0:33:06-0:33:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:33:06):**  learning to read your landscape and the patterns in nature is absolutely essential to to be  
**[0:33:11-0:33:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:33:11):**  able to work with it effectively and so site analysis and mapping needs to be the next  
**[0:33:16-0:33:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:33:16):**  step once you get on the same page with the people involved with your project as to the  
**[0:33:21-0:33:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:33:21):**  direction that you're going in and the limitations that you may come up against now it's time  
**[0:33:26-0:33:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:33:26):**  for us to really understand our landscape and the ecology within it so that we can make  
**[0:33:30-0:33:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:33:30):**  informed decisions that advance our agenda while working in symbiosis with nature to  
**[0:33:37-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:33:37):**  reduce the amount that we have to kind of fight or manipulate against it to get our  
**[0:33:41-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:33:41):**  will in fact if we design correctly with the information we're about to gather the natural  
**[0:33:48-0:33:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:33:48):**  systems around us and that we're working with can help to advance our own agenda as well  
**[0:33:53-0:33:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:33:53):**  so starting out with mapping you want to at least get the compass coordinates the general  
**[0:33:57-0:34:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:33:57):**  contours and any major features within the boundaries of the site now this is a bare  
**[0:34:02-0:34:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:34:02):**  minimum any other information or specificity that you can put into your map is going to  
**[0:34:09-0:34:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:34:09):**  be a huge resource moving forward but if you can at least accommodate those things that  
**[0:34:13-0:34:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:34:13):**  I just mentioned you should be able to move along at least effectively with some of the  
**[0:34:18-0:34:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:34:18):**  most essential information from there you want to do a climate assessment now there's  
**[0:34:24-0:34:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:34:24):**  a number of different ways to do this and a couple of different pieces of key information  
**[0:34:29-0:34:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:34:29):**  that you need to make sure that you have access to first of all the overall climate and this  
**[0:34:34-0:34:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:34:34):**  is going back from trends notice the difference between climate and weather so in one season  
**[0:34:40-0:34:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:34:40):**  you're not getting an idea of what the climate is you need to go and look at data from honestly  
**[0:34:45-0:34:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:34:45):**  as long back as possible because especially in about the last 10 or 15 years a lot of  
**[0:34:51-0:34:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:34:51):**  climactic conditions have started to shift and you're only going to notice how those  
**[0:34:55-0:35:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:34:55):**  have been shifting if you get a larger picture of what was normal from a longer view backwards  
**[0:35:03-0:35:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:35:03):**  you also want to get an idea of the average annual rainfall again from as far back as  
**[0:35:07-0:35:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:35:07):**  possible the major seasons and their average high and low temperatures are essential for  
**[0:35:13-0:35:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:35:13):**  starting out from there you want to look into natural disaster assessment now this includes  
**[0:35:18-0:35:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:35:18):**  everything from earthquake risk volcanoes storms and especially flood or drought potential  
**[0:35:25-0:35:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:35:25):**  these can be extremely limiting factors and you need to understand that the trends are  
**[0:35:31-0:35:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:35:31):**  starting to accelerate the things that you would have previously considered to be a hundred  
**[0:35:36-0:35:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:35:36):**  year weather events or damaging or huge disturbance factors on your site can start to happen now  
**[0:35:43-0:35:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:35:43):**  every 10 maybe even five years because of the way that climate change is affecting different  
**[0:35:49-0:35:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:35:49):**  regions around the world and it does affect them differently  
**[0:35:57-0:36:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:35:57):**  yeah and then this is the time where you know it starts to get real as Oliver was saying  
**[0:36:02-0:36:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:36:02):**  and you know Shad in Atidlan Organics always has a great saying that he teaches in his  
**[0:36:08-0:36:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:36:08):**  permaculture courses which is like this is where you look for that first boom moment  
**[0:36:12-0:36:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:36:12):**  aha moment where the goals that you expressed in the visioning session congruent meet a  
**[0:36:20-0:36:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:36:20):**  point of congruence with your site analysis so the best design is the convergence of well  
**[0:36:27-0:36:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:36:27):**  articulated goals and thorough site analysis I think that's like you know for me that's  
**[0:36:32-0:36:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:36:32):**  key to understanding that and it may be that you do your site analysis and you got to go  
**[0:36:37-0:36:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:36:37):**  back and relook at your goals but the closer they were sort of to your kind of to your  
**[0:36:42-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:36:42):**  heart and the better they were written down from the start before you even started to  
**[0:36:49-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:36:49):**  do this so those two things need to be separate and then this is the point during the site  
**[0:36:54-0:37:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:36:54):**  analysis where you sit down and say yeah we can we can achieve this dream plus do all  
**[0:37:00-0:37:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:37:00):**  these other things from this site or no we can't it's time to revisit it and you get  
**[0:37:06-0:37:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:37:06):**  these kind of like design is always a cyclical process that's also very important so you're  
**[0:37:11-0:37:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:37:11):**  always accepting feedback from whatever stage you're at and then you know revisiting things  
**[0:37:17-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:37:17):**  and it's the same it's actually the exact same with your inner work and your intergroup work  
**[0:37:25-0:37:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:37:25):**  yeah absolutely this criteria list is meant to go in linear order as far as the progressions  
**[0:37:30-0:37:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:37:30):**  that you work through but it doesn't at all mean that you don't go back after you've gathered  
**[0:37:35-0:37:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:37:35):**  more information to revise some of the earlier sectors and like Neil said this is a cyclical  
**[0:37:40-0:37:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:37:40):**  process once you come to certain conclusions and start to execute a lot of the plans and  
**[0:37:47-0:37:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:37:47):**  the individual tasks that are on your list you're going to learn a lot of things that  
**[0:37:52-0:37:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:37:52):**  are going to change the assessment of the site might change up the the resources that  
**[0:37:57-0:38:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:37:57):**  you're working with either accelerating how fast you're working through your budget or  
**[0:38:01-0:38:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:38:01):**  even slow it down and as more information comes in you should feel you should feel fine  
**[0:38:08-0:38:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:38:08):**  about going back and revising some of the steps along this list and again this should  
**[0:38:14-0:38:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:38:14):**  be pretty familiar to anyone who's done a permaculture trade because these are two major  
**[0:38:18-0:38:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:38:18):**  design principles one is accept feedback and apply self-regulation so and the other one  
**[0:38:29-0:38:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:38:29):**  is designed from patterns to details so those those two things are very prevalent here and  
**[0:38:35-0:38:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:38:35):**  that's I think a lot of what they were trying to get across that you're always willing to  
**[0:38:40-0:38:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:38:40):**  accept feedback and and change your plans and not get attached to ideas and that you  
**[0:38:46-0:38:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:38:46):**  start with these very broad patterns like climate like aspect you know this again where  
**[0:38:53-0:38:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:38:53):**  like using the scale of permanence is is very important and I'll be putting an article up  
**[0:38:59-0:39:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:38:59):**  on the website soon about using the scale of permanence in design you know and that's  
**[0:39:06-0:39:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:39:06):**  like a very very good thing to refer to at this point as well.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:39:12):**  So again any of you familiar with permaculture design will understand what I'm talking about  
**[0:39:17-0:39:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:39:17):**  on the next section which is defining your sectors now obviously this is going to change  
**[0:39:22-0:39:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:39:22):**  as you start to implement part of your design your sectors are going to shift if not completely  
**[0:39:28-0:39:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:39:28):**  transform as parts of the design become implemented but at least from the beginning you want to  
**[0:39:33-0:39:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:39:33):**  look at where the sun patterns are and how they change in different seasons how different  
**[0:39:38-0:39:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:39:38):**  aspects of the climate affect different areas of your site directly wind certain migrational  
**[0:39:47-0:39:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:39:47):**  movements can be factored into this and there's a whole list of other things that you can  
**[0:39:51-0:39:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:39:51):**  put into that sector map you also want to closely analyze your contour and your slope  
**[0:39:57-0:40:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:39:57):**  where and how does water and airflow move along your site this is going to be essential  
**[0:40:03-0:40:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:40:03):**  when it comes to dispersing these resources effectively without fighting against the natural  
**[0:40:08-0:40:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:40:08):**  patterns.  
**[0:40:11-0:40:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:40:11):**  Yeah and this is like you know this is where you get to the crux of your design you're  
**[0:40:15-0:40:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:40:15):**  into the meat of it there's so many good resources on on water management this is the first point  
**[0:40:21-0:40:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:40:21):**  that you can intervene on the land and make you know for relatively low energy inputs  
**[0:40:26-0:40:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:40:26):**  get get huge rewards but it absolutely has to be climate specific and the type of lands  
**[0:40:35-0:40:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:40:35):**  so you know you see this mistake as well because people take a do a permaculture course and  
**[0:40:41-0:40:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:40:41):**  you know the things that jump out at them for example are swales terraces compost and  
**[0:40:47-0:40:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:40:47):**  it's like brilliant all great techniques sometimes you know so knowing you know as oliver was  
**[0:40:55-0:41:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:40:55):**  talking about what are the how much rain is going to fall in a season what's a major weather  
**[0:41:01-0:41:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:41:01):**  event look like are all my swales and ponds going to fill up and and burst through the  
**[0:41:07-0:41:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:41:07):**  there the the the banks you know so like you will be you slowly arrive at this point and  
**[0:41:14-0:41:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:41:14):**  it becomes obvious to you what type of earthworks are actually appropriate and yeah but this  
**[0:41:22-0:41:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:41:22):**  is where this is where you start to see results really really quickly if you've done all the  
**[0:41:26-0:41:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:41:26):**  other parts properly moving here to another couple of assessments that are really key  
**[0:41:32-0:41:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:41:32):**  the definition of sectors contour and slope should definitely give you an idea of what  
**[0:41:38-0:41:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:41:38):**  types of micro climates you're working with and different areas of your site these might  
**[0:41:45-0:41:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:41:45):**  affect your growing potential minorly and it might affect it very substantially an assessment  
**[0:41:52-0:41:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:41:52):**  of these different areas and how they change the micro climates around them are really  
**[0:41:57-0:42:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:41:57):**  worth taking into account and at this point we're going into much more detail on our site  
**[0:42:02-0:42:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:42:02):**  analysis the drainage ability of your soil is another thing to really take stock in and  
**[0:42:08-0:42:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:42:08):**  you want to try this test out on different areas of your site in order to get an idea  
**[0:42:14-0:42:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:42:14):**  of how water gets absorbed or infiltrated into the soil on different areas where you're  
**[0:42:20-0:42:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:42:20):**  thinking about cultivating now if anybody's tried the the bucket test essentially you  
**[0:42:27-0:42:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:42:27):**  dig a hole about two feet deep and two feet in diameter from there you pour in a five  
**[0:42:32-0:42:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:42:32):**  gallon bucket of water and keep track of how long it takes for that water to absorb entirely  
**[0:42:37-0:42:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:42:37):**  into the soil once the hole is completely empty you want to divide the number the time  
**[0:42:44-0:42:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:42:44):**  by five to get the rate of absorption of one gallon of water now knowing how fast the water  
**[0:42:50-0:42:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:42:50):**  gets absorbed into the soil is going to give you a good idea of what types of soil amendments  
**[0:42:56-0:43:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:42:56):**  you're going to need to be able to grow certain types of crops obviously some of which are  
**[0:43:00-0:43:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:43:00):**  heavier feeders than others and need to be babied a little bit more and have different  
**[0:43:05-0:43:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:43:05):**  water what different water necessities from there where are the access points on your  
**[0:43:12-0:43:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:43:12):**  site roads driveways paths docks etc these are really going to determine the energy flow  
**[0:43:20-0:43:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:43:20):**  flows and how you have access to different resources and how efficiently you can move  
**[0:43:24-0:43:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:43:24):**  them to other sites on your land major features like vegetation what's already there everything  
**[0:43:32-0:43:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:43:32):**  from huge rocks and trees to gullies creeks and previously disturbed sites are going to  
**[0:43:37-0:43:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:43:37):**  give you a lot of information about what you can do with what's already there yeah this  
**[0:43:43-0:43:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:43:43):**  is just pretty simple stuff really you know the bucket test you're really just looking  
**[0:43:46-0:43:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:43:46):**  at what does water do on this type of land you know because yeah you've got your climate  
**[0:43:52-0:43:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:43:52):**  so you know how much rain falls in a year but the type of soil you have will make it  
**[0:43:57-0:44:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:43:57):**  radically different the implications how you hold it on the land how much seepage are you  
**[0:44:02-0:44:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:44:02):**  going to get and you know another like really simple one to do again like in in terms of  
**[0:44:09-0:44:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:44:09):**  principles like the whole observe and interact thing is and these are just like tools for  
**[0:44:14-0:44:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:44:14):**  helping you to observe better so another like simple one you can do is just leave a five  
**[0:44:21-0:44:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:44:21):**  gallon bucket out in your yard and watch how long it takes to fill up with water and then  
**[0:44:27-0:44:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:44:27):**  what happens to that water go and look at it in a major rain event and see how is like  
**[0:44:33-0:44:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:44:33):**  it just overflowing does it freeze and then burst you know those types of things that  
**[0:44:42-0:44:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:44:42):**  will tell you like a lot about you know okay if we put a pipe along here you know is the  
**[0:44:49-0:44:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:44:49):**  water going to freeze in it and burst all these kinds of things that you might not think  
**[0:44:54-0:44:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:44:54):**  of these these things will just kind of like help you to improve your sort of intuition  
**[0:44:59-0:45:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:44:59):**  and your connection to the place now the last real assessment that I want to go into detail  
**[0:45:05-0:45:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:45:05):**  on here and obviously there are so many more pieces of information that you can mine for  
**[0:45:10-0:45:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:45:10):**  on a site but it's a concept of relative and absolute elevation now absolute elevation  
**[0:45:17-0:45:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:45:17):**  is your elevation above sea level how high are you above sea level now here in Guatemala  
**[0:45:23-0:45:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:45:23):**  on our particular site we're almost one mile up above sea level and though we are in the  
**[0:45:29-0:45:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:45:29):**  subtropics and with all the implications of a very warm and mild climate that that implies  
**[0:45:34-0:45:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:45:34):**  our elevation actually makes it even more mild and we get much cooler temperatures here  
**[0:45:40-0:45:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:45:40):**  than we do closer down to the coast even though they're at the same latitude yeah that's actually  
**[0:45:45-0:45:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:45:45):**  a huge difference you know in terms of the way this ecosystem behaves we get way less  
**[0:45:51-0:46:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:45:51):**  rain you know we get like actually quite cool night temperatures in at certain times a year  
**[0:46:03-0:46:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:46:03):**  you know we get we get fog and then cloud settling over us high winds and very seasonal  
**[0:46:11-0:46:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:46:11):**  winds so you know like big big difference to so it makes us like we're much more similar  
**[0:46:19-0:46:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:46:19):**  in climate to a bunch of places in Peru which is miles away than we are to places half an  
**[0:46:27-0:46:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:46:27):**  hour's drive away where the elevation changes dramatically now the difference between absolute  
**[0:46:34-0:46:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:46:34):**  elevation and relative elevation is how high are you up above or below the surrounding  
**[0:46:40-0:46:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:46:40):**  terrain so we're in a mountain valley here and we're actually fairly high up the valley  
**[0:46:45-0:46:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:46:45):**  everything kind of goes to its lowest point around here to the level of lake Atitlan which  
**[0:46:51-0:46:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:46:51):**  is kind of the biggest climactic feature as far as microclimates go for our region this  
**[0:46:57-0:47:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:46:57):**  big body of water helps to mediate temperature differences but also is one of the driving  
**[0:47:03-0:47:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:47:03):**  factors to the high winds that we get around here even though we're fairly sheltered in  
**[0:47:07-0:47:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:47:07):**  the valley the other advantage of being high up in this valley is that we are much less  
**[0:47:13-0:47:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:47:13):**  prone to things like flooding water is not really going to stay on our site because of  
**[0:47:19-0:47:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:47:19):**  the inclination or disinclination of the land itself it's going to run off rather quickly  
**[0:47:25-0:47:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:47:25):**  fortunately we're not on a very steep site so we have the potential to put in swales  
**[0:47:30-0:47:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:47:30):**  terraces and other things to slow it down but your relative elevation can determine  
**[0:47:35-0:47:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:47:35):**  a lot as far as risk assessment for your land itself let's move on to another subcategory  
**[0:47:40-0:47:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:47:40):**  of this inventory of materials now this really applies more to the things that you want to  
**[0:47:47-0:47:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:47:47):**  build or amend as far as infrastructure on your site from a natural building perspective  
**[0:47:52-0:47:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:47:52):**  you always want to take a look at what materials are available on your site already building  
**[0:47:57-0:48:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:47:57):**  materials such as clay soil stones lumber and suitable grasses could save you tons of  
**[0:48:02-0:48:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:48:02):**  money on construction or at least for importing other materials from further away what materials  
**[0:48:09-0:48:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:48:09):**  are available locally so moving one step out into maybe your zone two within your community  
**[0:48:17-0:48:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:48:17):**  check with your neighbors your community boards your municipal bodies even dumpsters and landfills  
**[0:48:22-0:48:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:48:22):**  could have perfectly good building materials and tools taking one more step out into perhaps  
**[0:48:27-0:48:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:48:27):**  a zone three or a zone four let's look at what materials are available at a distance  
**[0:48:33-0:48:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:48:33):**  but ideally that have the lowest embodied energy and the lowest toxicity things like  
**[0:48:38-0:48:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:48:38):**  recycled or refurbished materials giveaways on places like craigslist anything second  
**[0:48:44-0:48:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:48:44):**  hand or recycled before buying new can help you make the most ecological choices even  
**[0:48:50-0:48:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:48:50):**  when you have to import things from further on now I can go into a lot more detail on  
**[0:48:54-0:48:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:48:54):**  how to source materials like this but we'll save that for another episode as I have a  
**[0:48:58-0:49:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:48:58):**  lot of writings on this already in some of the articles on the website alright so that's  
**[0:49:03-0:49:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:49:03):**  where we're going to leave it for today just so that we don't run too long or overwhelm  
**[0:49:07-0:49:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:49:07):**  anybody with the details of this design criteria but join us again next Friday as we'll be  
**[0:49:13-0:49:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-intricacies-and-challenges-of-holistic-design/#t=0:49:13):**  picking up where we left off and completing our description of the abundant edge design

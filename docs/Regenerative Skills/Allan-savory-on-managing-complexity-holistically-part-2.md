**[0:00:00-0:00:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:00:00):**  This is Regenerative Skills, the podcast helping you to learn the skills and solutions to create  
**[0:00:08-0:00:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:00:08):**  an abundant and connected future.  
**[0:00:10-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:00:10):**  I'm your host, Oliver Gautier.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:00:14):**  I am once again honored to be representing my friends at New Society Publishers, the  
**[0:00:19-0:00:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:00:19):**  book publishers that were a big inspiration to me even before I started working with ecologies  
**[0:00:24-0:00:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:00:24):**  and natural buildings and way before podcasting.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:00:28):**  Their titles like The Natural Plaster Book and Timber Framing for the Rest of Us really  
**[0:00:32-0:00:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:00:32):**  made me believe that I could build my own home, which I eventually did.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:00:37):**  And later volumes like Ecopreneuring, Unlearn Rewild, and Building Community have offered  
**[0:00:42-0:00:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:00:42):**  tons of inspiration and even helped to shape my world view.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:00:45):**  Whether you're looking for practical tips on growing and preserving food, exploring  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:00:49):**  complex challenges in your own life, or sometimes just searching for hope and inspiration in  
**[0:00:54-0:00:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:00:54):**  a crazy world where you don't feel like you fit in, you'll find exactly what you're  
**[0:00:58-0:01:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:00:58):**  looking for and more at newsociety.com.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:01:01):**  Hey everybody, and welcome back to the second part of my interview with Alan Savory.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:01:08):**  If you haven't heard the first part of this session, you can find the link in the show  
**[0:01:11-0:01:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:01:11):**  notes on the website.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:01:13):**  Make sure you check it out first if you haven't already, it'll give context to this portion.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:01:18):**  Now last week we covered some of Alan's insights into where he's putting his efforts  
**[0:01:21-0:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:01:21):**  at this stage of his career, and the aspects of holistic management that are tough for  
**[0:01:25-0:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:01:25):**  many to grasp despite the simplicity of the practice.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:01:29):**  He also made the important distinction that management is something that you practice  
**[0:01:33-0:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:01:33):**  rather than apply, and how this shift in language can precipitate a change in mindset as well.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:01:39):**  Now we left off last week with Alan describing some examples of people who he's worked  
**[0:01:43-0:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:01:43):**  with who have made quick and remarkable breakthroughs working with their holistic contexts, and  
**[0:01:48-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:01:48):**  we'll pick up today with a continuation of that question.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:01:51):**  Now since I've come to understand just how broadly holistic management can be practiced  
**[0:01:56-0:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:01:56):**  despite its primary association with grazing animals, I've been keen to understand some  
**[0:02:00-0:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:02:00):**  examples of the different contexts in which people have used this framework outside of  
**[0:02:04-0:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:02:04):**  farming.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:02:05):**  So let's jump right back in.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:02:09):**  In these other examples that you've talked about, where have you seen success in unlikely  
**[0:02:15-0:02:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:02:15):**  places?  
**[0:02:17-0:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:02:17):**  This idea of managing holistically is the first breakthrough in that from a mechanistic  
**[0:02:26-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:02:26):**  worldview to a holistic worldview that is as big a shift as from a flat world to the  
**[0:02:32-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:02:32):**  round world.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:02:33):**  It's the second big shift probably in human history.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:02:37):**  So we're just in the infancy in it, and I don't know if it's close to the history of  
**[0:02:44-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:02:44):**  it, but if we can keep it simple, keep it growing, we might reach there.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:02:51):**  Cases I'm involved with, one of them is one that's got awards, as the case in Africa,  
**[0:02:58-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:02:58):**  where at the Africa Center, we're managing wildlife, land, people, etc. on a large block  
**[0:03:06-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:03:06):**  of land.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:03:07):**  It's one of the campuses of our Savory Institute.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:03:10):**  Now, when people come there, we can show phenomenal success on the land, just mind boggling.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:03:18):**  And there's been National Geographic have been and filmed there, NPR, etc.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:03:22):**  They've been amazing comments made on it.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:03:25):**  I was just there about three, four weeks ago.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:03:29):**  And we've got fresh water flowing out of the ground, where we haven't known it for 100  
**[0:03:35-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:03:35):**  years, after 17 bad years.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:03:38):**  And we've got geese and things where we're breeding where we hadn't had them before and  
**[0:03:42-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:03:42):**  so on.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:03:43):**  And yet, we've got parts of the land that are still in terrible shape, terrible condition.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:03:49):**  It is taking us that long.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:03:52):**  And that's looking at the land.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:03:53):**  And then you've got the human side of it, and the economic side of it.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:03:57):**  And we have battled endlessly with global, well, with a whole collapse of the national  
**[0:04:04-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:04:04):**  economy, with corruption, with politics, with all.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:04:07):**  I mean, Zimbabwe is one of the most problematic countries in the world at the moment.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:04:13):**  But throughout all of that, and managing holistically, far from perfectly, I mean, I can criticize  
**[0:04:19-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:04:19):**  so much of what they're doing any day.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:04:22):**  Despite that, we've had these incredible results.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:04:26):**  So it shows me we don't have to be perfect, or anywhere near it.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:04:32):**  But if we keep the principles of flight, if we keep the principles right, it will keep  
**[0:04:38-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:04:38):**  getting better.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:04:39):**  And so I find that with families that I talked to down there, I'm still dealing with families  
**[0:04:46-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:04:46):**  that I dealt with, oh, nearly 50 years ago, and started helping them.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:04:52):**  In the TED Talk, I talk of one family with their flag still flying.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:04:56):**  I'm still talking and dealing with one of those kids in that family who's now teaching  
**[0:05:01-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:05:01):**  people.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:05:02):**  And I'm still doing it.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:05:03):**  Now, on their own farms, nothing is perfect.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:05:06):**  But they're still just getting better and better and better.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:05:09):**  So that's what we need to be doing.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:05:11):**  It's realizing that you're just managing your life, you're managing the environment, and  
**[0:05:15-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:05:15):**  you're managing in an economy that is driving environmental destruction, and the destruction  
**[0:05:21-0:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:05:21):**  of every farm, every business in the world.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:05:24):**  There can be no sustainable business until agriculture is truly managed holistically  
**[0:05:32-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:05:32):**  and regenerative.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:05:34):**  And so all we can do is look for constant improvement advance, not seek perfection.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:05:43):**  Just keep the principles, keep the simplicity, and keep improving.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:05:47):**  That's all I hope for.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:05:49):**  And I know that, as I've said before, this will take centuries, and we will be overrun  
**[0:05:57-0:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:05:57):**  by violence and destruction worse than anybody can even imagine today.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:06:04):**  We will be overrun, or we've got to, I believe, try to find a way to bring that Berlin Wall  
**[0:06:09-0:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:06:09):**  down, which I'm trying in this terribly small voice of mine at COP to see.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:06:16):**  Because if the first government begins to manage holistically, and others see and observing,  
**[0:06:24-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:06:24):**  I'm suggesting we do one test case and have international observers from all the major  
**[0:06:30-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:06:30):**  nations, just observing, then I think it'll start the domino effect.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:06:35):**  Because there isn't a politician in the world that knows what to do, not one.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:06:41):**  And everybody's telling them what they should do.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:06:45):**  And at COP, they will get endless resolutions on what they should do.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:06:51):**  But nobody will tell them how to do it.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:06:53):**  Yeah, it's a completely different way of thinking about problems, not just finding a solution,  
**[0:06:59-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:06:59):**  but actually managing the path to get to it, and making sure that you stay in a direction  
**[0:07:05-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:07:05):**  that gets you closer to the results that you say you desire.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:07:09):**  And that really brings me back to one of the challenges that I've had in this learning  
**[0:07:12-0:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:07:12):**  experience is that I've found that maybe it's just my own life, but I've definitely seen  
**[0:07:17-0:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:07:17):**  it in the feedback from my peers along this course as well.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:07:22):**  We're not often challenged to think aspirationally.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:07:26):**  We have endless examples of worst case scenarios and avoidance of all the things that could  
**[0:07:33-0:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:07:33):**  go wrong.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:07:34):**  But we're often not provoked to think as to what is the best thing that could come out?  
**[0:07:39-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:07:39):**  What is the highest potential?  
**[0:07:40-0:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:07:40):**  What is the best case scenario?  
**[0:07:43-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:07:43):**  And I believe that this is really starting to cripple our collective imagination.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:07:48):**  People struggle to think in this way much more than they do in the negative.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:07:53):**  Have you found the same?  
**[0:07:55-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:07:55):**  And have you found some questions that help to unlock the positive potential in people's  
**[0:08:00-0:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:08:00):**  imaginations and not just the worst case?  
**[0:08:03-0:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:08:03):**  You know, I don't really know how to answer that.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:08:08):**  I personally just get extremely frustrated.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:08:13):**  This is partly old age.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:08:15):**  I say I now understand why old buffalo bulls lie away on their own.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:08:23):**  I get extremely frustrated because people get together and I hear it.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:08:27):**  And I get on chats with very good friends of mine.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:08:30):**  I was on one just a day ago.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:08:35):**  A fellow who's doing great things in the economic field, etc.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:08:40):**  But it's all theorizing and what we could do and we should think of systems things.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:08:46):**  And it's discussion, it's words, it's words, it's words, it's smokescreen.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:08:52):**  If we just stop that and just come down to saying, well, what is the problem?  
**[0:08:59-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:08:59):**  Let's start dealing with the cause.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:09:01):**  Because everybody knows that if you don't deal with the cause of a problem yourself,  
**[0:09:07-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:09:07):**  I find people getting into the smokescreen of discussions and theorizing and what would  
**[0:09:14-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:09:14):**  give us hope, what wouldn't give us hope, what scenarios.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:09:19):**  We can do those and they can give us hope.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:09:22):**  But if we don't address the root cause of the problem, it's not built on any foundation.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:09:29):**  So I really just would wish we could somehow get people to stop talking and just do it.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:09:36):**  I would love it.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:09:37):**  I mean, if I was with a group of people again, anywhere in the world working with them, as  
**[0:09:44-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:09:44):**  I do in fact, if I facilitate say a policy session with any group, I did this with 35  
**[0:09:52-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:09:52):**  years from two political parties.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:09:57):**  People on our staff, knowing I was going to meet with them, appealed to me not to touch  
**[0:10:03-0:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:10:03):**  agriculture or land because it's so volatile.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:10:07):**  And they were in such violence between the political parties.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:10:11):**  And there was this hostility in the room when I got there.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:10:14):**  And with them, I just talked about what we were doing and didn't seem to be leading anywhere.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:10:21):**  We were getting into worse and worse trouble with agriculture and soil destruction and  
**[0:10:27-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:10:27):**  everything else.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:10:28):**  And then I said, right now, the reason for this is the way we develop policies.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:10:35):**  If we look at another way of developing policies, one of the first things we do need is this  
**[0:10:40-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:10:40):**  new concept of a national holistic context.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:10:45):**  So you see, I stopped all discussion about the problem because there would have been  
**[0:10:51-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:10:51):**  arguments and fights over that, like permaculture versus other agriculture or some other, there  
**[0:10:57-0:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:10:57):**  would have been arguments.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:10:58):**  So one of the rules when you start managing holistically is stop all discussion and argument  
**[0:11:05-0:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:11:05):**  about the issues and the problems, because we've done that for 10,000 years.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:11:11):**  So stop that.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:11:13):**  And so I got to them and I said, all right, we're all Zimbabweans, we're different political  
**[0:11:18-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:11:18):**  parties in conflict, but let's ignore that for a minute.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:11:23):**  I want our lives to be, and everybody's agreed.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:11:28):**  And we spilt out how we wanted our lives to be deep stuff.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:11:33):**  And then what about our land?  
**[0:11:35-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:11:35):**  Because that sustains us.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:11:38):**  So our land and our rivers and so on, how will they have to be three, four, 500 years  
**[0:11:42-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:11:42):**  from now if our descendants aren't just killing each other.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:11:48):**  And we spelt that out, clean rivers flowing again, abundant biodiversity, healthy soils,  
**[0:11:56-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:11:56):**  et cetera.  
**[0:11:57-0:11:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:11:57):**  Nobody had any disagreement at all.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:11:59):**  And then I said, well, now we're also going to have to trade with other nations and so  
**[0:12:04-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:12:04):**  on and so forth.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:12:05):**  They spelt all that out.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:12:06):**  And I said, we can't make them support us.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:12:08):**  We can't make them like us.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:12:11):**  We can only change ourselves.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:12:13):**  Gandhi's advice, be the change you expect.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:12:15):**  I said, how are we going to have to behave for other nations to support us?  
**[0:12:21-0:12:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:12:21):**  They didn't even thought of that.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:12:24):**  So we spelt that out.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:12:25):**  Now when we spelt out those things, and very roughly, but everybody in total agreement,  
**[0:12:33-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:12:33):**  because you don't even compromise, you don't allow, as a facilitator, if there'd been any  
**[0:12:38-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:12:38):**  disagreement, I'd have just kept discussion going until there's no compromise, there's  
**[0:12:42-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:12:42):**  total agreement.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:12:44):**  And then once we had that, the whole atmosphere changed.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:12:48):**  It was suddenly just 35 human beings dealing with each other.  
**[0:12:54-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:12:54):**  And by the end of the day, we had an agricultural policy that the world would dream of.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:13:02):**  And every bit of knowledge we needed was in the room.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:13:06):**  What wasn't in any government or room was the ability to facilitate the process of dealing  
**[0:13:15-0:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:13:15):**  with the complexity of culture and society, economy and environment.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:13:21):**  And when I did that by simple questioning and leading them through to what is the purpose  
**[0:13:27-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:13:27):**  of government in this, what is the purpose of a policy, therefore, who should be given  
**[0:13:33-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:13:33):**  instructions as to what actions take place on a farm?  
**[0:13:37-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:13:37):**  Should these be coming from the farmer or from a bureaucrat in the capital?  
**[0:13:42-0:13:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:13:42):**  The obvious answer is, well, it should be coming from the farmer.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:13:45):**  Then why in every government and in Europe are the instructions?  
**[0:13:50-0:13:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:13:50):**  Of course you're in trouble.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:13:52):**  So we just went through it like that.  
**[0:13:55-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:13:55):**  And that's just doing it.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:13:56):**  Yeah, that really does give a concrete example in what many people would think of being one  
**[0:14:02-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:14:02):**  of the most contentious environments that you could introduce a concept like this to  
**[0:14:06-0:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:14:06):**  break down barriers and the simplicity that is at the core of connecting with the things  
**[0:14:12-0:14:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:14:12):**  that we all have in common and getting people to unite on collaborating towards achieving  
**[0:14:19-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:14:19):**  those things and then breaking down through the problems that are in our way and looking  
**[0:14:24-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:14:24):**  for solutions that benefit everyone.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:14:27):**  It seems and I've seen it in practice as well, both through the courses that I've taken and  
**[0:14:31-0:14:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:14:31):**  in applications of practitioners that I've met.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:14:36):**  Much like you said, it's the complex it's overcomplicating this concept and trying to  
**[0:14:41-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:14:41):**  add extra things, special studies and all of that, that that breaks down the core of  
**[0:14:47-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:14:47):**  the agreement that is inherent in everybody.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:14:51):**  And you have a template in your book that is a generic, holistic context, which touches  
**[0:14:57-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:14:57):**  on a lot of these core things.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:14:59):**  Can you tell me about how you came up with that and like how widely it is applied and  
**[0:15:05-0:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:15:05):**  maybe what it's missing that people can add on to for their specific context, if they're  
**[0:15:10-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:15:10):**  using it as a starting point?  
**[0:15:11-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:15:11):**  I wouldn't get anybody to add on to that at all.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:15:15):**  I'd get them just to develop their own.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:15:17):**  You ask how did I come up with that generic one?  
**[0:15:21-0:15:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:15:21):**  I sucked my thumb.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:15:24):**  Literally, I just sat with my pencil and paper and said, I've worked all over the world.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:15:29):**  I've worked with Indians, Pakistanis, with Arabs, with Englishmen, with Americans, with  
**[0:15:36-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:15:36):**  Germans, with Swedes, you know, I've worked with people all around the world.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:15:41):**  I'm a human being like others.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:15:43):**  How do most people want their lives to be?  
**[0:15:46-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:15:46):**  It's the same.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:15:47):**  Why the hell are we killing each other?  
**[0:15:50-0:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:15:50):**  It's because we all are managing in a reductionist way.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:15:54):**  We're meeting our needs and our desires and solving problems and we end in conflict, go  
**[0:15:59-0:16:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:15:59):**  to war.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:16:00):**  So I just simply wrote, how would we want our lives to be, etc.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:16:05):**  Now, if people just copy that, or add to that, it will have no meaning for them.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:16:12):**  So they won't change, their lives will just continue as they were.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:16:16):**  And that's the commonest problem I find, is people take what they wrote in the training  
**[0:16:21-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:16:21):**  course or whatever, and then forget it.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:16:25):**  Or they think, as I've heard many say, that the constant, the checks to see if your actions  
**[0:16:33-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:16:33):**  are in line with the holistic context, they think that's the key to those seven checks.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:16:40):**  And it isn't.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:16:41):**  The key to managing holistically is just the depth of commitment and ownership.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:16:47):**  And the hardest thing anybody has to do, literally, is just develop their own holistic context.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:16:56):**  With help if need be, but deeply thought out, deep in here, you would die rather than not  
**[0:17:04-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:17:04):**  live a life like that.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:17:07):**  Don't say your children mean more, they should be in there.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:17:13):**  Don't say your religion means more, it should be in there.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:17:16):**  There are no excuses.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:17:18):**  When that holistic context of yours is written down, it should mean more to you than anything  
**[0:17:24-0:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:17:24):**  in life.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:17:26):**  Now you will just begin to do that, and your life will just begin to go that way.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:17:32):**  The context checks are only for complicated cases, arguments, where people can't quite  
**[0:17:39-0:17:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:17:39):**  agree yet.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:17:40):**  Two ideas would meet all the requirements.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:17:43):**  Now which one do we do?  
**[0:17:45-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:17:45):**  Let's go through the context checks, and then usually one will drop out.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:17:49):**  And then people are happy with that, because we'll go ahead with this action first, and  
**[0:17:54-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:17:54):**  then that one will follow, and so on.  
**[0:17:56-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:17:56):**  So the context checks have their place.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:17:59):**  But the ownership in the holistic context is what brings it about.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:18:04):**  I mean, I've been able to save my property in Africa, it's now serving the whole nation,  
**[0:18:12-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:18:12):**  and I've gone through over 4000 farms and ranches taken over by the government.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:18:17):**  I went through long civil war, everything, I've been able to maintain that.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:18:21):**  Why?  
**[0:18:22-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:18:22):**  Because I was managing holistically.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:18:24):**  And I never confused ownership with management.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:18:29):**  And when I developed my holistic context, I realized what I value, it was the life of  
**[0:18:36-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:18:36):**  living in Africa, with the poor people that I really like in rural communities, with the  
**[0:18:44-0:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:18:44):**  wildlife of Africa, I didn't value the ownership in the land.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:18:49):**  And so one of my first decisions holistically, when I could get back at the end of our war,  
**[0:18:56-0:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:18:56):**  was to give the land away.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:18:58):**  And by giving the land away, and making the chiefs trustees, I'm still living there amongst  
**[0:19:05-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:19:05):**  the wildlife and still working with the people.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:19:08):**  35 years later, that's managing holistically, far from perfectly.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:19:16):**  But I'm very happy there.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:19:18):**  And now it's doing immense good for the whole of Africa.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:19:21):**  Wow.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:19:22):**  Look, we're starting to get to the end of this.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:19:24):**  And I want to ask one very candid question here, because it's been a personal struggle  
**[0:19:29-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:19:29):**  for me that I noticed earlier while I was understanding some of the concepts in this,  
**[0:19:35-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:19:35):**  and really stopped me from making progress in the beginning.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:19:39):**  And I it took me a while to realize this.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:19:41):**  But as I started to see the steps that were required to get in touch with the things that  
**[0:19:47-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:19:47):**  are important to you for your personal context, I put off doing things like this for a long  
**[0:19:54-0:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:19:54):**  time.  
**[0:19:55-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:19:55):**  And I now realize it was because I was afraid that this was going to bring to light all  
**[0:19:59-0:20:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:19:59):**  of the poor ways that I was making decisions and managing things in the past.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:20:03):**  And it took me a while to get past that.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:20:06):**  And to realize that so many more things could open up to me if I got past the ego aspect  
**[0:20:11-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:20:11):**  of this attachment to the way that I had been doing things.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:20:15):**  Because like many other people, I struggled to make those decisions.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:20:19):**  I put time into it, I put a lot of effort into it, I put a lot of money into some of  
**[0:20:23-0:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:20:23):**  the decisions that had kind of governed my life in the direction I had gone in.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:20:27):**  Do you have any advice or some insights into what it takes to get past the expectations  
**[0:20:35-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:20:35):**  that or even the realization that a lot of the ways that you've been making decisions  
**[0:20:39-0:20:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:20:39):**  are managing your life up until this point has been self-destructive.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:20:44):**  That there are more clear and selfless ways to do that, that can still benefit you in  
**[0:20:51-0:20:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:20:51):**  the direction you're trying to go.  
**[0:20:52-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:20:52):**  Well, you know, you're asking me deep stuff that I really don't have answers to.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:21:00):**  I just do know that earlier part of your question, when you're developing your own holistic context,  
**[0:21:09-0:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:21:09):**  it's very private.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:21:11):**  So many people just develop it with others, share it with others.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:21:16):**  It's not like a mission statement.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:21:18):**  It's not branding.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:21:19):**  It's deep stuff.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:21:21):**  Mine is very private to me.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:21:23):**  I've shown it to a couple of family members, a few others, when I've been trying to use  
**[0:21:27-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:21:27):**  it for a teaching purpose.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:21:28):**  Mine is very short, but it's very deep.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:21:31):**  I literally would die rather than not live the life I described in mine.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:21:39):**  So it's very personal, keep it personal.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:21:41):**  And then, yes, it takes a long time.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:21:43):**  It took me a long time to get to one of the things that is helping me a lot in later life.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:21:51):**  Let me actually take the risk of mentioning this because it might help other people.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:21:57):**  In describing my behavior, I described how I would have to behave with honor, dignity,  
**[0:22:04-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:22:04):**  professionalism, a good attitude, always to the best of my ability, et cetera.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:22:12):**  And I had that there for years.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:22:15):**  And then when I redid it, as I do every year or so, when I redid it last, I was sitting  
**[0:22:23-0:22:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:22:23):**  just under the trees in Africa with a pencil and paper.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:22:27):**  And as I thought of that, I thought, you know, you're just fooling yourself.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:22:32):**  You're not fooling other people.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:22:34):**  You're not always behaving in this manner.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:22:38):**  Now cut the bullshit because you're only talking to yourself.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:22:43):**  Now is there anything I should change here?  
**[0:22:45-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:22:45):**  And I did.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:22:46):**  I put one thing and I put it was to deeply question my own motive before any action.  
**[0:22:54-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:22:54):**  And even before I pushed the send button on an email, now I will sit and say, what is  
**[0:23:00-0:23:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:23:00):**  my motive?  
**[0:23:04-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:23:04):**  Am I doing this to have the last word, to score a point?  
**[0:23:08-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:23:08):**  Don't do it.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:23:10):**  Don't do it.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:23:12):**  It's got to be for the best of motives, the best of outcomes, et cetera.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:23:16):**  Now that's deep stuff.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:23:17):**  I'm a little awkward talking about it, but I do.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:23:23):**  And when you sit with that honesty with yourself, it's embarrassing to suddenly realize, my  
**[0:23:28-0:23:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:23:28):**  God, I was about to do something stupid.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:23:32):**  Now I didn't have that depth in it a year or two ago, two, three years ago.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:23:38):**  So it's with each of us, it'll keep them improving, I believe, but keep it personal.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:23:45):**  It is just your thing.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:23:47):**  If you're in a group, then it's a group one.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:23:49):**  If it's a company or any organization, then it's a group one as we have in the slavery  
**[0:23:54-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:23:54):**  institute and our hubs and so on, but your own, keep it very personal.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:24:00):**  If you're showing it to others, I'm doubting it has the depth it should have.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:24:06):**  Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:24:09):**  And it comes in line with one, a bit of advice that has served very useful for me, especially  
**[0:24:16-0:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:24:16):**  in the last handful of years is that my mindset is governed by the questions that I ask myself.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:24:21):**  And that seems like an extremely powerful one that's had a real impact on your life.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:24:27):**  It's a question that demands some real personal insight.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:24:31):**  And I can imagine that over the years, getting in the habit of asking yourself that regularly  
**[0:24:36-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:24:36):**  has caused you to think about all of your actions much more deeply as an automatic response  
**[0:24:41-0:24:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:24:41):**  before taking action or starting to implement them.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:24:48):**  Well, it didn't go that way with me because the personal stuff came in much, much later.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:24:56):**  I was just started as a 20, 21 year old young ecologist, first getting a glimmering that  
**[0:25:03-0:25:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:25:03):**  it was our management as professional ecologists in government that was leading to the biodiversity  
**[0:25:10-0:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:25:10):**  loss in future national parks.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:25:12):**  So I began studying, why is it that our management that is causing the problem, not poachers  
**[0:25:19-0:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:25:19):**  and all the things we're blaming.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:25:21):**  So all the way through, I was studying the land, the management, what's happening to  
**[0:25:26-0:25:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:25:26):**  people, not at this personal level, when the personal level only came in, when we'd had  
**[0:25:33-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:25:33):**  some amazing successes in the 60s and 70s.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:25:37):**  But it was still land, wildlife, cattle, crops.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:25:42):**  It wasn't a policy level or anything like that until that episode I mentioned when I  
**[0:25:47-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:25:47):**  came to America as a political refugee and was commissioned to train those 2000 scientists  
**[0:25:54-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:25:54):**  over two years.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:25:56):**  That's the point at which we finally broke through with the holistic context.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:26:02):**  And then when we realized, oh my God, this starts with us as individuals.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:26:08):**  So that came late in the day.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:26:11):**  My questioning up to that time had not been questioning personally as much as just questioning  
**[0:26:18-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:26:18):**  what the hell are we doing as professional people, what's happening to the land and the  
**[0:26:23-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:26:23):**  wildlife and the crops and the  
**[0:26:27-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:26:27):**  and farming and consulting and trying to sort this out.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:26:34):**  Always the same problem.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:26:35):**  Poor land means poor people, people, violence, war, etc.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:26:42):**  But I was just trying to sort that out.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:26:47):**  Now the insights and the advice that you've been giving me throughout this talk have really  
**[0:26:51-0:26:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:26:51):**  reflected the parts that are baked into the holistic management framework, which is humility.  
**[0:26:57-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:26:57):**  And it's one of the things that first really stuck out to me as I started to learn this  
**[0:27:01-0:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:27:01):**  in greater depth, how the assumption that you are wrong is a very big part of monitoring  
**[0:27:08-0:27:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:27:08):**  your decisions and especially in holistic financial management, not just assuming, but  
**[0:27:13-0:27:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:27:13):**  knowing that you're wrong from the beginning and constantly.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:27:17):**  Yeah, knowing that you're wrong is an essential part of moving forward and starting to work  
**[0:27:24-0:27:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:27:24):**  with the decisions that you've made.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:27:26):**  Can you talk about why that is so central and what it changes in your mindset before  
**[0:27:34-0:27:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:27:34):**  you start marching ahead with something that you've chosen?  
**[0:27:39-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:27:39):**  I don't know how it changes mindset, but I hope it does.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:27:43):**  I long ago realized first with the environment that I was wrong, like the elephant culling  
**[0:27:49-0:27:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:27:49):**  example I used in the TED talk where I was so wrong and all of us scientists were and  
**[0:27:56-0:28:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:27:56):**  they still are in pushing that line as they're doing.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:28:00):**  So with the environment is so complex that I've heard soil scientists one years ago make  
**[0:28:07-0:28:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:28:07):**  a statement that I loved.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:28:09):**  He said something about the complexity and a cubic inch of soil was so great that it  
**[0:28:15-0:28:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:28:15):**  might be beyond our understanding for all time.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:28:18):**  I love that.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:28:19):**  That's just a cubic inch of soil.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:28:21):**  So with the environmental actions, if we're taking a new action and managing holistically,  
**[0:28:27-0:28:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:28:27):**  no matter how much science is backed up with and everything else, we automatically assume  
**[0:28:32-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:28:32):**  we're wrong and monitor on that assumption.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:28:35):**  Now there's no danger.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:28:37):**  There's nothing but good that comes out of that.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:28:41):**  And we've seen that year after year.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:28:43):**  Now when it comes to the financial part of monitoring, remember we're managing nature,  
**[0:28:49-0:28:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:28:49):**  money and humans.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:28:51):**  When it comes to the money part of it, and you mentioned it a moment ago, when you do  
**[0:28:56-0:29:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:28:56):**  holistic financial planning, you don't assume you're wrong.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:29:00):**  You know damn well you're wrong because no plan ever works out exactly as you planned.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:29:07):**  So that one, we don't assume we're wrong.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:29:09):**  We know we're wrong.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:29:10):**  And we establish the monitoring of the plan and the controlling of the plan, et cetera,  
**[0:29:15-0:29:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:29:15):**  to keep the process going.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:29:19):**  Now when it comes to the human part of it, when we're dealing with humans, as we always  
**[0:29:24-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:29:24):**  are as well, we do not assume we're wrong.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:29:28):**  There's again, good science behind that, the Pygmalion effect.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:29:32):**  If you assume something about a person, their behavior does begin to reflect it.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:29:37):**  And there's good science behind that.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:29:39):**  So if I assume that I can't trust you, I'll end up not trusting, whatever.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:29:45):**  So with the human side of it, we do not assume we're wrong, but we monitor for early signs  
**[0:29:51-0:29:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:29:51):**  and use the scientific work there from people like Virginia Satter and the early signs of  
**[0:29:59-0:30:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:29:59):**  dysfunction that you spot in people, the body language, et cetera, and then try to control  
**[0:30:07-0:30:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:30:07):**  and replan if we have to.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:30:11):**  But if you assume you're wrong, you will make yourself wrong on that one.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:30:16):**  So the three are treated slightly differently.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:30:19):**  Environment, yes, we assume we're wrong and monitor accordingly.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:30:26):**  Economics we know damn well we're wrong, so we monitor accordingly.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:30:30):**  And with the humans, no, you assume the best in people and have to be by trust.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:30:37):**  And then you monitor for signs that that's going right.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:30:41):**  It's a very vital part of it because we are dealing with complexity, the management of  
**[0:30:47-0:30:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:30:47):**  complexity.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:30:49):**  And we're right at our infancy, as I said earlier, on how to do that.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:30:53):**  Indeed.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:30:54):**  Well, look, Alan, you've been very generous with your time.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:30:58):**  I've really enjoyed this talk.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:31:00):**  It's really illuminated a lot of things that were still hang ups for me as I continue down  
**[0:31:06-0:31:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:31:06):**  the path of learning in this area.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:31:08):**  And it's already been extremely profound in helping me make decisions and manage even  
**[0:31:13-0:31:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:31:13):**  small things in my life.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:31:14):**  And I will be respectful of your time and let you go here.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:31:18):**  I really hope that you feel better and get over your cold soon.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:31:21):**  And I really look forward to speaking to you again on the expert panel call that we have  
**[0:31:25-0:31:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:31:25):**  coming up at the end of the month.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:31:27):**  Okay, Oliver.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:31:28):**  Well, thanks for the talk and last two words.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:31:32):**  Don't apply it and keep it very simple.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:31:35):**  I'm just going to strike that word from my vocabulary.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:31:39):**  But it's like so many other things.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:31:40):**  As soon as you say that's the wrong word, that was the only word that could come into  
**[0:31:44-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:31:44):**  my mind.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:31:45):**  Okay.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:31:46):**  Good luck to you.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:31:47):**  Thank you so much, Alan.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:31:48):**  Take care.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:31:49):**  Have a good day.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:31:51):**  All right.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:31:52):**  Thanks again to Alan Savory and his wife, Jody Butterfield, who was so helpful in setting  
**[0:31:57-0:31:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:31:57):**  up this call.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:31:58):**  That concludes this two part interview with Alan.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:32:00):**  But if you're interested in hearing more from him, I'll be publishing the expert panel call  
**[0:32:04-0:32:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:32:04):**  with him as well as Rudolf Bühler of the Schloss Kirschberg Farming Association in  
**[0:32:09-0:32:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:32:09):**  Germany, and Ana de Gon of the Agri-Culture Arrangenarativa Network in Spain in just a  
**[0:32:14-0:32:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:32:14):**  few weeks.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:32:15):**  So keep an eye out for that.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:32:17):**  Until then, you can find out more about Alan's work through the Savory Institute at savory.global.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:32:23):**  And I also highly recommend the holistic management online training that I'm currently on with  
**[0:32:27-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:32:27):**  Sheila Cook and 3LM.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:32:30):**  And you can find out all about their educational resources at 3LM.network.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:32:35):**  Before you go, remember that these episodes are only the beginning of the ongoing conversations  
**[0:32:39-0:32:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:32:39):**  happening around these topics on the Regenerative Skills Discord server.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:32:44):**  It's always free for you.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:32:45):**  And unlike other social media platforms that were created with complex algorithms used  
**[0:32:49-0:32:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:32:49):**  to mine your personal data in order to sell you more junk, this channel was created for  
**[0:32:54-0:33:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:32:54):**  the free exchange of ideas, stories, and mutual support among the growing regenerative pioneers.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:33:00):**  Over the next couple of weeks, we'll be exploring questions like,  
**[0:33:04-0:33:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:33:04):**  What aspects of the things that you currently manage do you feel are going well, and which  
**[0:33:08-0:33:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:33:08):**  could benefit from being analyzed for areas of improvement?  
**[0:33:12-0:33:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:33:12):**  What indicators do you look for to let you know if your management decisions are working  
**[0:33:17-0:33:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:33:17):**  as planned or need to be replanned?  
**[0:33:20-0:33:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:33:20):**  As an example, I've been managing my in-person workshops in a way that has me rebuilding  
**[0:33:25-0:33:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:33:25):**  the template from scratch nearly every time I plan a new course.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:33:28):**  And yet I've noticed that there are many similar patterns in what is needed for all  
**[0:33:32-0:33:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:33:32):**  of the courses that I teach, regardless of topic, and I'm seeing opportunities to create  
**[0:33:37-0:33:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:33:37):**  a template, a general template, that can be repurposed for all of my workshops, which  
**[0:33:42-0:33:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:33:42):**  could save me a ton of time in planning and preparation.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:33:45):**  Now if you're interested in joining the Discord and exploring these questions with  
**[0:33:49-0:33:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:33:49):**  me, just check out the link on our Instagram account or on the homepage of the website  
**[0:33:54-0:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:33:54):**  at RegenerativeSkills.com.  
**[0:33:55-0:34:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:33:55):**  Now that's our show for this week, don't forget to keep taking those little steps every  
**[0:34:00-0:34:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/allan-savory-on-managing-complexity-holistically-part-2/#t=0:34:00):**  day towards a regenerative future, and I'll be right by your side along the way.
